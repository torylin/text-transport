# Text-Transport

Text-Transport is a method for estimating the causal effects of linguistic attributes on an outcome of interest. Current approaches for valid causal effect estimation require strong assumptions about the data, meaning the data from which
one can estimate valid causal effects often is not representative of the actual target domain of interest. Text-Transport proposes an estimator that *transports* causal effects from a valid—but potentially limited—source domain to *any* target domain, bypassing the need for strong assumptions in the target domain. For more information, please see our paper, [Text-Transport: Toward Learning Causal Effects of Natural Language]() (to appear at EMNLP 2023).
