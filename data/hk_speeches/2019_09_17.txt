  Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with 
the people of Hong Kong.
  Last month, I had the opportunity to hear directly from leaders in 
Hong Kong dedicated to both religious tolerance and to democracy, as 
promised in the ``one country, two systems'' agreement.
  The people of Hong Kong wave American flags during their protests as 
a symbol of the freedoms that they desire.
  Now is the time for Congress to support the people of Hong Kong and 
pass Representative Chris Smith's bill, the Hong Kong Human Rights and 
Democracy Act. This measure states without question that the United 
States Government supports the people of Hong Kong and their right to 
freedom of expression and democratic governance guaranteed under their 
50-year arrangement agreed to in 1997 by China and the United Kingdom.
