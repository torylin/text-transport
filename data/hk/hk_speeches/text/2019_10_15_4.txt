  Mr. LaMALFA. Madam Speaker, while LeBron James, Steve Kerr, and 
seemingly most of the NBA shamefully refuse to stand up to Chinese 
authoritarianism for fear of it affecting their future business 
investments, the free world is watching.
  For months, the Chinese Government has been badly mistreating those 
protesting for a freer form of government in Hong Kong. But those facts 
are inconvenient for the National Basketball Association.
  Tear gas, rubber bullets, concentration camps for religious 
minorities, these are just a few of the tactics employed on those who 
only seek freedom from a police state under communist rule.
  That is why, tonight, Congress unanimously passed multiple bipartisan 
measures to hold China accountable for its brutality, including banning 
the export to China of crowd-control weapons, and strongly condemning 
Chinese interference in Hong Kong's affairs.
  The people of Hong Kong have a right to protest for an open 
government amidst the shackles of communism and authoritarianism.
  Despite what LeBron James says, Congress is educated on this matter, 
and we stand with the protestors in Hong Kong. I wish more of the NBA 
would wake up and show some backbone, too.
