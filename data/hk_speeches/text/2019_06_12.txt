  Mr. President, finally, 30 years and one week ago, democratic 
protestors gathered at Tiananmen Square, where the Chinese Communist 
Party brutally suppressed the will of the people.
  Today, in Hong Kong, a similar scene is playing out. The Chinese 
government is once again showing its true colors, suppressing 
democracy, denying the will of the people, trying to claw back more 
power and control.
  The people of Hong Kong are rightfully protesting the Chinese 
government's interest in remanding potentially innocent people to 
mainland China in order to put them through the corrupt Chinese prison 
system.
  America stands with the people of Hong Kong in their protest against 
this blatant abuse of power by the government in Beijing.
