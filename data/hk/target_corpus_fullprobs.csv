"Madam President, over the past few days and weeks, reports about the democratic protests in Hong Kong have grown more and more troubling. The authorities in Hong Kong have cracked down violently on some of the protesters, firing hundreds of rounds of tear gas at a local university and even using lethal force in a few tragic situations. As many have observed, some of the pictures coming out of Hong Kong are reminiscent of a war zone."
"Yesterday, the Chinese Communist Party dealt another blow to Hong Kong's special status, criticizing the ruling by the territory's High Court that reversed the Hong Kong Government's ban on masks. The Communist Party declared that only the Chinese legislature has the right to decide whether Hong Kong's laws are consistent with the Hong Kong basic law and that no other authority has the right to make these judgments. That assertion by the Chinese Communist Party is a direct assault on Hong Kong's judicial independence. Make no mistake about it, this Communist Party is cruel and relentless in cracking down on any dissent in every part of China."
"What they are doing to the Uighurs at the other end of the Chinese country--far away from Hong Kong--is just brutal and awful. We in the United States stand in solidarity with the democratic protesters, who have every right to assemble and petition their government for the rights of the citizens of Hong Kong. The administration and the President himself should voice their support for the protesters in Hong Kong, which would send an important message to the Chinese Communist Party not to get involved or in any way escalate the situation."
"Secretary Pompeo's call for calm yesterday is weak tea--not close to enough. Beyond the Presidential statement, there are actions we can take here in Congress because, frankly, I have been very disappointed that the President, in this dramatic situationwith Hong Kong, does not do what Democratic or Republican Presidents have done in the past in standing up for human rights and democracy. He has not done that. He doesn't seem to care."
"As we know, he seems more eager to please dictators than to please those who are fighting for democracy. We have a bipartisan bill in the Senate that has many cosponsors, including the senior Senators from Florida and New Jersey and from Maryland as well, that would reaffirm our steadfast support for Hong Kong's autonomy, democracy, and respect for human rights. It would amend the Hong Kong Policy Act in order to give us the tools to safeguard and protect Hong Kong's democracy and autonomy and hold accountable those responsible for the abuse of the human rights of the people of Hong Kong. There is no objection to this bill on the Democratic side of the aisle."
"We believe the Senate should pass it. If there are objections on the Republicans' side, let's take a few days and work through the bill on the floor. We haven't done much legislation."
"Here is a place at which we can come together in a bipartisan way. So, if there are no objections, great. Let's pass it this afternoon."
"I believe the Senator from Florida will make a unanimous consent request in that regard. If there are objections, I urge the Republican leader, who has spoken out and defended the protests, to take a few days. Let someone try to invoke cloture--it will fail miserably--and let's vote on this."
"Then, maybe, the House will pass it. That would be something, I think, that would happen and with the President as well. In addition, the Senator from Oregon, along with some others, has a bill that U.S. companies shouldn't sell lethal types of equipment to the Hong Kong police that have been used on the protesters. I would hope we could find a way to work that proposal into this bill or, maybe, we could make a unanimous consent request alongside it."
"Nonetheless, we should pass the bipartisan bill in the Senate, reconcile it with similar legislation in the House, and quickly send it to the President's desk. It would be the strongest action Congress could take immediately to demonstrate Americans' support for the protests in Hong Kong. It would send a strong and clear message to the ruling party in Beijing."
"It would make a real difference. The words on the floor the Republican leader mentioned yesterday were good but were not sufficient. Again, I urge him to move on this legislation, if we can, by unanimous consent. If not, let's have a debate on the floor so the handful of Senators who might try to block it are thwarted, and the bill will move forward."
"Madam Speaker, while LeBron James, Steve Kerr, and seemingly most of the NBA shamefully refuse to stand up to Chinese authoritarianism for fear of it affecting their future business investments, the free world is watching. For months, the Chinese Government has been badly mistreating those protesting for a freer form of government in Hong Kong. But those facts are inconvenient for the National Basketball Association."
"Tear gas, rubber bullets, concentration camps for religious minorities, these are just a few of the tactics employed on those who only seek freedom from a police state under communist rule. That is why, tonight, Congress unanimously passed multiple bipartisan measures to hold China accountable for its brutality, including banning the export to China of crowd-control weapons, and strongly condemning Chinese interference in Hong Kong's affairs. The people of Hong Kong have a right to protest for an open government amidst the shackles of communism and authoritarianism. Despite what LeBron James says, Congress is educated on this matter, and we stand with the protestors in Hong Kong."
"I wish more of the NBA would wake up and show some backbone, too."
"Madam President, last week I spoke about the people's uprising in Hong Kong. Over the past several days, millions of residents have taken to the streets to defend their autonomy and the rule of law from continued encroachment of the communist government of mainland China. After days of tension, this past weekend brought some good news."
"In a sign that the people's demonstrations had sent a clear message, Hong Kong officials now said that the government will suspend consideration of the proposed ``extradition'' bill indefinitely. The fate of Hong Kong and its special status is a subject I have watched carefully for decades. Early on in my Senate tenure, I introduced the legislation that still governs our relationship with Hong Kong, the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, which President Bush 41 signed into law. On the day I introduced that legislation, I said it was heartening to see that ``democracy is finally gaining a tenuous foot hold in Hong Kong.''"
"Well, the nearly 30 years since then have shown us all just what the people of Hong Kong can do when the terms of their independence and freedom are respected. We have seen Hong Kong thrive, in large measure due to the political and economic freedoms and stable rule of law that Hong Kong's special status has enabled, but we have also seen clearly in recent days that freedom's foothold in the shadow of mainland China is not a given. It remains tenuous even now."
"I wanted to again express my admiration for the people of Hong Kong and their strong but peaceful response to this proposed encroachment. I am glad to see their leaders respect their willingness to stand their ground, and I hope the city's authorities will continue to respect the clear will of the people on these issues moving forward."
"Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for his support of democracy and democratic freedom in Hong Kong. I want to salute my colleague, Representative Smith of New Jersey, with whom I have worked for decades on this subject, whether it is for religious freedom or freedom of expression in China. I thank Mr. McGovern for his important leadership as chair of the China Commission and as chair of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission."
"Right now, we are on the PROTECT Hong Kong Act, as amended, by Mr. McGovern, and I rise in support of that legislation and, indeed, the bills that are on the floor to support democratic freedom in Hong Kong. Mr. Speaker, for 4 months, the young people of Hong Kong have sent a stirring message to the world that the dreams of freedom, justice, and democracy can never be extinguished by injustice and intimidation. The extraordinary outpouring of courage from the people of Hong Kong stands in stark contrast to a cowardly government that refuses to respect the rule of law or live up to the ``one country, two systems'' framework, which was guaranteed more than two decades ago. In 1984, before the United Kingdom transferred Hong Kong to China, the Chinese Government promised a high degree of autonomy for the territory in the Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong, providing for an independent executive, legislature, and judiciary; ensuring the freedom of speech, press, assembly, and religion; prohibiting the central government, the Chinese Government in Beijing, from interfering in the affairs that Hong Kong administers on its own according to the Basic Law; and pledging a path to universal suffrage."
"In 1997--that is when we were here doing this--when the handover occurred, America was hopeful that the people of Hong Kong would achieve this high degree of autonomy that they were promised, and this was a promise that was participated in by the U.K. Government. Today, we must sadly conclude that China has broken that promise. For years, the people of Hong Kong have faced a barrage of unjust and harsh restrictions on their freedoms, and those who have stood up for their rights have been met with a cruel crackdown."
"In Congress, Democrats and Republicans, in the House and in the Senate, stand united with the people of Hong Kong. If America does not speak out for human rights in China because of commercial interests, then we lose all moral authority to speak out for human rights anyplace in the world. Since Tiananmen Square 30 years ago, many of us, in a bipartisan way, have been fighting this fight, and we have seen that commercial interests always win. It is always about the money."
"I lost my innocence on human rights in America and China all those years ago when I saw that, while we talked a good talk, when it came right down to it, it was always about the money. Again, to those who want to take the repressive government's side in this discussion, I say to you: What does it profit a person if he gains the whole world and suffers the loss of his soul? We do not want to lose the soul of our country for commercial interests, whatever those commercial interests may be. It is interesting to hear people say we have to know both sides of the story."
"Do you want to hear both sides? One side is a very repressive regime that is crushing democratic freedoms in Hong Kong at the same time that they have tried to destroy the culture, the language, and the religion, all at the same time as they incarcerate in reeducation camps more than 1 million--it could be 3 million--Uyghur Muslims in China, or they repress religious freedom there. The list goes on and on."
"And the other side: young people speaking out for freedoms, democratic freedoms, in Hong Kong. They are so impressive. Mr. Smith and I have worked, as Mr. McGovern has, with some three generations, starting after Tiananmen Square and tanks rolling over young people who spoke out for democratic freedoms in China; the next generation, a couple, 15 years later; and now this generation of young people, so impressive are they that even the more seniorfreedom fighters in Hong Kong are impressed by their courage and their stick-to-itiveness."
"Today, the House is proud to pass the bicameral and bipartisan Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act to reaffirm America's commitment to democracy. And that doesn't mean a democracy like this. It means democratic freedoms, human rights, and the rule of law in the face of Beijing's crackdown."
"{time}  1615  And Beijing thinks that they can rule because of money. It always comes down to that. I thank Chairman McGovern and Congressman Smith for their work to ensure an honest accounting of the situation in Hong Kong, and to ensure accountability for those responsible for the crackdown. We are grateful to Chairman McGovern for his leadership on this PROTECT Hong Kong Act which suspends sales of crowd control technology and other equipment to the Hong Kong Police Force, as Mr. Sherman pointed out earlier."
"I thank Mr. Sherman for his work on this and thank him for his resolution calling for the Hong Kong Government to address protestors' demands and condemning police brutality, in addition to China's efforts to falsely accuse U.S. diplomats of fueling unrest. Last week, Martin Lee, the grandfather of Hong Kong democracy--we started working with him decades ago--said: ``We fear Hong Kong will become just another Chinese city.'' That means one without any of the freedoms that they were guaranteed."
"The future of Hong Kong, the future of autonomy, freedom, and justice for millions is at stake. America must stand with Hong Kong. It is very interesting that in the first weeks of the demonstration, the first months of the demonstration, 2 million people, mostly young people, were in the streets. And people were saying: Oh, my heavens, 2 million people turning out. And you remember that 2 million is 25 percent of the population of Hong Kong which is 8 million people."
It is 25 percent of the population that was in the streets. And the beat goes on.
"Hopefully, they will hear from this Congress our support for their human rights, and that we will not sell our souls for money at the expense of our values. I also want to thank the distinguished chairman of the committee, Mr. Eliot Engel, for his leadership on all of this over time. I urge an ``aye'' vote on all of the above to join in bipartisan, bicameral support for the people of Hong Kong. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey."
"Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the author of this important bill, a stalwart supporter of human rights. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from California for his leadership. I rise in support of H.R. 4270, the Placing Restrictions On Teargas Exports and Crowd Control Technology to Hong Kong Act, the PROTECT Hong Kong Act."
"I am proud to have introduced this bipartisan legislation, along with my colleagues Chris Smith and Ro Khanna, that responds to the excessive and unnecessary use of force by the Hong Kong police, targeting those engaged in peaceful protest. I want to thank the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee for bringing this bill so quickly before the House for consideration. The PROTECT Hong Kong Act prohibits U.S. exports of defense articles, munitions, and police equipment to Hong Kong. Specifically, it stops U.S. exports of teargas, pepper spray, grenades, rubber bullets, guns, semiautomatic rifles, and such defense articles and munitions to the police. Let's be clear about what is happening in Hong Kong right now."
"Millions of people from all walks of life, including: young people, students, women, seniors, entrepreneurs, teachers, civil servants, and workers are standing up to the most powerful, authoritarian government in the world. Protesters have inspired the world as they risk their lives, their health, their jobs, and their education to fight for the future of Hong Kong. They are savvy and strategic. They are using technology to mobilize, stay anonymous, and organize. They are capturing and extinguishing teargas containers. They have taken down, taken apart, and shown the world increasing surveillance cameras that monitor everyday Hong Kongers."
"They are using art, music, laser pointers, and the projection of messages on building to highlight their struggle. They organized a human chain of 200,000 people spanning 37 miles. Tenants in Hong Kong's residential buildings organize the shouting of slogans from their windows every night with calls and responses echoing throughout the city. The people of Hong Kong have made their voices loud and clear."
"But instead of listening to them, the Chinese and Hong Kong Governments have mishandled the situation at every turn. The world has now seen eyewitness evidence compiled by journalists and the media showing that police have used excessive force and used equipment in violation of manufacturer guidelines and international standards."
"We have seen the police firing rubber bullets and bean bag rounds at peaceful protesters at close range. We have seen them launching teargas canisters, from high buildings and directly at individuals, into crowded and enclosed areas. We have seen them failing to give demonstrators visible and audible warning before firing, and we have seen them use batons to beat and subdue demonstrators and disperse journalists. In fact, the situation has been so bad that in June, the British Government suspended export licenses for the sale of teargas and crowd control equipment until concerns about human rights abuses are addressed."
"On August 13, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights called for an investigation of the use of crowd control tactics in Hong Kong. It is time for American companies to stop selling weapons that are being used to suppress peaceful protests. Instead of heeding international calls to stop the crackdown, the Hong Kong Government continues to make matters worse."
"On October 1 alone, 269 arrests of protesters, spanning the ages of 12 to 71 were made. Two teenage protesters had been shot with live ammunition, and the uptick of violence against journalists has further served to inflame public anger against the government and the police. Instead of establishing an independent commission of inquiry on police conduct to deescalate the situation, the Hong Kong Government has formally invoked the Emergency Regulations Ordinance to ban the use of masks during public assemblies. This is an impractical and draconian step to move the city closer to martial law. The Hong Kong Government should repeal this regulation and refrain from bypassing oversight and scrutiny by the legislative council in making ad hoc regulations."
"An intensified crackdown will only escalate and promote violence, and further tarnish the reputation of Hong Kong and its police force. At a minimum, it is beyond time for Congress to send a clear message that the United States supports the people of Hong Kong, and that we will no longer provide assistance to crack down on pro-democracy protesters. I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 4270, the PROTECT Hong Kong Act."
"Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me say, I appreciate and respect the eloquent remarks of the Speaker just a few moments ago."
"We are united on Hong Kong. I think that is very clear, and we have been working together, along with a number of other Members, including some former Members, like Frank Wolf from Virginia, who are united in believing that freedom, and democracy, and respect for human rights is everybody's business, and everybody is entitled to it."
"These are God-given rights. So, again, I want to thank the Speaker for her wonderful remarks. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4270, the PROTECT Hong Kong Act, sponsored by Chairman  Jim McGovern, and I am very proud to be a cosponsor on it."
"The PROTECT Hong Kong Act mandates export restrictions on defense articles and munitions to the Hong Kong police. As the largest protest movement Hong Kong has ever seen continues into its fifth month, major concerns have arisen about the Hong Kong police's independence and professionalism. The people of Hong Kong are rightfully furious about well-documented cases of excessive force, brutal tactics, and the tolerance of violence against protesters and journalists by the government. The Hong Kong police's actions are now a cause in and of themselves of protest."
"There has been widespread police misuse of crowd control equipment and less lethal weaponry, including incidents that have seriously injured journalists. Police have used teargas, rubber bullets, water cannons, sponge grenades, pepper spray, and batons against demonstrators, some of which, indeed, are American-made equipment. In recent weeks two protesters have been shot with live rounds."
"Meanwhile, while we discuss a move to ban the sale of such offensive equipment, the Hong Kong Government, via executive fiat, has simultaneously moved to ban the use by demonstrators of defensive equipment used to protect themselves against police attacks; namely, gas masks and face masks. The PROTECT Hong Kong Act will prohibit the issuing of licenses for the export of munitions and crowd control equipment to the Hong Kong police. The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and other relevant Federal agencies, will also be required to issue a report on what has been sold to the Hong Kong police over the past several years. These prohibitions will remain in effect until these incidents are independently examined and the Hong Kong police have demonstrated truly professional conduct. In sum, the U.S. should not be complicit in any way, shape, or form in violence being used to squash the legitimate demands guaranteed to the Hong Kong people by international treaty."
"That is unacceptable, and it is contrary to U.S. interests, and it is contrary to U.S. law. I strongly support unanimous support for this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel), the chair of the full Foreign Affairs Committee, a stalwart supporter of human rights."
"Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding to me. He is a valued member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee."
Let me start by thanking Mr. McGovern for his hard work on this legislation. The relationship between the United States and Hong Kong is rooted in our shared values.
"Among them are a fierce belief in the freedom of speech, and the right to assemble. That is why the American people are so troubled by the images coming out of Hong Kong lately. Hundreds of thousands of protesters who have taken to the streets have been met with increasing violence by the Hong Kong Police Force. These pro-democracy activists faced teargas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets by the police force sworn to supposedly protect them. I remember when China took over Hong Kong from the U.K. and said that they would adhere to a system of two systems in China, and that the people of Hong Kong would have freedom like they had before to speak their mind."
"And here it is, probably about 20 years later, and that is already being eroded, taken away, and the people of Hong Kong see that they were promised something which isn't being brought forth from the Beijing regime. Mr. McGovern's measure would ensure that American companies are not contributing equipment for the Hong Kong police to use against protesters. This bill also calls on the police to take the steps needed to address those issues from within."
"When there are instances of police brutality, there must be prompt, independent investigations and proper accountability. The PROTECT Hong Kong Act shows the people of Hong Kong that the United States stands with them in their fight for their freedoms. It makes sure that American companies are not facilitating violence against brave Democratic protesters. It is a shame that it has come to this, but it is really uplifting to watch people possess enormous courage in the wake of having their lives threatened."
"In the wake of having their society destroyed, they stood up and they are standing up to the Beijing regime and to the people who would try to strip them of their basic freedoms. I think that we all, no matter where we are on this planet, have to admire the brave people of Hong Kong. We had the good fortune of meeting a number of the protesters when Speaker Pelosi called a press conference a few weeks ago, and we talked about this bill. It was really heartening to be able to speak to these young people one-on-one."
"These are young people who have shown just enormous amounts of courage. And they should know that the United States will always support them, will continue to support them, and we won't stop until the people of Hong Kong have their democracy and the freedom they deserve. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. {time}  1630  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, so I yield back the balance of my time."
"Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for the purpose of closing. The people of Hong Kong have the right to peaceably assemble without fear of violence. They need to know that their friends in the United States are not providing tools of the violent repression being used against them."
"Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support H.R. 4270, and I urge all Members of the House to do likewise. I yield back the balance of my time."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4270, the ``PROTECT Hong Kong Act.''"
"4270 calls for the President to prohibit the issuance of export licenses for nonlethal crowd control items and defense articles to the Hong Kong police. This prohibition will be terminated once the Hong Kong police have stopped engaging in a pattern of gross human rights abuses, and there has been an independent investigation conducted on policy brutality. During the 2019 anti-extradition bill and pro-democracy protests, the Hong Kong Police Force used non-lethal crowd control articles such as water cannon trucks, tear gas, rubber bullets, sponge grenades, beanbag rounds, batons, pepper spray, pepper balls, and projectile launchers. Hong Kong citizens and the international community have called for changes to the Hong Kong Police's crowd control tactics and these requests have gone unheeded by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government. I applaud the efforts and sacrifices pro-democracy activists have made and they ought to know that the United States fully supports their desire for freedom and peace, and we strongly condemn the violent and oppressive tactics of the Hong Kong police."
"When enacted, H.R. 4270 will prohibit the issuance of licenses to export covered defense articles and services and covered munitions items to the Hong Kong Disciplined Services. As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security I find it important to increase bilateral relations with allies and abroad to help eliminate the injustices of the world."
"Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 4270 to confront the pattern of gross human rights abuses which pose a strong threat to the democratic values we work to protect."
"Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The world is watching Hong Kong, and Hong Kong is watching the floor of the House of Representatives. People by the tens of thousands in Hong Kong have demonstrated in favor of bills we are considering here today."
"In doing so, they have taken great risk to themselves and showed tremendous courage. The least we could do is pass these bills. I rise today to speak in favor of these bills on Hong Kong. I am proud to cosponsor all of the legislation under consideration dealing with Hong Kong."
"I want to first focus on a resolution I introduced with our colleagues, Mrs. Wagner; Mr. Connolly; and Mr. Yoho, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation, my partner on the Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation Subcommittee. This resolution demonstrates that the so-called extradition bill is an infringement on the rights of the people of Hong Kong, including their right to a high degree of autonomy, autonomy that was granted to Hong Kong when that city was returned to the control of Beijing. This resolution also establishes that the House of Representatives stands with Hong Kong protestors and supports their five major demands."
"These demands are:  Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill;  Universal suffrage in the election of the chief executive and all members of the Legislative Council;  The establishment of an independent commission to investigate the police's excessive use of force against the protestors;  The changing of the classification so these protests are not classified as riots and the participants are not classified as rioters; and, finally,  Having all charges against the people who participate in these protests dropped. Many of us in Congress and around the United States have been inspired by the people of Hong Kong standing up for their fundamental rights over the last few months. One of the protests brought nearly 25 percent of the entire population of Hong Kong into the streets. That is simply unprecedented."
"It would behoove Beijing to heed the protestors' demands. Sadly, instead of recognizing their own role in causing these protests, the Chinese Communist Party has tried to characterize the demonstrations as the handiwork of the United States. We categorically reject this assertion. These protests were motivated, first and foremost, in reaction to the effort by the People's Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party to interfere in the autonomy that was promised to the people of Hong Kong."
"These protests were motivated by the policies of Beijing and the Hong Kong government that have increasingly reduced the city's high degree of autonomy. The state-run media has even gone so far as to accuse a particular State Department official by name of orchestrating the protests. That is an insult to the people of Hong Kong, who speak for themselves and act for themselves."
"Moreover, it has put that diplomat and her family in danger. This is simply unacceptable behavior, and the Stand with Hong Kong Resolution criticizes this egregious action by the Chinese Government. Finally, let me reiterate my support for the other complementary bills that we are considering today on Hong Kong."
"The first is the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019, which was introduced by our colleague Mr. Smith, who will be managing time on the other side. This legislation will amend the Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 to account for the changes that have taken place over the last 25 years. The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act also conveys to Beijing that it cannot undermine the city's freedom while expecting America to still give that city preferential trade arrangements."
"I am also a strong supporter of Congressman Jim McGovern's PROTECT Hong Kong Act, which would restrict U.S. firms' ability to sell the Hong Kong police weapons to use against protestors. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho)."
"Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Mr. Smith and Mr. Sherman, whom I have the pleasure of serving with on the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation, for raising this important topic. I rise today to bring attention to three very important and timely measures that the House will consider this afternoon. These bipartisan measures passed out of the House Foreign Affairs Committee unanimously, and they include H. Res."
"543, by Representative Sherman; H.R. 3289, by Representative Smith; and H.R. 4270, by Representative McGovern. I am proud to say that I am a cosponsor of all three. Over the past 5 months, mass civilian protests in Hong Kong have begun to shed light on the deterioration of the Chinese Communist Party's influence outside of mainland China."
"Rising resentment in Hong Kong is not simply a result of the ill-fated extradition law championed by Chief Executive Carrie Lam, but the continued encroachment on freedom and liberties by President Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party. Despite the 1997 Sino-British agreement, leaders in Beijing continued their high-intensity political pressure campaign to subdue dissent within Hong Kong, which has emboldened the people of Hong Kong to stand up against Beijing, but more for freedom."
"This is illustrated by the people of Hong Kong raising and waving the American flag while burning the Chinese flag. The protestors now maintain five demands that Mr. Sherman already talked about: withdrawal of the extradition bill; drop charges against the protestors; launch an investigation into the police forces; and universal suffrage, which would allow voters to directly pick their leaders instead of hand-picked leaders of their chief executive by Beijing. As the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation, I have been extremely outspoken against the continued deterioration of rights and freedoms in Hong Kong. The passage of these important pieces of legislation will send a strong message to President Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party that these abuses will not be tolerated by the international community."
"Keep in mind that China and Great Britain signed this international agreement in 1997, where it stated that Hong Kong would be an autonomous region, self-ruled, and have an independent judiciary system. Only 22 years into it, Xi Jinping has said, as far as he is concerned, that agreement is null and void, and so you see the people of Hong Kong standing up in protest. Because they have experienced freedom and liberty, they are willing to risk their life. I just had a group of Hong Kong students come in. These are the people who are right in the forefront of the protests in Hong Kong, and they came to our office begging for help from the American people, from the American Government."
"Now, granted, Hong Kong, we all know, is a province of China. But we also know there was an agreement, for 50 years, it was to be autonomously ruled with an independent judiciary committee that Xi Jinping and the Communist Party of China have canceled, and I think this is a message for all people of the intent of what China is doing. We, as Members of Congress, have so much more that we represent. It is not a political body where we fight back and forth and discuss different things. What we represent here in America is what people around the world are willing to risk their life for and to stand up, in front of the face of adversity, to one of the emerging superpowers of the world and say: We do not accept your communist authority rule."
"We want you to honor liberty and freedom. See, the people of Hong Kong, they have experienced freedom and liberties. Xi Jinping and the Communist Party can't understand that because they have never experienced freedom or liberty. As supposedly the greatest deliberative body on the planet, this transcends way beyond what we do here. This is standing up for ideals that people around the world are willing to die for, and it is this body that can send a strong message to the Chinese Communist Party, to Xi Jinping that says we will not let liberties and freedom be taken away from people who have claimed that, who have known that all their life, and that that should be honored by those who are trying to take it apart. Before they want to take it apart, I suggest Xi Jinping and the Communist Party try freedom and liberty: Try democracy for a while; you might like it."
"I think these are three very important bills that should pass through this House unanimously and should pass through the Senate to show that we stand in solidarity with the folks, our friends in Hong Kong; and, if not, if we don't send a strong message, it will embolden China. I hope manufacturers and all businesses around the world that do business in Hong Kong are paying attention to this, because they are the ones that are creating a business environment that feeds China so that they can continue these terrible acts of suppression of liberties and freedoms. I hope the business community will say: You know what, we stand with the American people. It pains me when I see people like the NBA or other organizations, corporations that will bow down to China, and they do it for profit."
"It is time that we stand up not just as Americans, but people who are the bearers of liberty and freedom around the world that the rest of the world looks to. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."
"Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill). Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from New Jersey very much for allowing me to speak on the subject of Hong Kong today."
"I rise in support of all these bills before us today, particularly the bill from my friend from New Jersey, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, and I stand in solidarity with all freedom-loving people in Hong Kong. For more than 4 months, we have witnessed Hong Kong citizens peacefully protest for the right to live in a free and fair political system. Over my years, I have traveled to Hong Kong and witnessed their innovative spirit and work ethic."
"In fact, Hong Kong was the model for the post-World War II growth of the Asian Tigers in their prosperity and innovation. {time}  1545  In the 1980s, when a proponent of welfare statism queried pro-growth economist Melvyn B. Krauss:  ``But how many Hong Kongs can the world have?'' Dr. Krauss replied, ``As many as the world will allow itself.'' Freedom lovers should rally to that wisdom. This summer, I had the opportunity to hear directly from leaders in Hong Kong dedicated to religious tolerance and democracy as promised in the one country, two systems agreement."
"The people of Hong Kong continue to wave American flags during their protests as a symbol for the freedoms that they desire. Rather than receiving support from all over our great land here in this country, they have had to witness the blatant hypocrisy that we have seen from U.S. companies, including the National Basketball Association, more worried about the bottom line and retribution from the PRC, rather than standing up for the basic human rights that we are so blessed with in this country and that we advocate for as a part of our foreign policy all over this globe. The free world is looking to us for leadership, and that is why I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), Mr. McGovern, and Mr. Sherman for supporting these legislative efforts on a bipartisan basis, but more importantly, supporting the people in Hong Kong that they have the right to freedom of expression and democratic governance guaranteed under that 50-year arrangement agreed to in 1997 by both--by both, Mr. Speaker--the United Kingdom and the People's Republic of China. Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support these measures today, and I thank their sponsors."
"Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests fortime, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume, and I will close."
"Mr. Speaker, several years ago, I joined the then chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Royce, in visiting Hong Kong. We had a chance to spend a lot of time with both young and more experienced leaders fighting for democracy and autonomy for Hong Kong."
"And this has, in fact, been the policy of the United States since the 1992 Hong Kong Policy Act, which establishes our support for democratization as a fundamental principle of U.S. foreign policy. In recent days, we have seen demonstrators in Hong Kong asking the U.S. Congress to pass the three pieces of legislation that are before us. The protestors want to know if our support for democracy is merely rhetorical or if we are willing to take action to defend our principles. By passing these three bills today, we will affirm that the U.S. Congress supports democracy, human rights, and appropriate autonomy for Hong Kong."
"Mr. Speaker, as to all three bills, I want to thank Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Engel and many other colleagues for their leadership on this issue. Mr. Speaker, turning to the specifics of H. Res. 543, the specific matter before us at this moment, I want to thank my Foreign Affairs Committee colleagues for helping to introduce this measure, including Mrs. Wagner, Mr. Connolly, and Mr. Yoho, who spoke just a few minutes ago. 543 recognizes our country's strong relationship with the people of Hong Kong."
"It is an important measure of solidarity at a time when protesters are facing police brutality and China is trying to take away the autonomy that it promised. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res."
"543, a resolution ``Recognizing Hong Kong's bilateral relationship with the United States, condemning the interference of the People's Republic of China in Hong Kong's affairs, and supporting the people of Hong Kong's right to protest.'' As a senior member of the House Committee on the Judiciary, I support H. Res. 543 because it calls on the Hong Kong government to address the protesters' five demands, condemns police brutality against peaceful protesters, and condemns efforts to falsely accuse U.S. diplomats of fueling unrest. On June 30, 1997, China resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, ending more than 150 years of British colonial rule. Hong Kong is a customs territory and economic entity separate from the rest of China and is able to enter into international agreements on its own behalf in commercial, economic, and certain legal matters."
"U.S. policy toward Hong Kong is stated in the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 and grounded in the determination to promote Hong Kong's prosperity, autonomy, and way of life. The United States maintains substantial economic and political interests in Hong Kong. The U.S. supports Hong Kong's autonomy under the ``One Country, Two Systems'' framework by concluding and implementing bilateral agreements; promoting trade and investment; broadening law enforcement cooperation; bolstering educational, academic, and cultural links; supporting high-level visits of U.S. officials; and serving the large community of U.S. citizens and visitors."
"After 22 years, protests erupted over Carrie Lam's proposal to amend extradition laws to allow suspects to be transferred to mainland China for trial. A few days after proposing the amendment to the extradition laws, Carrie Lam suspended the proposal, but the protests in Hong Kong continue as the people of Hong Kong demand the high degree of autonomy promised by the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984."
"It is critical for the United States Congress to stand with the women and men advocating and speaking up for the autonomy and dignity of people of Hong Kong. I applaud the efforts and sacrifices pro-democracy activists have made and they should know that the United States fully supports their desire for freedom and peace, and strongly condemns the violent and oppressive tactics of the Hong Kong police."
"As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, I support the bilateral relationship between Hong Kong and the United States and the promotion of international peace. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Res. 543 to condemn the brutality faced by the people of Hong Kong and which poses a strong threat to the democratic values we work to protect."
"Madam President, on June 9, the streets of Hong Kong filled with over 1 million individuals peacefully protesting what they saw as an unjust law and attack on democracy. It was an incredible visual of people standing up for democracy and standing up for human rights. Here we are 5 months later, and the images are much different."
"You would be forgiven if you saw them and thought they were in a war zone. Hundreds of student protesters barricaded themselves in a Hong Kong university surrounded by armored riot police, pummeled by rubber bullets and tear gas, fires raging, destruction, devastation, and smoke everywhere. There have been 5 months of protests, rising anger, and tension. There have been 5 months of police crackdowns on peaceful protests, spurring further protests and resistance, and U.S.-made, U.S.-exported police equipment being misused by the Hong Kong police to violate the human rights of protesters."
"So far, over 10,000 rounds of tear gas have been fired into the crowds of protesters. We believe in free speech, freedom to assemble, freedom to protest, not state-sponsored oppression and violence. It is time to ban the export of U.S.-made police equipment to Hong Kong that is being used to abuse their human rights."
"That is why I am so pleased to introduce, in partnership with my colleague from Texas, S. 2710, which prohibits the export of munitions and crowd-control equipment to the Hong Kong Police Force. Since the protests in June, over 1,700 Hong Kong residents have been injured and over 5,000 have been arrested. Amnesty International verified incidents involving the dangerous use of U.S.-made pepper spray, batons used to beat protesters, rubber bullets, and tear gas. One young woman was clubbed from behind with a police baton and continued to be beaten even after she was on the ground with her arms zip-tied behind her."
"We have seen tear gas fired into confined spaces, in violation of the U.N. Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms. We have seen brutal police tactics that continued even when women and men were held in captivity or in custody. There has been report after report of violent assaults taking place inside police stations."
"We cannot turn a blind eye. It is time to stand with the people of Hong Kong who are demanding a democratic future and against the violent suppression of free speech. The bill the Senator from Texas and I have introduced lays out a series of products that we will no longer export to the Hong Kong Police Force: tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, foam and bean bag rounds, pepper balls, water cannons, handcuffs, shackles, stun guns, and tasers."
"This bill is backed by many colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I say a huge thank-you to Senator Markey, Senator Blackburn, Senator Leahy, Senator Scott, Senator Coons, Senator Wicker, Senator Blumenthal, Senator Inhofe, Senator Gillibrand, Senator Cardin, Senator Wyden, Senator Braun, Senator Gardner, and Senator Van Hollen. I am really proud to stand here in a bipartisan representation tonight, to stand with my colleagues who have introduced the Hong Kong Human Rights Democracy Act, and to stand together in a bipartisan fashion to ban the export of these brutal crowd-control strategies being misused in Hong Kong by their police to abuse the protesters."
"I turn to my colleague from Texas. The Senator from Texas. Madam President, for months, the world has watched as the brave citizens of Hong Kong have sustained protests against China's decades-long degradation of their civil liberties."
"The U.N. High Commissioner has found credible evidence of the Hong Kong Police Force using nonlethal crowd-control weapons in ways that violate international norms and standards. That is why I am proud to support the bipartisan PROTECT Hong Kong Act, as described by our colleague Senator Merkley. The PROTECT Hong Kong Act would direct the President to ban the issuance of licenses for commercial export of riot-control weapons like tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, stun guns, and tasers to the Hong Kong Police Force. This ensures that the Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters are not subjected to police brutality using products made in the United States of America."
"I am also proud to support the just-passed Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. I think the statement being made by the passage of these two pieces of legislation and the presence today of so many of our colleagues on a bipartisan basis standing with the people of Hong Kong against this oppression by their Communist overlords is very, very significant. Now more than ever, the United States must send a clear message toChina that the free world stands with Hongkongers in their struggle."
"I yield the floor. The Senator from New Jersey. Madam President, I want to take a moment to congratulate my colleague from Oregon and a distinguished member of the Foreign Relations Committee who has worked on this issue, alongside of Senator Cornyn, with great skill in a way that allowed the legislation we just passed to take place, which he strongly supports, and to make his legislation, along with Senator Cornyn, a reality shortly. He has been very adept about it and very constructive. It is going to be a great moment when we send a message that U.S. weaponry isn't going to be part of the oppression in Hong Kong."
"I salute him, and I join him in his effort."
"Mr. President, in a moment here, as my colleagues gather, we hope to pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. I first acknowledge all of the people who worked so hard on it--our staffs, obviously, and, in addition, Senators Cardin, Risch, Menendez, and over 50 cosponsors, many of whom will join us here this evening. I also thank Leaders McConnell and Schumer for their support in helping us get here."
"I thank Chairman Crapo, who has helped us make some important changes at the end that will make the sanctions easier to implement. A lot of people have been watching on the news the protests that have been going on in Hong Kong and are wondering as to, perhaps, the depths of what it is all about. When the United Kingdom handed Hong Kong over to China, they signed an agreement that is known as the Joint Declaration. It basically guarantees a high degree of autonomy and freedom of the people of Hong Kong."
"As a result of that agreement, the United States has treated commerce and trade with Hong Kong differently than it has its commercial and trade activity with the mainland of China. What has happened over the last few years is the steady effort, on the part of Chinese authorities, to erode that autonomy and those freedoms. The most recent protests really began with a proposal to pass an extradition law that would allow the Chinese Government to basically have arrested and extradite someone in Hong Kong over to the mainland."
"There was a huge pushback against that, and protests emerged as a result of it. Even though the Government of Hong Kong has pulled out from pursuing that law, the protests have continued because the people of Hong Kong have seen what is coming. They see the steady effort to erode their autonomy and their freedoms. The response by the Hong Kong authorities, with its having been under tremendous pressure from Beijing, has been that of violence and repression."
"So far, over 5,000 people have been arrested in Hong Kong. The youngest has been 12 years of age. The oldest has been 82. Hundreds more have been injured by violence committed by police authorities but also by street gangs--criminals, thugs--who have been empowered and encouraged by the Chinese authorities."
"This effort by China to exert control and remove autonomy continues unabated. Here are some examples. There was a law that was passed that banned wearing masks, and a Hong Kong court ruled that the ban was unconstitutional."
"The so-called National People's Congress in Beijing today ruled that Hong Kong courts have no authority--no power--to review Hong Kong Government legislation. Under pressure from Beijing, the Government of Hong Kong threatened to cancel the November 24 elections--elections, by the way, that China has been interfering in. China has pushed to ban critics, like Joshua Wong, from running."
"Seven candidates who are running have been attacked by street gangs during this campaign, and two candidates have been arrested while campaigning. And now for the latest move, China is pushing the Hong Kong Government to pass what they call the new national security law--a law that would allow them to arrest political critics and opponents. If this passes, if that happens, that is the very definition of control and de facto proof of all loss of autonomy."
"By the way, China is also pushing for something very ominous. They call it patriotic education. What China is really pushing for in Hong Kong is moving from ``one country, two systems'' to ``one country, one system''--the Chinese system. So the bill that we will bring up here in a moment, with tremendous bipartisan support, requires five quick things that I will touch on."
"First, its most important element is that it requires the Secretary of State to annually certify whether Hong Kong warrants being treated differently than China. If Hong Kong is no longer autonomous--and that is the rationale for different treatment--then, they should no longer receive that treatment. It says that students in Hong Kong shouldn't be barred from entering the United States or getting a visa to study here, for example, because they have been the subject of a politically motivated arrest or detention."
"It says that for the next 7 years, the Secretary of Commerce is going to report on whether export controls and sanction laws are being enforced by the Government of Hong Kong or whetherChina is using Hong Kong as a back door to evade export controls and sanctions. It says that if Hong Kong ultimately returns and passes that extradition bill that China wants, the President has to present a plan to protect Americans from this law. Last but not least, it mandates that the President identify and sanction foreigners the President determines, based on credible information, who are responsible for extraditions, for arbitrary detention, for torture, or for forced confessions inside of Hong Kong or any other human rights violations in Hong Kong. By the way, it would also allow blocking the assets of these persons if those assets are located here in the United States. So, in a moment here, as we continue to gather, we are waiting the arrival of companion legislation."
I yield the floor because I know we have lot of important sponsors that are here who want to speak on the subject. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. McSALLY).
"The Senator from Idaho. Madam President, first of all, this is an important step that we are taking here. This is a matter that we have been discussing for a long time. There has been a lot of action on it, and I want to thank Senator Rubio and Senator Cardin, who are the lead supporters of this bill and who have, on behalf of the committee, done yeoman's work getting it together and getting the bipartisan compromise to get the language here."
"Also, virtually all members of the committee have had fingerprints on this bill, and so in that regard, I think it is going to pass quite handily. I want to thank the Banking staff, particularly my colleague from Idaho, Senator Crapo, who, of course, has the expertise--the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee--on these kinds of things on sanctions. They were very helpful in hammering out the language that we needed for the sanctions. I want to thank the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee staff, who were helpful. I want to thank the staff of the Foreign Relations Committee, who work for us--both the minority staff, Senator Menendez's staff, and my staff, the majority staff--for doing this and all of the people who worked on this."
"So thank you to all of you. Since June, millions of people in Hong Kong have taken to the streets protesting the erosion of their rights and freedoms. Hong Kong was supposed to maintain a high degree of autonomy after China regained sovereignty over the territory in 1997. This wasn't just a verbal understanding. This was in the treaty that China signed with Great Britain."
"However, since that time, China has gradually chipped away at Hong Kong's autonomy, and this is now becoming a real problem. China now refers to its treaty with Great Britain as ``a historical document,'' and says it is no longer bound by its terms. This is just one of many examples that show that the Chinese Government has no respect for the rule of law. After two decades of broken commitments, it is past time that we hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable. What it is doing in Hong Kong is just wrong. That is why I am proud to join Senator Rubio and Senator Cardin and all the others who have had hands on this bill in bringing the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act to the Senate floor."
"This bill is the result of a strong, strong bipartisan consensus that we must act in support of the Hong Kong people. Thank you all for helping. We will get to the unanimous consent here in a little bit. I yield the floor to Senator Cardin."
"The Senator from Maryland. Madam President, let me first thank Senator Rubio for his leadership on this issue and Senator Menendez and Senator Risch for their leadership in our committee and so many others who have been involved, because tonight we have a chance to reaffirm our commitment for human rights and democracy."
"That is exactly what our legislation does. It recognizes the fact that for 24 consecutive weeks, the people of Hong Kong have been asking for their basic democracy and freedom. On Monday, it was reported--just yesterday--that police fired 1,458 rounds of tear gas, 1,391 rubber bullets, 325 beanbag rounds, and 265 sponge grenades--that is just yesterday--on peaceful protesters. They are asking nothing more than to exercise the rights they were told would be protected to express their views and to be able to have democracy in Hong Kong, which is the way it was in the previous time."
"Senator Rubio and I introduced legislation, and the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Risch and Menendez, joined us, and we passed this bipartisan legislation on June 13. It reaffirms the principles set forth in the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, which supports democratization, human rights, and the autonomy of Hong Kong. Now, Senator Rubio already talked about this, but this is a very important thing."
"We gave Hong Kong a special status in its relationship with the United States that China does not enjoy, and we gave them that special status upon their protecting democracy and human rights in Hong Kong. That was the commitment. If they don't comply with that, this special status should no longer be available, and this legislation requires that we get information on a regular basis as to whether China is respecting the rights that we put in our legislation in 1992, that they notify us on a regular timeframe. That is an important point, because if they don't, we shouldn't give them that protected status. Secondly, it identifies persons who suppress basic freedoms, similar to the Magnitsky Act sanctions."
"Those that are taking away the human rights of the people of Hong Kong would be subject to the same type of visa restrictions to visit America and to use our banking system. That makes a great deal of sense, and we know that is pretty effective. So it is time that we back up our words and our commitment to supporting Hong Kong's democratization, human rights, and autonomy with action. Let's make sure the people of Hong Kong know that the U.S. Congress and the American people stand in solidarity with them, as the Chinese authorities, as we speak, are repressing the legitimate rights of the people of Hong Kong."
We can stand with the people of Hong Kong for democracy and human rights by our actions this evening. I yield the floor. The Senator from New Jersey.
"Madam President, I rise in support of the motion that shortly will be made by our colleague, the Senator from Florida. I want to congratulate Senator Cardin and him for their leadership in this regard."
"I appreciate the chairman and myself having joined them and moving this expeditiously through the committee, and I am looking forward to its critical passage on the floor. Time is of the essence. The people of Hong Kong are fighting for their lives. Six months ago, millions of Hong Kong citizens took to the streets to peacefully protest the erosion of their democracy and their rights."
"Now, half a year later, we find mounting anger and unrest, with the violence against students and protesters--most dramatically, in the crackdown on Hong Kong Polytechnic University--only getting worse. People are being shot. Universities are being burned. The violence perpetrated by the authorities in Hong Kong and, by extension, Beijing are turning the city into a battlefield."
"This is not the Hong Kong that any of us want to see. The special character of Hong Kong is one of the world's great success stories. The vibrancy of the people of Hong Kong, especially its young people and the rising generation of leaders standing up for democracy and self-governance, should inspire all of us."
"We admire Hong Kong's success as a burgeoning economic powerhouse, and we admire the vibrant and autonomous civil society and civic life that has flourished under the ``one country, two systems'' principle. Hong Kong is one of the remarkable success stories of the Indo-Pacific--oneof the most remarkable success stories of China and the Chinese people--and it is a success worth protecting. I call on the police to act professionally and to treat its fellow citizens with respect and restraint. We call for Beijing and the Hong Kong authorities to address the noble and legitimate aspirations of the people of Hong Kong. In these turbulent times, the Congress of the United States must lead with our values."
"We must stand on the side of freedom and human dignity, and we must send a clear and uncompromising statement that America stands with the people of Hong Kong in their quest to maintain their self-governance and autonomy, to safeguard their human rights, to exercise their democratic freedom, and to determine their own future. The House of Representatives already passed their version of this bill, and the situation in Hong Kong grows more tenuous by the day. That is why the United States should and must act today."
"I look forward to the passage of this bill without delay. Let us work to hold China accountable for the erosion of democracy in Hong Kong, and let us together send a message to the people of Hong Kong that their cries for democracy and freedom have been heard through both Chambers of the U.S. Congress, and that America stands with them in their call for justice and self-determination."
I yield the floor. The Senator from Arkansas.
"Madam President, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act is really about promises--making promises and keeping promises. Unfortunately, the Chinese Communist Party has a long history of making promises but not keeping them. You can ask a rice farmer from Stuttgart. You can ask a software programmer from Fayetteville, a factory worker from Fort Smith, or a Christian missionary from Searcy. In this case, China promised in 1984 that it would uphold the ``one country, two systems'' approach to Hong Kong when it took over in 1997, a promise to preserve the freedoms that have made Hong Kong distinctive--the freedom to practice one's religion as one sees fit, to speak one's mind, and to participate in the political process."
"But that is just another promise they are on the verge of breaking. Apparently, the ``one country, two systems'' approach can't satisfy Beijing's rapacious appetite. They look at and covet Hong Kong's wealth, and they fear and loathe its freedom, which stands in shining contrast to the Orwellian oppression on the mainland."
"In fact, they fear that mainland Chinese might look across the bay and start to get ideas. So the Chinese Communist Party has been breaking its promises to Hong Kong and to the world, waging a brutal campaign to absorb Hong Kong into its dystopian, high-tech dictatorship. Hongkongers are bravely resisting in the face of this kind of escalating violence. In recent days, Hong Kong security forces have shot a protestor in the stomach."
"They have trapped hundreds of students in the university, using rubber bullets and tear gas on them. They have threatened them with mass arrest. Beijing's propagandists have been hinting that even harsher measures are on the way. An article in the party-controlled China Daily argues that Beijing must accelerate Hong Kong's integration with the mainland and then reeducate Hongkongers, just like they are doing on a mass scale to 1 million Uighurs in concentration camps in Xinjiang."
"I said this in the summer when the protests started. Let me say it again. It would be a grave mistake of historic proportion--surpassing the massacre of Tiananmen Square--if Beijing were to impose martial law, occupy, or otherwise crackdown on Hong Kong. But the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act is about more than China making and breaking promises. It is also about the United States finally enforcing China's promises."
"We have a shot to avert catastrophe, protect the people of Hong Kong, and to finally enforce Beijing promises or hold them accountable for breaking those promises. Very soon, the Senate will pass this legislation on a unanimous, bipartisan basis to give you a sense of sentiment in the Congress. This legislation requires the Secretary of State to certify Hong Kong's autonomy from the mainland each year."
"Otherwise, they will lose the special privileges that U.S. law currently grants to Hong Kong. The bill will freeze the assets and travel of officials who are responsible for abducting Hongkongers, like journalists, booksellers who have been vanishing without a trace since 2017, and it will ensure that pro-democracy protesters cannot be denied visas to the United States despite their specious arrests. But if the Hong Kong Chinese Communist Party will simply pull back from the brink, if they will keep their promises, if they will respect their one-country, two-system approach, none of this will happen."
"So Beijing has a promise. Keep its promises, or give Americans and the world one more reason to treat China like an outlaw regime."
"Choose wisely, Mr. General Secretary Xi. The Senator from Illinois. Madam President, I want to thank my colleagues, Senators Rubio, Cardin, Menendez, and Representative Chris Smith for moving the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act in both Chambers, legislation I was proud to cosponsor. With the situation deteriorating by the hour in Hong Kong, the passage of legislation could not be more timely. I urge my colleagues in the House to take action quickly without delay."
"This bill sends an important message of bipartisan support from the U.S. Congress for the democratic aspirations of the broad majority of the people of Hong Kong. Some of you may realize that we, just a few months ago, celebrated the 30th anniversary of the bloody crackdown that ended the peaceful democracy movement in Tiananmen Square. Who among us can forget those riveting weeks during which there was real hope and possibility of China opening its political system--the Goddess of Democracy statue modeled after our own Statue of Liberty--and, sadly, the jarring image of the protestor that was standing to try to block the onslaught of a tank?"
"The crude propaganda and disinformation used by Communist hardliners to brainwash young military conscripts to turn on their own people was both heartbreaking and infuriating. Remembering those days, we must not sit by idly and quietly and allow Hong Kong's freedoms to be similarly threatened. I have been moved by the courageousness of the pro-democracy protestors in the face of increasingly excessive use of force by the Hong Kong police in one of the most vibrant cities in the world."
"What exactly are Hong Kong protesters fighting for--the freedoms we in America take for granted every day--the freedom of assembly, suffrage, speech, due process, and rule of law. Rather than sitting down with the protesters, Hong Kong authorities have increasingly used excessive force instead of engaging in constructive dialogue. Yet, ultimately, I believe the Hong Kong Government and the protesters are capable of finding a solution, and I hope they do."
"Let me end by appealing to the leadership in China to show the courage to allow the continued prosperous democratic autonomy enjoyed by the people of Hong Kong. Hong Kong's continued special status is the sign of strength and confidence, not weakness."
I yield the floor. The Senator from Florida.
"Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam President, I rise today to speak about the greatest threat the United States faces in the next century, the threat of Communist China. I have been saying, for months, Communist China is not our friend. They are stealing our technology; refusing to open up their markets to foreign goods as required by the WTO; militarizing the South China Sea, even after promising President Obama they wouldn't; holding over 1 million Uighurs in prison camps just for their religion; harvesting the organs of detainees against their will; and Communist China is intentionally pushing fentanyl into the United States, killing Americans every day."
Communist China continues to strip the people of Hong Kong of their basic rights. I was the first Senator to visitHong Kong since the protests started nearly 6 months ago.
"I had the opportunity to meet with the protestors--students, parents, and grandparents--who are fighting to regain the freedom they were once promised. I heard their stories, horrible and frightening stories of police brutality, threats against individuals and their families, and mysterious disappearances. Six months in and no signs of Communist China loosening their grip--their efforts to crack down on the protests in Hong Kong reflect their commitment to denying basic human rights and snuffing out any opposition to their totalitarian goals. We cannot stay silent."
"General Secretary of the Communist Party Xi is trying to be the dominant world power. It is Hong Kong now, then it will be Taiwan."
"Communist China believes that, in order for them to be stronger, other freedom-loving countries must be weaker. As Communist China becomes more and more aggressive, we must ask ourselves: Is this the next Tiananmen Square? We all remember that famous image."
"Times have changed, but one thing stays the same: Wherever totalitarian regimes exist, there will be brave freedom fighters who will stand up against injustice and stand for human rights. That is what we are seeing in Hong Kong today. Beijing soldiers have been appearing on the city streets, raising questions about the army's future role. Will Communist China once again use its military might to quash peaceful protests?"
"Will they once again stand against those fighting for human rights and democracy? Will the United States stand by and allow this to happen? We are seeing Americans like Michael Bloomberg putting profits above human rights and propping up the Chinese Government by continuing to host huge events in Communist China. It is time for the world to stand and present a unified front against Communist China's aggression, and that starts with supporting the brave people of Hong Kong."
"We must do everything we can to communicate our commitment to democracy, freedom, and human rights. I am proud to stand in support of the Hong Kong Freedom and Democracy Act, which will give the United States more authority to reevaluate Beijing's influence on Hong Kong."
"This bill makes it clear that General Secretary of the Communist Party Xi needs to comply with what China agreed to in 1997. Communist China must give Hong Kong its autonomy, or the United States will continue to ramp up pressure on Communist China. We cannot underestimate this threat."
We must be vigilant. We must be aggressive. America's role of fighting for freedom and liberty worldwide depends on it. The future of our children and grandchildren depends on it.
"To the brave and resilient people of Hong Kong, the United States is with you. Your fight will not be in vain, and it does not go unnoticed. And to Communist China and General Secretary of the Communist Party Xi, consider your next moves carefully."
The world is watching. I won't stop fighting until America's economic and political future--and the freedom of nations across the globe--is secure from the threat of China's influence. I want to thank Senator Rubio and Senator Cardin and all Senators of the U.S. for their support of this bill. I yield the floor.
"The Senator from Missouri. Madam President, just two brief points this evening--the first is that I am proud to join not only as a supporter of this measure but as original cosponsor, and I want to thank the other Senators--Senator Rubio, especially Senator Cardin, and Senator Risch--for their leadership on this issue, but I want to be clear that we are here today in this Chamber, and what we are doing is possible tonight because of the bravery and the courage of the protesters in Hong Kong."
"Many of them are very young people who are risking their very lives, taking to the streets, standing for democracy, standing for the promises that were made to them by Beijing many years ago and fighting for them now, putting everything on the line. And I just want to say to those protesters that you are making a difference, that your lives have made a difference, and to those who even now are trapped inside PolyU in this siege that the Hong Kong police force has created--this humanitarian crisis that the Hong Kong police force has fostered--what you are doing is inspiring the world. What you are doing has moved this body."
What you are doing is changing the world. Thank you for your courage.
"Thank you for your bravery. Thank you for believing in your city, and thank you for believing in Hong Kong. The other thing I would say is that, while today is a good day in the struggle to preserve the freedoms of this city and the struggle against a totalitarian regime in Beijing, it is not the last day. Although this step is an important step that this Chamber takes, it is not the last step that this Nation may need to take in order to hold China to its commitments made in 1984, in order to protect the autonomy and the liberty of the city of Hong Kong because, make no mistake, we are in for a long struggle with Communist China."
"We are in for a long struggle with Beijing. We know what their ambitions are: to dominate Hong Kong, to dominate Taiwan, to dominate the region and, ultimately, to impose their will on the entire international system. We are going to have to stand against that for freedom, for liberty, for our security and our prosperity."
"So there is much to do. There is a long road ahead of us, but today is a good day, and I hope the people of Hong Kong will see that the people of the free world are awake, that they are with you, and we are ready to stand together. I yield the floor. The Senator from Tennessee."
"Madam President, I want to thank Senator Rubio for the work that he has done on this a few minutes earlier. Today, I spoke about the cause of freedom and how we are seeing people around the world stand up for freedom--and, yes, indeed, we see this in Hong Kong, and it does inspire us. The message that we are sending to Beijing is that, indeed, we are watching and we are paying attention--and to the Hong Kong protesters, for them to know that we are watching what they are doing and that we are standing with them. It is important to note that China has really earned its place atop the list of the world's most notorious human rights violators, and over the past few weeks, Hong Kong's descent into chaos and bloodshed has provided a much-needed reminder of the horrors, the absolute horrors of authoritarian rule. There can be no change without accountability, and Beijing needs to know we are focused on that accountability, which is why, today, I am so pleased to stand with these other Members of this Chamber in support of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act."
"The bill does demand accountability, not only from Beijing but also from us. It will require us to monitor Hong Kong's progress toward autonomy and China's behavior toward Hong Kong people who choose to exercise their internationally recognized rights, those rights that we have spoken of in this Chamber today. The bill will help us identify the tactics Beijing uses to capture Hong Kong's dissidents and then to trap them on mainland China, and we will also ensure that no peaceful protesters are denied visas to the United States because of the alleged crimes."
"Now, I will tell you, the bill is a great start, but the time and the work that we put in it will be wasted unless every single Member of this Chamber makes a commitment to hold us accountable, to hold China accountable. I would encourage my colleagues to view their support of this legislation as a promise to these protesters in Hong Kong, that their cries for help are not going to go unanswered. I yield the floor."
"The Senator from Texas. Madam President, today, brave men and women, boys and girls, are standing up and demanding that the Chinese Communist Party protect Hong Kong's autonomy, protect free speech, and defend human rights."
"Despite these peaceful protests, the Chinese Communist Party is fighting back with brutality and violence. The police brutality that we have seen and the Chinese Communist Party's larger assault on the people of Hong Kong hasbeen shameful. Just this past weekend, the Hong Kong police began attacking young, innocent students who were peacefully protesting that brutality. They were attacked with tear gas and rubber bullets."
"These students' college campus was turned into a warzone, where no one was safe. Today, we have the opportunity to tell the world, these blatant human rights attacks and this campaign to bully Hong Kong into submission are not OK and America won't stand for it. Last month, I traveled to Hong Kong."
"I met with many brave men and women who were standing up. I met with the dissidents, the pro-democracy protesters who are speaking out for Hong Kong's autonomy and free speech and basic human rights. Along with them, I dressed in all black to express my solidarity with the peaceful protestors who have taken to the streets. Right now, in response to that protest, tear gas, sponge grenades, rubber bullets are being fired at university campuses in Hong Kong."
"In Xinjiang Province, millions of detained Uighurs and other religious minorities are languishing in concentration camps, and across China, Falun Gong practitioners are captured and murdered so that the Communist Party can harvest their organs. Freedom from this brutality and the tyranny of the Chinese Communist Party is the battle cry of the dissidents in Hong Kong. What have they been waving?"
"What have they been singing? The American National Anthem--reciting quotations from our Founding Fathers who risked everything for freedom in America. Madam President, I want to thank Senators Rubio, Cardin, Risch, Menendez, and all the members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, both Republicans and Democrats who have joined together."
"This legislation the Senate is preparing to pass, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, is important legislation. It is bipartisan legislation. I urge the House to take it up and pass it and pass it promptly. The people in Hong Kong are engaged in an existential battle for liberty, and they should know and they will know, by our actions in just a few moments, that the people of America stand with Hong Kong. I yield the floor."
"Madam President, I sincerely thank my colleagues. This has been a great bipartisan moment on the floor of the Senate for a very important issue."
"I particularly thank my colleagues from Florida, Senator Rubio; from Maryland, Senator Cardin; from New Jersey, Senator Menendez; and from Idaho, Senator Risch, as well as all the others who had a hand in this work. The Senate has just sent a resounding message to the Chinese Communist Party and President Xi that the United States stands with the democratic protestors in Hong Kong. The bipartisan legislation, with the great help of the chair and ranking members of the Foreign Relations Committee, will safeguard Hong Kong's democracy and autonomy and hold accountable those responsible for any human rights abuses in Hong Kong."
"The bipartisan legislation that will soon be offered by the Senators from Oregon and Texas will make sure that U.S. companies don't sell riot equipment to Hong Kong. We have sent a message to President Xi: Your suppression of freedom, whether in Hong Kong, in northwest China, or anywhere else, will not stand."
"You cannot be a great leader and you cannot be a great country when you oppose freedom, when you are so brutal to the people of Hong Kong, young and old, who are protesting, when you are so brutal to the Uighurs in northwest China, and when China is censored so that Chinese people can't get the truth. History has shown that that always fails, President Xi--always fails. China has taken dramatic steps backward in the curtailment of freedom."
"As my colleagues well know, the protests in Hong Kong have now taken an ominous turn. The Hong Kong police--no doubt at the behest of the Communist Party in Beijing--have undertaken an increasingly violent crackdown on student protesters. As the ruling party in Beijing continues to flout Hong Kong's judicial independence while perpetrating a brutal suppression of minority groups from one end of China to the other, Americans' support for the democratic rights of Hong Kong citizenry is paramount."
"To the people of China: We stand with you in freedom. To the kids in Hong Kong, the students and the adults: We stand with you. To the Uighurs who simply want to practice their religion: We stand with you."
"Freedom will prevail, and the Chinese system will either change or fail."
"Mr. President, yesterday the U.S. Senate spoke up forcefully and clearly for the brave people of Hong Kong. We unanimously passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. As the author of the original United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, and somebody who has advocated for Hongkongers for decades, I was proud to speak out on this back in the summer when the protests began."
"I was also proud to secure important policy steps for Hong Kong in the Senate Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs back in September. I am also proud that Senators approved these further steps to update the original law to preserve Hong Kong's autonomy and democracy and provide more tools for holding Beijing accountable. I want to thank the senior Senator from Florida, all the other Members who led on this issue, and all of our colleagues for securing unanimous passage. While this bill moves forward, it is also important for the executive branch and our allies and partners around the world to fulfill their roles as well."
"Even before this new bill becomes law, Congress has already given the administration significant powers to act, including authorities to directly sanction individuals who violate human rights. I urge every trading nation around the world to look clearly at Hong Kong and at Xinjiang and imagine the costs as China continues to entrench its surveillance state and export it all around the world. The Senate continues to do our part."
Everyone else must do theirs as well. The United States and the world must stand with Hong Kong.
"Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to start by thanking Mr. Smith for authoring the measure before us. The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act is a bill to advance our support for the people of Hong Kong."
"This bill updates the longstanding U.S. policy on Hong Kong so as to reflect what is happening on the ground today. The foundation of our relationship with Hong Kong was laid back in 1992 when Congress passed the Hong Kong Policy Act. That is where we got the one country, two systems approach that paved the way for our strong partnership with Hong Kong. But we are watching now the Chinese Communist Party trying to break down that system, trying to strip Hong Kong's autonomy and bring it under full control of the government of the mainland."
"This has motivated millions of Hong Kongers to take to the streets and protest in defense of their rights. To support them, we need to make sure that our policy is brought up to date so it can match the challenges of the U.S.-Hong Kong relationship today. The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act does just that."
It makes clear that the United States will stand up for Hong Kong's autonomy and democratic aspirations of its people. It beefs up reporting so that we can track any efforts by China to interfere in Hong Kong's affairs and to use Hong Kong to avoid U.S. export controls. It slaps sanctions on anyone responsible for undermining Hong Kong's autonomy or violating Hong Kongers' humans rights. This bill sends a strong message to China that the United States stands with the people of Hong Kong.
"Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank so many people for working so hard on this piece of legislation: my good friend,  Jim McGovern, the principal cosponsor and just a great friend, on fighting tyranny in China."
"He chairs the China Commission. I am the ranking member. Previously, I have chaired it, and so we have gone back and forth in working that leadership."
"I want to thank him especially for that. Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank, of course, Chairman Engel and Ranking Member McCaul, Chairman Sherman and Ranking Member Yoho for their strong support for this bipartisan legislation. Mr. Speaker, there are a number of staffers who I will speak about in a moment."
"I will do it now: Scott Flipse for his great work on this bill, it is landmark work going back to 5 years ago; Jon Stivers; Reva Price from the Speaker's office, who has been tenacious on this legislation; Jennifer Hendrixson-White; Bryan Burack; Janice Kaguyutan; Theresa Lou; Darrow Godeski Merton; Doug Anderson; Piero Tozzi; Sabrina Tsai. Just so many very good people who have all pulled together in a bipartisan way to make sure that this legislation comes to the floor and becomes law. Mr. Speaker, since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre 30 years ago, I have had the privilege of working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle, including Speaker Pelosi, on human rights, the rule of law and democracy for the People's Republic of China."
"Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank Kevin McCarthy, the minority leader here in the House, the Republican leader, who has put me on as his selection on the China Commission and for his strong support for this legislation as well. We have always believed, Mr. Speaker, that every person in China deserves better than the brutality so many endure every single day and the systematic violations of their universally-recognized human rights. Tragically, under President Xi Jinping, human rights abuses throughout China have significantly worsened, including the pervasive use of torture, religious persecution, and human trafficking. Solemn promises made by Beijing are rarely kept, and far too many leaders of the free world are far too eager to blindly accept fiction over fact."
"Broken promises are the rule, not the exception under Xi Jinping, and the people of Hong Kong are suffering because of it. During the 2014 Umbrella Movement, the world saw the courageous people of Hong Kong demanding that Beijing not renege on promises made to ensure universal suffrage, basic rights, and authentic elections in 2017. Despite President Xi Jinping's brutal crackdown on protesters then and now, triggered this time by an outrageous proposed policy to facilitate extradition, the resolve, the courage, the tenacity, and clarity of purpose of the people of Hong Kong shines through the darkness like the Sun."
"Two days ago, Reuters reported that President Xi Jinping told leaders in Nepal, ``Anyone attempting to split China in any part of the country will end in crushed bodies and shattered bones.'' President Xi's government excels in crushing bodies, shattering bones, torturing dissidents, and filling concentration camps, massive crimes against humanity, for which there has been little or no accountability or sanctioning. But today, Mr. Speaker, we are simply urging the Chinese President and the Hong Kong Chief Executive--and we have that obligation under our own laws--to faithfully honor the government's promises. Honor the promises made in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration that facilitated the conveyance of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to China beginning on July 1, 1997, that autonomy, human rights, including press, assembly, association, and religion, would be exactly the same as before the handover for at least 50 years. Honor the promises made in the ``Basic Law'' of Hong Kong adopted by China's National People's Congress in 1990, before the giveback of Hong Kong, that autonomy and rights would be protected."
"Even before the latest round of protests, Mr. Speaker, the U.S. State Department has noted that rights and liberties in Hong Kong have diminished. They are not living up to their solemn promises made in order for the Hong Kong conveyance to occur."
"You know, the great young leader, Joshua Wong, reminded us that a fourth of the population of Hong Kong, about 2 million people, turned out for one of the peaceful protests. Mr. Speaker, where has that ever happened? Five years ago, Mr. Speaker, in 2014, joined by Mrs. Pelosi, I introduced the bipartisan Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. We did it again in 2015, in 2017, and again this year, again, with my good friend from Massachusetts."
"Our new bill, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, is a blueprint for meaningful action. Specifically, the act directs the Secretary of State to certify to Congress annually whether Hong Kong continues to deserve special treatment under U.S. law different from mainland China in such matters as trade, customs, sanctions enforcement, law enforcement cooperation, and protection of human rights and the rule of law. It encourages the State Department not to deny visas based on an applicant's arrest or detention for participating in nonviolent activities in Hong Kong. It requires an annual report from the Commerce Department on whether the Hong Kong Government adequately enforces U.S. export controls and sanctions laws, including on those goods and services transshipped to North Korea, Iran, or other countries relating to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, violations of human rights, narcotics trafficking, and more. {time}  1600  It requires an assessment of whether U.S. origin items, including software, technology, and services, have been transferred from Hong Kong to China in violation of U.S. law and have been used by China for mass surveillance, predictive policing, or for the social credit system."
"Now, some people might ask: What is this social credit system? Mr. Speaker, it is a ubiquitous, totalitarian ``brave new world'' system scheduled for implementation by 2020 that will use public records, online activities, and other tools of surveillance to aggregate data on every single, solitary Chinese citizen and business and use that data to monitor, shape, and rate financial, social, religious, or political behaviors. It requires the Secretary of State to submit a strategy to Congress to protect U.S. citizens and businesses in Hong Kong from the erosion of autonomy and the rule of law because of actions taken by the Chinese Communist governments. It requires the President to identify and sanction persons in Hong Kong or in mainland China responsible for the erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy and serious abuses of human rights. It tracks the Magnitsky Act, which Mr. McGovern and I worked so hard to enact into law, so that we deny visas and also deny the ability to do business here to the people who are responsible for these egregious abuses."
"And it requires a waiver provision that helps ensure that our actions protect the great people of Hong Kong and enhance the autonomy rather than inadvertently harming it. So it gives real flexibility to the President and to the State Department to make the right call. Finally, Mr. Speaker, I have heard it said that the business of Hong Kong is business. But it is also clear to me, now, that the business of Hong Kong is freedom and democracy. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I join with the gentleman from New Jersey in praising the staff members who helped create these bills, not only the one under consideration, but the other two that deal with Hong Kong."
"Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), a great champion for human rights. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3289, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Chris Smith for his incredible leadership in introducing this bipartisan legislation and for all of his work on human rights."
"I also thank Chairman Engel and Ranking Member McCaul, as well as Chairman Sherman, for their leadership and their support of this bill and bringing it before the House today for consideration. Behind me is a photograph taken on Monday night in Hong Kong's Chater Garden."
"It is estimated that 130,000 people took part in this rally calling on the United States Congress to pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. The Hong Kong people need international support, and I am proud that the United States House of Representatives is standing in solidarity with Hong Kong in their struggle. While the protests were sparked by the extradition bill, the heart of the discontent is that many of Hong Kong's political leaders do not represent the people. Instead, Hong Kong's leaders are beholden to the Chinese Government."
"Millions of Hong Kongers would not have to protest in the streets if they could freely choose their political leaders. Since the 2014 umbrella movement protests, the ``one country, two systems'' framework has been rapidly eroding as free expression has been stifled and the space for democratic participation has been restricted. We have seen the prosecution and sentencing of prodemocracy leaders, the disqualification and removal of prodemocracy legislators, the abduction and arbitrary detention of booksellers, and the expelling of a Financial Times journalist."
"Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy is enshrined in the legally binding 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and Hong Kong's Basic Law. The joint declaration is an international treaty, signed by the Chinese Government, and guarantees the protection of rights and a separate economic system for mainland China. I believe it is time for the United States to reconsider its policies toward Hong Kong. U.S.-Hong Kong relations are governed by the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 that commits the United States to treating Hong Kong as a separate customs territory from the rest of China as long as Hong Kong remains sufficiently autonomous. The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act would require the Secretary of State to certify, on an annual basis, whether Hong Kong continues to warrant special treatment different from mainland China under U.S. law."
"It is time we put the Chinese Government on annual notice that further erosion of autonomy or a crackdown will cause the city, which serves as an important financial haven for wealthy Chinese elites, to lose its special economic, financial, and trade arrangement with the United States. Further, the legislation authorizes sanctions against individuals who violate human rights and states that Hong Kong visa applicants should not be denied entry to the United States based on politically motivated arrests based on their protest activities. To be clear, we stand together with the people of Hong Kong and, indeed, all the people of China when we express our concerns about the human rights violations of the Hong Kong and Chinese Governments. Over the years, Hong Kong has prospered and become the financial center of Asia because of its strong commitment to the rule of law, good governance, human rights, and open economic system."
"We must use our leverage to help the people of Hong Kong in their struggle to secure a democratic future that protects Hong Kong's autonomy and way of life. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this legislation, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey."
"Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers on this side, so I yield myself such time as I may consume for the purpose of closing."
"Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Smith for introducing this legislation. Thirty years since Tiananmen Square and Chinese authorities are still turning to violence and intimidation to crush dissent and attack basic freedoms. With this important legislation, we send a clear signal that the United States stands with the people of Hong Kong. Mr. Speaker, I hope all Members will join me in supporting the passage of this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today in defense of liberal democratic values and in solidarity with the people of Hong Kong. Earlier this week, the House passed legislation in support of these values and of human rights. A strong nation is one that does not turn to its worst instincts in the face of dissent."
"A strong nation does not see liberal democratic values as a threat. A strong nation tolerates differences in pursuit of prosperity for itself and prosperity for the world. To my fellow Americans, I say that we must not turn our backs on our principles in exchange for profit; we must not trade away our freedoms or be indifferent to those who yearn to be free. To the 2 million courageous young people in Hong Kong who marched, to those who are willing to fight for a prosperous future where their rights will be respected and where their freedoms will be protected: We are with you."
"Madam President, on one final matter, in recent weeks, I have spoken about our Nation's renewed competition with other great powers, like Russia and China. Despite decades of efforts to welcome these nations into a peaceful, prosperous, and fair international system, we are constantly reminded that these nations have their own design on the future. In their visions, foundational principles of sovereignty, freedom, human rights, and a rules-based international order tend to take a backseat to power politics and the pursuit of hegemony."
"The Chinese Communist Party, for example, is working to extend its control and influence everywhere from Taiwan to Cambodia, to Laos, to Burma, to Hong Kong, as we have seen recently. The tools and tactics may differ but the goal is the same: Beijing wants to bend its neighbors to its will. Earlier this month, after historic protests, Hong Kong's Government hit pause on legislation that would have further eroded its autonomy and invited more meddling from the mainland, but victory for freedom and autonomy is not yet assured. The bill in question has been suspended, but it hasn't been totally withdrawn."
"Hong Kong's people, emboldened by this rare victory over Beijing's creeping influence, have continued to exercise their freedom of assembly to reclaim the rights, privileges, and autonomy slowly sliced away in recent years by the PRC. Protests continue and with them countervailing pressures from authorities beholden to Beijing. Increasingly brutal police tactics and pro-mainland vigilantes are drawing blood in an effort to intimidate Hongkongers back into submission."
"Hong Kong's autonomous governance, political freedoms, and stable rule of law has been a crucial precondition of its tremendous growth and prosperity. U.S. firms have invested tens of billions in Hong Kong's economy because they trust the autonomous region's political climate, independent judicial system, and degree of independence from Beijing. By contrast, international firms are currently pulling back from China due to concerns about corruption, autocracy, intellectual property rights violations, and state-sponsored corporate espionage. At a time when China faces slowing growth, Beijing should seek to emulate Hong Kong, not engulf Hong Kong and remake it in the image of the Chinese Communist Party."
"The PRC has long been working hard under the surface to increase its influence and power. In Hong Kong, like in so many other areas, China has used this approach that experts have called ``hide and bide''--hiding their intentions and biding their time, slowly slicing away resistance, building leverage, and encroaching, one step at a time. In the case of Hong Kong, Beijing and its agents have overreached, but they are recalculating--postponing action on this legislation while biding time to resume the encroachment. This is not just a matter of the people of Hong Kong."
"The PRC's treatment of Hong Kong--just like its treatment of the Uighurs or Tibetans that Beijing claims as citizens--is an indicator of how Chinese rulers will behave abroad. All nations who trade with the PRC should be watching the drama unfolding on the streets of Hong Kong. The world is watching and wondering: If a government cannot respect the basic rights of people it claims as its own citizens, why on Earth would it be trusted to respect the rights and interests of its neighbors, its trading partners, or the companies that invest in its economy?"
"As we all know, the people of Hong Kong have been carrying the banner for decades. I am proud to say that here in the United States, we have been marching alongside them the entire way. Back in 1992, I was proud to author the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act and helped codify America's stance on the special status of Hong Kong."
"So on the 70th anniversary of the PRC and the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, I am grateful the administration and Congress, on a bipartisan basis, are reexamining America's relationship withthe PRC. I am grateful for the bipartisan work my colleagues have done on this important issue, and I am confident Congress will continue to hold hearings and stay vigilant on the subject of autonomy and democracy in Hong Kong, as well as China's overall strategy and its implications for the United States, our allies, and the entire world."
"  Mr. President, finally, 30 years and one week ago, democratic protestors gathered at Tiananmen Square, where the Chinese Communist Party brutally suppressed the will of the people. Today, in Hong Kong, a similar scene is playing out. The Chinese government is once again showing its true colors, suppressing democracy, denying the will of the people, trying to claw back more power and control."
The people of Hong Kong are rightfully protesting the Chinese government's interest in remanding potentially innocent people to mainland China in order to put them through the corrupt Chinese prison system. America stands with the people of Hong Kong in their protest against this blatant abuse of power by the government in Beijing.
"Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, let me start by thanking Senator Merkley for his hard work on this legislation. The House a few weeks before passed a similar measure, the PROTECT Hong Kong Act, authored by the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), whom I was about to refer to as the Chair but has now joined us here in the regular seats of the House."
"Such bipartisan, bicameral legislation supporting the people of Hong Kong is a testament to the relationship between our two peoples, but it is also an indication of Congress' deep concern over the growing violence in Hong Kong. In recent weeks, we have seen an escalation in the conflict between Hong Kong's security forces and the people of Hong Kong. The same police forces sworn to protect the people are now indiscriminately targeting people with tear gas, pepper spray, and water cannons. I am particularly heartbroken over the images of students under siege and parents begging the police not to shoot their children."
"We have seen similar images before, just 30 years ago in Beijing. The fact that these horrors are now taking place in Hong Kong, a beacon of democracy and human rights, is worrisome. I am deeply concerned by the recent escalation of violence, and I call on all parties to exercise restraint and seek a peaceful solution to address the very legitimate concerns of the people of Hong Kong."
"Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important measure and ensure that U.S. companies are not contributing to the suppression of Hong Kong's people in their fight to secure their freedoms and their democracy. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 2710, a bill that would prohibit the commercial export of covered munition items to the Hong Kong Police Force. Mr. Speaker, I especially want to thank my good friend and colleague, Chairman McGovern, for his legislation, which is pretty much a companion bill that passed a little over 1 month ago, again, on the whole idea of U.S.-originated equipment being exploited in Hong Kong against these protesters. I thank him for doing that. We have raised this at hearings, and his bill was a great bill."
"As the largest protest movement Hong Kong has ever seen continues, major concerns have arisen about the Hong Kong police's independence and professionalism. The people of Hong Kong are rightfully furious about well-documented cases of excessive force, brutal tactics, and tolerance of violence against protesters. The Hong Kong police themselves are now a cause of the protests."
"There has been widespread police misuse of crowd control equipment and less-lethal weaponry, including incidents that have seriously injured journalists. I am glad this bill is before us. After it passes, it goes to the President, and I fully expect he will sign it into law."
"Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, Members of this House will remember that, just a few months ago, we passed very similar legislation in the House to the bill that is in front of us today. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), who is an important leader on this issue."
"The gentleman wrote the House version of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from California (Mr. Sherman) for his leadership on this and so many other important issues to uphold a high standard of human rights. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2710, the Placing Restrictions on Teargas Exports and Crowd Control Technology to Hong Kong Act, otherwise known as the PROTECT Hong Kong Act. I am proud to have introduced this bipartisan legislation, along with my colleagues Chris Smith from New Jersey and Ro Khanna from California, in the House."
"Senator Merkley and Senator Cornyn introduced it in the Senate. This bill responds to the excessive and unnecessary use of force by the Hong Kong police targeting those engaged in peaceful protests. The PROTECT Hong Kong Act prohibits U.S. exports of police equipment to Hong Kong, including tear gas, pepper spray, grenades, rubber bullets, foam rounds, beanbag rounds, pepper balls, water cannons, stun guns, and tasers."
"The Hong Kong Police Force is simply out of control. The reckless and escalating use of violence flies in the face of manufacturer guidelines and international standards on the use of force. In recent days, the world has seen eyewitness evidence showing protesters sprayed with tear gas directly in the face at short distances, rampant beatings and arbitrary arrests of people ages 11 to 74, police driving at high speeds into crowds, and unarmed protesters shot with live rounds. The British Government already suspended export licenses for the sale of tear gas and crowd control equipment until concerns about human rights abuses are addressed. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights called for an investigation of the use of crowd control tactics in Hong Kong."
"Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. It is time for American companies to stop selling police equipment that is being used to suppress peaceful protests."
"Mr. Speaker, today, we will cast votes on two pieces of legislation that will make it crystal clear to Beijing that we in this Congress in a bipartisan manner stand in solidarity with the protesters of Hong Kong, and we also stand with them in their demands, among which is there needs to be an independent investigation and inquiry into the brutal tactics of the Hong Kong Police Force. It is absolutely outrageous. It goes beyond the pale. We have all seen the pictures, the photographs, and the videos that are on social media."
"Anybody who cares about human rights will stand with us proudly and vote for these two pieces of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this PROTECT Hong Kong Act. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for the purpose of closing."
"Mr. Speaker, we have watched as the Chinese Communist Party works to break down and undermine the ``one country, two systems'' framework that has paved the way for a strong relationship between Hong Kong and the United States. This has motivated millions of Hong Kongers, the people of Hong Kong, to take to the streets for months to protest in defense of their basic human rights. These prodemocracy activists have faced tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets by a police force sworn to protect them, and now they face lethal force as well. {time}  1615  The passage of this bill demonstrates, once again, to the people of Hong Kong that the United States stands with them in their protest of China's erosion of the autonomy and the way of life that was promised them back in 1997. It takes a step to ensure that U.S. companies demonstrate a commitment to U.S. values in this regard, making sure that U.S. companies aren't facilitating violence against the protestors by selling what we, sadly, know can be lethal crowd control mechanisms."
"This bill is an important part of Congress' response by the effort of Beijing to deprive Hong Kong of the autonomy and democracy that it was promised back in 1997. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time."
"Madam President, on an entirely different matter, like many of my colleagues, I watched images from Hong Kong this weekend and could not help but be moved by the residents of that metropolis. They are mounting a bold stand to preserve Hong Kong's autonomy from China and, by extension, defend their liberties. Over the weekend, more than 1 million residents, a staggering proportion of the population--about one in seven--took to the streets to protest a draft law that would allow the people of Hong Kong to be extradited to mainland China."
"Hong Kong residents rightly view this measure as another erosion of the rule of law and tightening of Beijing's grip on their imperiled autonomy. These are not just students or lawyers or intellectuals who have taken to the streets but a broad cross-section of Hong Kong's diverse society--all age groups, all professions, all walks of life--all committed to preserving the personal freedoms and judicial independence that have made Hong Kong such a special and prosperous city. The Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, which I sponsored, has, for nearly three decades, enshrined America's commitment to preserving Hong Kong's special status and its freedoms. This draft law is inconsistent with the Hong Kong Policy Act and puts Hong Kong on the path of becoming just another one of China's cities subject to Beijing's whims."
"As the Vice President stated last autumn, ``For a time, Beijing inched toward greater liberty and respect for human rights. But in recent years, China has taken a sharp U-turn toward control and oppression of its own people.'' I regret that reports from Guangdong to Xinjiang continue to prove him right as Beijing's grip on its own people grows tighter, even as the rest of the world marks its 30th anniversary of the violence in Tiananmen Square."
I encourage the administration to stay engaged and express our concerns with the authorities in Hong Kong before this proposal becomes law and the Chinese Communist Party further extends its control over the people of Hong Kong.
"Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act today will once again demonstrate our support for the people of Hong Kong. The House passed our version of the bill several weeks ago, and this version passed the Senate last night as well, demonstrating, without a doubt, that the U.S. Congress stands with the people of Hong Kong even during a particularly troubling time."
"We are seeing the escalation of violence in unprecedented ways, indiscriminate use of force against students, and troubling reports of Chinese forces directing and manipulating the security forces in Hong Kong. However, as Joshua Wong said when he was last here with us on Capitol Hill just a few weeks ago, the ``people of Hong Kong will never walk alone.'' That is a quote. Never has this been truer than today."
"Although the abuses and injustices that have been endured by the people of Hong Kong are clear and evident to everyone, the policy challenge that this presents for the United States is far more nuanced. It is my expectation that, when implementing this legislation, the Secretary of State will understand congressional intent that this legislation is designed to help the U.S. Government and the U.S. Congress better evaluate the erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy and, ultimately, stem the tide of China's aggressive behavior toward the people of Hong Kong. Our objective is not to punish Hong Kong, but to help preserve and protect Hong Kong's autonomy in the face of Beijing's flagrant disregard for ``one country, two systems,'' which they had promised."
"As such, we believe it is in the national security interest of the United States to protect the autonomy of Hong Kong. It is with that intent that this entire legislative exercise has been undertaken. I hope that in evaluating how to apply the mandates in this bill, this administration, and any future administration, will give the best interest of the people of Hong Kong the highest consideration. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."
"Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. First of all, I want to thank the distinguished chairman and the ranking member, Mr. McCaul, for their strong support for this effort, both bills that are up today. And I would also especially like to thank the Speaker for her leadership as well."
"Mr. Speaker, since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre 30 years ago, I have had the privilege of working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle, including, and especially, Speaker Pelosi,  Jim McGovern, my good friend--and he is the chairman of the China Commission, and I am ranking member--and Congressman Frank Wolf, a former Member who was tenacious in his fight for human rights, the rule of law, and democracy for the people of China. We have always believed that every person deserves better than the brutality so many endure in the systematic violations of their universally recognized human rights. China's ruthless dictators do not agree, and they are driven--they are obsessed--to tighten their control."
"Today, Mr. Speaker, Hong Kong is burning. The status quo is no longer. The brutal government crackdown on democracy activists has escalated."
"Tragically, under President Xi Jinping, human rights abuse throughout China has significantly worsened, including the pervasive use of torture, religious persecution, human trafficking, and genocide against Muslim Uighurs. Last month, Mr. Speaker, President Xi ominously warned of even more brutal violence to come in Hong Kong, threatening ``crushed bodies and shattered bones.'' And the Hong Kong Government, itself, prefers bullets and batons over peaceful and political dialog that would address the Hong Kong people's rightful grievances."
"That is a sad and disgusting reality, and it is what the Chinese Government, however, does best: suppress, repress, torture, kill, and censor. With the passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, the United States Congress is making it clear that beating, torturing, and jailing democracy activists is absolutely wrong. We stand in solidarity with the people of Hong Kong. There will be strong sanctions, other ramifications, for this crackdown, for this abuse of power."
"The people of Hong Kong have feared for their freedom for a long time. In 2014, Mr. Speaker, I met with Martin Lee and Anson Chan, two titans of Hong Kong's democracy movement. They and Scott Flipse, of the China Commission, and I met in my office for hours as we discussed the Chinese Communist Party's growing influence and their attempts that had already begun to degrade autonomy and human rights in Hong Kong."
"That is, Mr. Speaker, the genesis of this bill and our 5-year effort to push back on Beijing's pernicious interference in Hong Kong. In the midst of the 2014 Umbrella Movement, I first introduced, joined by Speaker Pelosi, the first Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. My CECC co-chair, Senator Brown of Ohio, introduced the same bill in the Senate. Over the years, in 2015 and 2017, Senator Rubio and I upgraded the bill to reflect the kidnapping of book sellers, the disqualification of elected lawmakers, and the political prosecutions of Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, Benny Tai, and many others. However, every time, every single time we pushed for passage, there was vigorous opposition from diplomats, so-called experts, committee chairs, and U.S. business interests in Hong Kong."
"So passage of this legislation is long overdue. My House bill, cosponsored by the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), my good friend and colleague, and 46 other bipartisan cosponsors passed last month on October 15."
"Today, we consider a final bill derived from working with our colleagues in the United States Senate. Specifically, the act directs the Secretary of State to report and certify to Congress, annually, whether Hong Kong continues to deserve special treatment under U.S. law, different from Mainland China, in such matters as trade, customs, sanctions enforcement, law enforcement cooperation, and protection of human rights and the rule of law. It directs the State Department not to deny entry visas based primarily on the applicant's arrest or detention for participating in nonviolent protest activities in Hong Kong. It requires, for the next 7 years, an annual report from the Commerce Department on whether Hong Kong Government adequately enforces U.S. export controls and sanctions laws, including on those goods and services transshipped to North Korea, Iran, or other countries relating to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, narcotics trafficking, and more."
"It requires an assessment of whether U.S. origin items, including software, technology, and services, have been transferred from Hong Kong to China in violation of U.S. law and have been used by China for mass surveillance, predictive policing, or for the so-called social credit system. I know some Members might be wondering: What is the social credit system? It is a ubiquitous, totalitarian, ``brave new world'' system scheduled for implementation by 2020 that uses public records, online activity, and other tools of surveillance to aggregate data on every Chinese citizen and business and use that data to monitor, shape, and rate financial, social, religious, or political behaviors. The bill requires the President to submit a strategy to Congress, to protect U.S. citizens and businesses in Hong Kong from the erosion of autonomy and the rule of law because of actions taken by the Chinese Government. It requires the President to identify and sanction persons in Hong Kong or in Mainland China responsible for extrajudicial rendition and gross violations of internationally recognized human rights."
"The Chinese Government warns us repeatedly not to interfere in China's internal affairs, but the only interference we see is Beijing's meddling in the democratic freedoms of Hong Kong. All I see and this body sees, my fellow colleagues, is Beijing's failure to honor the promises made in the 1984 Sino-British declaration, an international treaty. All we see is Beijing's failure to honor the promises of Hong Kong's Basic Law. We cannot avert our eyes to what is happening in Hong Kong. We cannot silence our voices when the rule of law, democracy, human rights, free speech, and autonomy are being threatened in Hong Kong."
"We must remain steadfast in support of the people of Hong Kong. The whole world has a stake in a peaceful and just resolution in Hong Kong. The passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act is an important signal that this Congress, Democrat and Republican alike, House and Senate, considers Hong Kong's freedoms and autonomy a critical interest of the United States and the international community. In Hong Kong, they encourage each other to keep pressing forward with the phrase ``Jia you.'' So today, I say to you, all of you in Hong Kong: ``Jia you.'' Your cause is a noble, one and you will not be forgotten."
"Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), our Speaker of the House, who has been very, very active in Hong Kong freedom. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman for yielding. I salute him and Mr. McCaul, the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee."
"To you, Mr. Chairman and Mr. McCaul, thank you for affording this opportunity to vote on the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. This is a proud day for the U.S. Congress, for our values of freedom and justice, and for the people of Hong Kong."
"For 6 months, the people of Hong Kong have stirred the hearts of all freedom-loving people with their extraordinary outpouring of courage and their refusal to relinquish their demand for democracy, the democratic freedoms, and the rule of law which was promised more than two decades ago. Today, the Congress is sending an unmistakable message to the world that the United States stands in solidaritywith the freedom-loving people of Hong Kong, and we fully support their fight for freedom. We salute Chairman McGovern, a leading voice for human rights in China and around the world, our Congressional-Executive Commission on China chair and also chair of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Smith, just listening to him talk about we are into our third generation of freedom-loving people in Hong Kong."
"I am so glad Mr. Smith acknowledged the work of our distinguished former colleague, Frank Wolf, who was so, so very much a part and still continues to be a spiritual leader to us in this regard. We have worked with Martin Lee and Anson Chan way back when and--so late 1980s, early 1990s--then into this new century with another generation; and now, three generations, Martin Lee still being involved, but with Joshua Wong and Nathan Wong and all of the young participants who are there, because it is a sad situation. In 1997, when the United Kingdom transferred Hong Kong to China, America was hopeful that the people of Hong Kong would achieve the ``high degree of autonomy''--that is in quotes--``high degree of autonomy'' that they were promised."
"Today, it is beyond question that China has utterly broken that promise. America has been watching for years as the people of Hong Kong have been increasingly denied their full autonomy and faced with a cruel crackdown on their freedoms and an escalation of violence. Most recently, the violent attacks against students at Hong Kong Polytechnic University have shocked the world as unconscionable and unacceptable. More than 1,000 young people were denied food, water, first aid. Scores were sent to the hospital for hypothermia after attempting to escape through a sewer, and hundreds now languish in jail cells."
"Right now, frightened parents of the students who remain on campus are holding vigil outside, praying that their children will be safe, clutching signs reading: ``Save the kids. Don't kill our children,'' and, ``They are children of God. Let them go.'' In the Congress, Democrats and Republicans stand united with the protestors and with the people of Hong Kong."
"We have stood united in a bipartisan way. It has been a very unifying issue for us, whether we are talking about the autonomy of Tibet that the Chinese are trying to destroy, the culture, the language, and the region of Tibet; the Uighurs, where 1, 2, 3, maybe 3 million Uighurs are under education camps, which the Chinese Government says they really enjoy being in--Oh, really?--or human rights violations, suppression of human rights throughout all of China. {time}  1545  If America does not speak out for human rights in China because of commercial interests, we lose all moral authority to speak out on human rights elsewhere."
"Since Tiananmen Square, many of us in a bipartisan way have been fighting this fight, and we have seen that commercial interests always win the fight. It has always for them been about money."
"To those who take the repressive Chinese Government's side, I say: What does it profit a person to gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his soul? Today the House is proud to once again pass the bicameral, bipartisan Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act to reaffirm America's commitment to human rights, democracy, and the rule of law in the face of Beijing's crackdown. I see we have been joined by the distinguished ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. McCaul. I thank him for his leadership in bringing this legislation to the floor."
"I acknowledged him earlier, along with our distinguished chairman, Mr. Engel. We are proud to pass the Senate version of Chairman McGovern's Protect Hong Kong Act to suspend sales on dangerous munitions to the Hong Kong police, and we also salute Senator Merkley in his leadership in passing that on the Senate floor. The future of Hong Kong, the future of autonomy, freedom, and justice for millions is at stake. America must take a stand with Hong Kong."
"I am so pleased that we are making our statement in Congress in the House and in the Senate on both sides of the aisle, Democrats and Republicans unified in speaking out for democracy. I urge a ``yes'' vote on both of these bills. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey."
"Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul), the ranking member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise today in support of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. Two months ago I had the opportunity to join a press conference with Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Chairman Engel, my colleague, Chris Smith, and Hong Kong prodemocracy activists Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, and Denise Ho to denounce China's authoritarian brutality. I said it then and I will say it again; today we stand here not as Republicans or Democrats, but as Americans united in our strong support for Hong Kong."
"And I would like to take this opportunity to speak directly to the people of Hong Kong, who I know are watching this right now. America stands with you, and America will always support you. We hear you sing our national anthem."
"We see you carrying our American flag. This is a battle between democracy versus dictatorship, liberty versus tyranny, and freedom versus oppression."
"This bill sends a clear message to China that there will be consequences to the ruthless and brutal actions. Congress, the United States, and the world will not stand by idly as the Chinese Communist Party fights for itself and not its own people."
"Again, I want to thank the authors of this bill. I am proud to be a part of this movement, this cause. And we have seen quite a bit of response on social media on this bill coming directly from the people of Hong Kong to the Members who are on this floor saying thank you for standing up for us. That is democracy in action. That is what this country stands for."
"And it is a proud moment, I think, for both sides of the aisle as we are going through this time in our history to be able to stand together for democracy and such a great movement and cause for freedom. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), an important leader on this issue. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1838, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act."
"I want to say thank you to Speaker Nancy Pelosi for her incredible leadership in ensuring that the House made a timely and unequivocal statement in support of the Hong Kong people at this very important and vital time. I would also like to thank Congressman Chris Smith of New Jersey, as well as Chairman Engel and Ranking Member McCaul for bringing this legislation to the floor today. I also appreciate the leadership of Senators Rubio, Cardin, and Menendez for all that they have done. Mr. Speaker, in recent months, the situation in Hong Kong has worsened as the Chinese and Hong Kong Governments have escalated repression against the protest movement and provoked more violence and chaos."
"The recent attacks on university campuses, including last weekend against students at Hong Kong Polytechnic University raises disturbing questions on the strategy of the Chinese and Hong Kong Governments. Protestors were violently assaulted and not even allowed to escape without facing a barrage of tear gas and police brutality. It is long past time for the Chinese and Hong Kong Governments to try a different approach that respects the people of Hong Kong and restores the people's faith in the autonomy of the government. That is what political leaders do, they use dialogue and negotiation to achieve their goals."
"The demands of the protestors are reasonable, and an independent inquiry into the police violence is more than justified. In what was initially a positive development, this week the Hong Kong High Court decided that the government's recent facemask ban was unconstitutional. Unfortunately, the fierceresponse by Beijing to that ruling and claim of sole jurisdiction over constitutional review almost certainly violates the basic law, subverts the rule of law, and further undermines whatever trust the Hong Kong people have left in their governing institutions. If the Hong Kong court system is not sufficiently autonomous, then it is difficult, if not impossible, to argue that Hong Kong is sufficiently autonomous. It should be clear by now that Hong Kong's leaders are beholden to the Chinese Government, and the independence of the judiciary is being undermined."
"The ``one country, two systems'' framework enshrined in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and Hong Kong's basic law has been rapidly eroding and has now reached a point when the United States has no choice but to modify its policy toward Hong Kong. It is time we put the Chinese Government on annual notice that further erosion of autonomy or a crackdown will cause the city, which serves as an important financial haven for wealthy Chinese elites, to lose its special economic, financial and trade arrangement with the United States. Further, the legislation authorizes sanctions against individuals who violate human rights, and states that Hong Kong visa applicants should not be denied entry to the U.S. on the basis of politically-motivated arrests due to their protest activities."
"Today a Chinese official said that they will take strong opposing measures if the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy bill passes. Well, I have a message for Beijing: The United States will not stand idly by while the Chinese Government stifles free expression and tightens its grip on Hong Kong. Over the years, Hong Kong has prospered and become the financial center of Asia because of its strong commitment to the rule of law, good governance, human rights, and an open economic system."
"We must use our leverage to help the people of Hong Kong in their struggle to secure a democratic future that protects Hong Kong's autonomy and way of life. I am proud to support this legislation, which we will pass today with an overwhelmingly bipartisan majority."
"I now call upon the President of the United States, who has been way too silent on this issue, to sign the bill into law. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho), the ranking member of the Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation Subcommittee. Mr. Speaker, I just want to give a shout-out to the bipartisan nature of this bill. Both sides are working strongly on this."
"Chairman Engel, thank you. Mr. McGovern, thank you. Chris, thank you for doing what you have done."
"It is true leadership. And to see Speaker Pelosi down here, I think it speaks loudly to how America stands on this. In September, I, too, had the honor of meeting with a few of the courageous leaders of Hong Kong student unions."
"They were advocating for peace, liberty, and freedom. These are basic innate human rights that have been taken away from Hong Kongers by the authoritarian overreach of the Chinese Communist Party Complex, which is comprised of Xi Jinping, the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party, and leadership within the People's Liberation Army. As protests in Hong Kong continue into the sixth month, Xi Jinping still refuses to take responsibility for this unrest."
"The cause is simple: theft of basic rights and freedoms, not a separatist movement or foreign influence. Members of this body have been accused of being the cause of the protests."
"Speaker Pelosi was named individually. Senator Schumer, Marco Rubio, and I were named as the cause of the Hong Kong protests."
"This disdain was sparked by the introduction of the infamous extradition bill by Chief Executive Carrie Lam at the command of the CCPC and has grown into what are known as the five demands. Had Xi Jinping and his cohorts just honored the 1997 international agreement between Great Britain and China, which allows Hong Kong to remain a self-ruling, semi-autonomous province, none of this would have occurred. Not upholding one's contract has consequences. Disregarding contracts breaks trust and dishonors the country, its leaders, and its people."
The narrative that the Chinese Communist Party Complex has created for itself is that China cannot and should not be trusted and that the party will go to great lengths to dismantle free societies in their backyard. The survival of democracy and freedom exposes the failures of communism.
"Xi Jinping, along with his cohorts' lack of acknowledgment of their failures, whether from deliberate denial or complete ignorance, was demonstrated by Mr. Han Zheng, China's Vice Premier, who said he believes antigovernment protests are damaging the ``one country, two systems'' formula, and again, are caused by a separatist movement and foreign influence. While sitting next to Chief Executive Carrie Lam, he continued, ``We firmly support the Special Administrative Region Government to adopt more proactive and more effective measures'' to solve the social problems. Since I wrote this, they have come out and said they expect to have brutality ramped up to bring these people under control. The proactive and more effective measures referred to by Mr. Han Zheng are intimidation, brutality, imprisonment and death."
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman's time has expired.
"Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Florida an additional 1 minute. Mr. Speaker, as the international community is well aware, Beijing's standard procedure for dealing with unrest is well documented."
"In the end, Xi Jinping will leave no stone unturned in his quest to destroy democracy. The party will spare no one in their fight to protect communist ideals and power. Chief Executive Lam will be Beijing's sacrificial lamb and removed for two reasons: one, the Communist Party must save face and have a scapegoat; and two, Xi Jinping and the Communist Party must maintain their authority and not show weakness. Communism fears free thought and cannot survive in it."
"And I am honored to stand with the Hong Kong protestors in their important cause. I urge my colleagues to also stand with the courageous individuals in Hong Kong and pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. ``Jia you'' to our Hong Kong friends standing up for your basic human rights. Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman), and I ask unanimous consent that he be allowed to control the time."
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York?
"There was no objection. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey."
"Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill). Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey, my good friend, for yielding, and I have to thank him for his decades of service and leadership here for free expression and for liberty in Hong Kong. I was moved by the Speaker's tribute and appreciate her 30 years of work there."
"I thank Mr. Engel for his leadership, and, of course, my good friend from California, who now is controlling the time for the majority. {time}  1600  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act and stand in solidarity with the people of Hong Kong. For 6 months, we have witnessed Hong Kong citizens protest for their right to live in a free and fair political system, an expectation they fully have."
"Over the last several weeks, we have witnessed the government become increasingly violent as it cracks down on protests. It is sad to see death and destruction come to this beautiful and energetic place. For three decades, I have traveled to Hong Kong and witnessed their innovative spirit and their extraordinary work ethic. In fact, Hong Kong was the model for the post-World War II AsianTiger growth and prosperity now shared across the region."
"When a proponent of welfare statism queried progrowth economist Melvyn B. Krauss, ``But how many Hong Kongs can the world have?'' the professor responded, ``As many as the world will allow itself.''"
"The 7 million citizens of Hong Kong are looking to us for a voice and for leadership, and with today's vote, we will deliver. I call on President Trump to sign this important measure into law with expediency and show the world that America supports the people of Hong Kong, their right to free expression, and their democratic governance guaranteed under the five-decade arrangement agreed to in 1997 by the People's Republic of China and the United Kingdom. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Smith for his leadership, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this measure."
"Mr. Speaker, I will close when the gentleman has closed on his side, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey."
"Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, the United States' and the world's response to the Tiananmen Square massacre 30 years ago and the massive crackdown that was unleashed after that, because of that weak response, has enabled unrelenting and pervasive human rights abuses ever since. Had we been strong and predictable and said that human rights matter, had we linked it to MFN, most-favored-nation status, and stuck to it, we would have had a different China today that, at least more than it does today, would have respected the rule of law and human rights. We cannot recommit that mistake by being weak and vacillating in the face of this terrible, terrible attack on the people of Hong Kong and on their autonomy."
"Remember, what we are asking Xi Jinping, Carrie Lam, and all the other leaders in Hong Kong and in Beijing to do is just honor your promises; you made solemn promises that you are violating now with impunity. We have to be very clear that if we enable that, if we look the other way, then we become unwittingly, perhaps, but complicit in this terrible degrading of the human rights situation for the people of Hong Kong. Mr. Speaker, I want to remind my colleagues as well, and I think we all know this, but this bill is the work of so many who deeply care, many Members across the aisle, bipartisanship at a time when that seems to be pretty much a rare commodity, but when it comes to Hong Kong, we are all there joined together arm-in-arm speaking out on behalf of these tremendous leaders who suffer and go to prison and endure tear gas and worse each and every day."
"I want to mention some of the staff members, and there are many. When we had the bill up on the 15th, I mentioned even more. But these members were instrumental in working on the legislation over the past 5 years. Remember, this is the fourth time I introduced it, and I have worked with Marco Rubio and others."
"This is a bicameral and bipartisan bill. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank former staff directors of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, Paul Protic and Elise Anderson, for their important work on Hong Kong and China. I want to thank Piero Tozzi of my staff for his focus on human rights in China and around the world. I particularly want to mention the contribution made to this legislation by Scott Flipse of the CECC, the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. In 2014, Dr. Flipse first convinced me."
"We had met, and he said that we have a problem in Hong Kong and that we need to address it. I was co-chair of the China Commission. Then we had meetings with Chinese leaders and Hong Kong leaders."
"We began to see that what was taking place in somewhat slow motion before our eyes was that there was a long-term Beijing plan to undermine Hong Kong's autonomy and that the U.S. needed to focus its efforts on countering that plan. He has been a stalwart advocate for the people of Hong Kong ever since, and I, again, want to thank him for his critical contributions to this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."
"Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for the purpose of closing. We vote today on S. 1838, but this is not just a Senate bill."
"This is a bill very similar to the one introduced in this House by the gentleman from New Jersey. This House has already voted on this bill and supported it overwhelmingly. Today, once again, we show the world our commitment to the people of Hong Kong and to the preservation and protection of Hong Kong's autonomy, given China's aggressive attempts to undermine the ``one country, two systems'' approach. With this important legislation, we send a clear signal that the United States will hold those undermining Hong Kong's rights and autonomy accountable and that the American people stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Hong Kong."
"With few exceptions, the people of Hong Kong have fought for their rights through peaceable protest, and we stand with them. Mr. Speaker, I hope all Members will join me in supporting the passage of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time."
"  Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with the people of Hong Kong. Last month, I had the opportunity to hear directly from leaders in Hong Kong dedicated to both religious tolerance and to democracy, as promised in the ``one country, two systems'' agreement."
"The people of Hong Kong wave American flags during their protests as a symbol of the freedoms that they desire. Now is the time for Congress to support the people of Hong Kong and pass Representative Chris Smith's bill, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. This measure states without question that the United States Government supports the people of Hong Kong and their right to freedom of expression and democratic governance guaranteed under their 50-year arrangement agreed to in 1997 by China and the United Kingdom."
"Madam President, now, on a totally different matter, Hong Kong has been rocked by more violence as citizens continue resisting the Chinese Communist Party's encroachment on their autonomy and freedoms. On Monday, it appears the local police shot a 21-year-old protester at nearly point-blank range. The police have arrested hundreds of demonstrators, reportedly as young as 12 and as old as 82."
"Tear gas, rubber bullets, and other violent measures have now become standard fare. A few days earlier, a number of democracy-supporting Hong Kong legislators were swept up in a government crackdown. These elected officials were either arrested or given summons just a few weeks before local elections. These continuing government escalations are inconsistent with the Hong Kong Basic Law, with international agreements, and with the will of Hongkongers."
Brutalizing their own people will not circumvent the core issue here: Beijing's insatiable thirst for control. I have advocated for Hong Kong since I wrote our Nation's Hong Kong Policy Act back in 1992. I know many of us in this body now want to extend and expand that law in a targeted manner that focuses pressure on the Chinese Communist Party and its agents who are responsible for undermining Hong Kong's autonomy while minimizing the collateral economic damage to the very Hongkongers we want to help.
"I am eager to continue working with colleagues, such as Senator Risch, Senator Graham, Senator Rubio, and others, toward a strong and procedurally workable solution. Meanwhile, I appreciate statements by administration leaders such as Vice President Pence and Secretary Pompeo that show a clear-eyed perspective on China's Orwellian tactics and bad intentions. I urge the administration to use the significant leverage and authorities it already has, particularly under the Global Magnitsky Act, to hold individuals accountable. Hong Kong is not the only recent reminder that we live in a dangerous world in which America's interests, allies, and ideals are constantly threatened."
"Press reports this morning indicated that Israel is suffering yet another round of terror, including more than 160 rocket launches fired against civilian targets in Israel. This comes after Israeli forces appear to have eliminated one high-ranking leader in the terrorist group Palestinian Islamic Jihad, in Gaza, and targeted another PIJ terrorist in Damascus, Syria. The United States stands with our ally Israel against PIJ, Hamas, and Hezbollah terrorists who have long sought to erase the Jewish State. If these reports are accurate, it will be no surprise that one of these terrorist leaders was holed up in Damascus."
"Syria, under Assad, stands alongside Iran as the chief patron of anti-Israel terrorism. This is just another reminder that the United States and some of our closest allies have a strong say in the future of Syria and that a victory for Assad will be a victory for Iran and for terrorism. So every hour seemingly brings more evidence of our troubled world, but, just as with the trade agreements, critical legislation in this area is currently frozen in place."
"It is another casualty of Democrats' apparent inability to make headway on anything besides fighting with the White House. For the second time in 2 months, Senate Democrats recently voted once again to filibuster the annual funding for our Armed Forces--for our men and women in uniform--and while Senate Democrats block appropriations for defense, House Democrats are now slow-walking the authorizing legislation--the NDAA. Since the first NDAA was passed way back in 1961, Congress has never failed to pass a bipartisan NDAA by the end of the year--not once."
"Yet with House Democrats fixated on impeachment, I understand that Chairman Adam Smith and his fellow Democrats are now dragging their heels on the conference committee that is needed to complete this bill. These House Democrats passed a uniquely partisan NDAA earlier this year, unlike the Senate's bipartisan version, and now they are slow-walking the conference committee. These are among our most basic governing responsibilities: passing an NDAA and funding our Armed Forces."
The United States of America cannot operate at less than full strength on the world stage because Democrats are too busy--too busy--impeaching the Commander in Chief.
"Mr. President, on a final matter, in the last few days, the reports and images coming out of Hong Kong have become even more disturbing. The police crackdown on Hongkongers who are standing up for their freedom and their region's autonomy has intensified. University campuses now literally look like war zones, with government forces laying siege to groups of students and other protesters."
"Many observers feel the situation may be verging on something truly terrible. In the midst of this crackdown, just today, Hong Kong's High Court ruled against the executive and actually in favor of the protesters' rights--yet another signal it is the government that is acting beyond the bounds of its authorities. This latest escalation against Hongkongers comes as Beijing faces international fallout from leaked documents that delineate the government's chilling, systematic campaign against ethnic minorities in another supposedly autonomous region, Xinjiang--hundreds of pages of internal documents from the Chinese Communist Party government. It is a handbook for this Orwellian campaign to effectively erase a religious and ethnic minority in a region that, again, is supposed to be legally distinct from the rest of China."
This effort is being conducted using ``organs of dictatorship'' and ``absolutely no mercy.'' The protesters are not the problem. It is Beijing and the Hong Kong leadership that must deescalate.
"The Communist Party must know it will hurt them catastrophically if it turns Hong Kong into some 21st century version of Tiananmen Square. The United States would not forget it, and neither would China's other trading partners all across the world. So what can the United States do? In September, I worked to add language to the State and Foreign Operations appropriations bill to modify the reporting requirements of the 1992 Hong Kong Policy Act, which, by the way, was my bill back in 1992."
"My additions would work to expose the current tools the Chinese Communist government is using to subvert the autonomy of Hong Kong and to allow the U.S. Government to pay for the legal support for Hong Kong's democracy activists. One important step to help Hong Kong is for the House and Senate Democrats to finally get to ``yes'' on the appropriations process. Last week, I had a productive meeting with the senior Senator from Florida on the subject of revising and extending the Hong Kong Policy Act through new legislation. As I indicated, I authored the original bill back in 1992 and have been keenly interested in Hong Kong's status for decades."
"So I appreciate the leadership Senator Rubio and others have shown and hope we can find a way to move this important bill. Yet, while I support additional legislation, the United States does not need to wait for new laws to act further. There are already significant tools at the administration's disposal, and I strongly encourage them to use them."
"I have been encouraged to hear clear statements on China from key members of President Trump's team in recent months. I would encourage this President, who has seen Chinese behavior for what it is with a clarity that others have lacked, not to shy away from speaking out on Hong Kong himself. The world should hear from him directly that the United States stands with these brave men and women."
"This administration has rightly understood what prior administrations have entirely missed. The old consensus was that economic modernization in China would automatically import our values of freedom and human dignity into their society. Now, every day reminds us that this simply has not happened."
"Instead, Beijing is using modern technology it has obtained through integration with the West to further its political and social control over its own population and expand China's reach beyond its shores. So, rather than focusing solely on trade, I encourage the administration to make Hong Kong's autonomy a key topic within our bilateral diplomacy. The administration should also take advantage of the tools Congress has already provided in Global Magnitsky to target the individuals who are responsible for egregious human rights abuses. In Xinjiang and Hong Kong, the world is seeing the true face of the Communist Party of China."
"The United States has a role to play in standing up for the universal principles of human rights, and I am confident we will fulfill it. Yet our allies and partners must also ask themselves whether they are prepared to live in a world that is being increasingly shaped by those who show absolutely no mercy to religious and ethnic minorities and who confront peaceful protest with violence."
"Mr. President, this past week we saw the largest protest in Hong Kong since 2014. Millions turned out in order to protest the erosion of civil rights, human rights, and good governance in Hong Kong, violating the commitment that was made during the July 1, 1997, transfer of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to China. We saw China backtracking in 2014 on its electoral changes, when the candidate for the Chief Executive had to be screened by the Chinese Government, contrary to the commitments that were made when Hong Kong's relationship with the United Kingdom ended."
"The protests in 2014 were called the Umbrella Movement because a large amount of protesters, who were being attacked by the police with tear gas, were using umbrellas to protect themselves from the tear gas itself. The ``one country, two systems'' that was developed after the United Kingdom relinquished its control in 1997 was a commitment that Hong Kong would be a capitalistic system and the way of life that existed before the transfer to the Chinese would be upheld and unchanged. That was the commitment that was given, and that commitment has not been lived up to by China. There is the Chinese interference we saw in 2014, and then this time we saw the government of Hong Kong try to implement an extradition law that provided real concern about people who disagreed with what is happening in China and who wanted to protest about their universal rights of being subjected to extradition to China."
"This is not hypothetical; this is a real concern. Two million people went to the streets this month in Hong Kong to protest that erosion of rights in Hong Kong, basically at the insistence of the Chinese Government. This is not theoretical."
"Lam Wing-kee is one example. I can give many examples. In 2015, he mysteriously disappeared. He was selling literature in Hong Kong that was banned by the Chinese Communist Party in China, not Hong Kong, supposedly."
"He disappeared from the streets and ended up in China, in solitary confinement in one of their prisons. He was ultimately allowed to leave with certain commitments. He decided to flee to Taiwan and stay safe there. There are so many other examples of individuals who are in jeopardy."
"The extradition law that was being proposed really put the fear into those people who live in Hong Kong and visit Hong Kong that if they did anything that would upset the Chinese Government, they could be charged with a crime in China and extradited to China, never to be seen again. Millions turned out in protest. As a result of the protests and, quite frankly, the international spotlight on what was happening in Hong Kong, the government decided to withdraw the extradition--the proposed law, but they didn't say they would withdraw it permanently and made no commitments about any future."
"And, of course, the current chief executive remains there, which is very much against the reforms that were supposed to take place. The United States has spoken on this issue. The United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 allows the United States to treat the territory as separate from the rest of China politically, economically, and otherwise under certain conditions."
"Those conditions are that Hong Kong remain sufficiently autonomous from China and that the rights of its citizens be protected. That is specific in our law. I question, as I think many of us do, whether Hong Kong and China are complying with the conditions under which the United States passed the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 that allows for preferential treatment in Hong Kong that is not enjoyed by China."
"Last week, Senator Rubio and I, with the support of the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, introduced the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. It reaffirms the act that we passed in 1992 to make it clear that Hong Kong's recognition by the United States and its trading relationship with the United States and its special relationship with the United States--much different from China--only exist if the conditions on autonomy are maintained. Under this legislation, we require the administration to periodically certify to us that Hong Kong is, in fact, in compliance with the conditions of the 1992 law. If not, special exceptions would no longer be valid."
"We also put into this statute sanctions against those who are responsible for abridging the human rights of people in Hong Kong. This is similar to what we did in regard to the Magnitsky statutes. I am very proud of the work this Chamber did, particularly the work I was able to do with our late colleague Senator McCain on passing the Magnitsky laws."
"We first applied it to Russia. We then applied it globally. Now we have seen other countries also apply these sanctions where if a person violates basic, internationally recognized human rights, that individual is denied the opportunity to visit America by not allowing any visa or the use of our banking system. We extend those types of sanctions in regard to those who are violating the rights of the people of Hong Kong. Let me point out that our foreign policy--our strength is American values."
"It is the values we stand for as a nation--democracy, support for human rights, the basic freedom of people, religious freedom. Those are the values America brings to our engagement globally."
"It is important that we be on the right side of history in regard to Hong Kong and that the Congress and the American people stand in solidarity with the people of Hong Kong; that we stand with them and the commitment that was given in 1997 that Hong Kong would be different and autonomous from China and the rights of their people would be protected, as they were under British control. It is important today that the Senate, the Congress, the American people, and our government stand by those commitments and stand with the people of Hong Kong. We saw millions show up this week to show their support for these principles. We must stand with those people."
