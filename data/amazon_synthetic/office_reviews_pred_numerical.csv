0,"I bought this pen from Amazon about a month ago. As soon as I got it I filled it with Noodler's black. I was disappointed because it felt scratchy when writing on various papers; so I had to press hard to avoid skipping. Even my less expensive pens wrote a lot smoother than this. Then about a week after I noticed ink in the barrel as well as the converter. When I checked I noticed the flat o-ring that sits between the nib housing and the ink converter was broken. I believe I received a faulty pen! As a temporary measure I used some white silicone in that area. Now the pen looks dry and attractive, it writes without skipping (writing as fast as I can)and it seems to feel smoother with use. Go ahead and get one. You will enjoy controlling the thickness of your line between extra fine & broad. This looks as if it will last.",7,6.1676006
1,"Wonderful desk. I love that you can adjust the angle of the top, and the little book holder ledge is removable so it's not in the way when the tray is flat. Where do you put the little ledge, you ask? In the attached drawer! So handy.
Also like that the legs are adjustable. I sit cross-legged and can't put it over my lap, but with the legs extended it's the correct height.
Definitely recommend.",2,5.084481
2,"I have bought quite a few after-market toner cartridges in my life, and they can sometimes be hit or miss in terms of quality.  Some of the cartridges you will find out there get black dust all over your hands when you open them.  Others work but start to fail fairly quickly.  I was sent this cartridge for free for the purposes of evaluation, so I wanted to take my time with it and make sure it worked before I could recommend it.

When I opened the box, I found that the cartridge was clean and looked high quality.  It was properly sealed and installed quickly and easily into my printer, just like the OEM ones from Brother.  I was instantly printing out pages with no issue.  Two months and hundreds of pages later, the cartridge is still going strong and giving me high quality print outs.  What else could I ask for?  This is a recommended brand for an after-market toner cartridge.",14,7.003848
3,"The first thing I did was try the ""bang on the top while turning knob to unlock"" method, and it literally unlocked the first time I tried. I used this method another five times or so to ensure it wasn't a fluke, and it wasn't. What is the point to having a keypad and key when you can just bang on the dang thing to open it?! I was going to use this to keep kids away from dangerous/expensive items, but with being able to get around the lock so easily, this is just not worth the money. Literally the only purpose to it, at that point, would be to keep young kids out, since older kids could easily learn and employ the bang on the top method to open it. Ridiculous flaw to what is supposed to be a secure container.",5,4.270639

6,"I bought this LTB MFG Shipping Labels to print labels from my laser printer at home. I bought 4 Per Sheet 3.5"" x 5"" sheet one. Each sheet has 4 labels and 100 - sheet package is giving me 400 labels which is quite enough for a year or more. The price for this amazing quality product is unbeatable. The sheets are thin enough and my printer doesnt have any problem printing on it. The quality of print is as crisp and clean as it is on regular paper. There are some label stickers which are too thick for regular printers and not all printers are able to print on them. This is not the case with this product. It is compatible with any regular household printers. Im printing the labels from my Brother HL-L2340DW and I have a bad experience with thicker label sheets which caused a jam on the same printer. These shipping labels have a smooth-feed sheet edges which prevent from printer jams. What also like about these labels, it provides the information about compatible MS Word template on the package. 3.5x5 package compatible with Avery 5168 Template. All you need to do is, open this template from MS Word on Mailings Menu, write From / To information on popup dialog box, choose the right font size and press print  that is it. Your document is ready to print on these labels without any other adjustments.

Overall, my experience with these shipping labels is super positive. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for solid quality product for great price.

I have received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. Hopefully this review helps you in making your purchasing decision!",3,5.9911175
7,"This fantastic little sharpener is deceptively small. Compact might be a better word.  I needed a sharpener for fat pencils, and wanted one which could also work for my colored pencils, especially my soft-core prismacolor premiere & Prismacolor Verithin.  I previously bought the Prismacolor sharpener with dual holes-one for each of those brands/types of pencils, and it works very well-I think there's a review for it too. But I keep my pencils in two locations and I got very tired of always needing the sharpener and it being in the location I wasn't!

When I read all the reviews about one sharpener after another, from 99 cent plain one hole blades to fancy sharpeners, electric, battery operated, etc. which were supposed to be awesome, I really thought I'd run out of luck!  I decided to skip the fancy, save money and look for a manual multi-size sharpener. This came up on my search list...and was exactly what I needed!

I bought it from TCP Global Corp, which is my go-to seller when amazon's price is higher, or whoever sells the product doesn't offer free shipping (be sure to check-some items are NOT free to ship from TCP).  So I stuck this in an order with some other art supplies and as usual, got it quickly and in good shape.

The large hole works perfectly for jumbo pencils, such as the kind small children are given to use, and worked for the oversize multi-color novelty pencils I'd bought. Next to that hole/blade is a standard sharpener for regular #2 HB pencils or other graphite pencils, and does a great job on cheap or expensive pencils alike. Opposite these two holes is the colored pencil sharpener. It's labeled with Faber Castell's brand of colored pencil ""color grip"".  I have used it on my Prismacolor premiere soft cores and it works just as well as prismacolor's sharpener, though the shavings have to be dumped more frequently as the bin for them is much smaller than that of the Prismacolor (black, stand up with lid 2 hole sharpener for soft-core and Verithin pencils specifically-also recommended) sharpener intended for lots of use with colored pencils.

This sharpener is superior in that it has 3 types of sharpeners, and is small and portable but still holds shavings from average sharpening of one to three pencils and more if you're just touching up.  It works like a ""clamshell"" and splits open along the black line in the center, revealing the two holes on one side of the hinge (jumbo and standard) with one hole on the opposite side (the colored pencil sharpener). The shavings are held right under the sharpeners, so the side with 2 holes will fill faster with shavings from two kinds of pencils, if you sharpen both types regularly.  I rarely use jumbo size pencils, so it's not an issue for me. Obviously, there's a bit more room for colored pencil shavings since that side holds only one sharpener.

The neat little trick of this compact sharpener (or, if you're not very dexterous in the fingers, a possible complication) is that when you close it, you turn it around and open the BACK side where there are two arrows. You need to be a bit more careful opening these, and have your trash bin handy (or whatever you dump shavings into). I recommend only opening one end at a time so you don't have shavings falling out in two directions at once! Holding it over a table or paper cup, etc. will allow shavings to escape, so a little care is a good idea.

As some reviewers noted, you can drop these-hopefully your trash can doesn't have regular trash in it!- because they come completely off, unlike the opening where the sharpeners are located, which don't come off from that side and are hinged together. Once you've dumped the shavings and put the bins back in place (arrows should both point at each other), you're good to go, and can turn it around to face front again, ready to open and sharpen some more pencils!!!

If you don't want any hassle or mess with a portable, hand-powered sharpener, you might want to stick with an old fashioned one which you just hold in your hand with no receptacle for shavings.

I did find one kind of pencil which I won't put in this sharpener again. I tried (and will be reviewing-they are awesome) Derwent's Inktense watersoluble ink colored pencils. If you haven't heard of these, the product page has an excellent explanation. (If you think you'd like them, don't be cautious-order the 24 set, skip the 12-but that's another review!)  The Inktense has a soft, chalky (not smooth) consistency unlike smoother colored pencils which are not watersoluble.  I'm guessing any watercolor pencils with similar lead characteristics would be a problem in any sharpener which collects shavings.  I used a Faber Castell sharpener-the most basic metal kind-on the Inktense pencils, and it works fine.  The problem was that the chalky consistency smeared onto the sharpening blade and 'clogged' it up.  Easy enough to clean, and if all else fails, you could run it under water to dissolve the pencil 'lead' on the blade. My Prismacolor colored pencil sharpener encountered the same problem, so I'm guessing it's a matter of pigment, not brand or quality, etc.

That's the ONLY type of pencil this compact little darling couldn't handle...so far.  I'm planning on extending my repertoire of colored pencil & graphite pencils, so I may update if I discover any others which don't 'play nice' with this sharpener.  It was just under $8 from the seller I chose at the time I ordered it.  I took the gamble, even though I thought something this small shouldn't cost so much-but I'm glad I did, because it's easily worth double that price for convenience, ease of use (of the sharpeners, not the shavings bins)and quality of sharpening.  I didn't even consider removing a star for the slightly clumsy shavings bins because no sharpener I've tried, from the kind put on supply lists for elementary school kids all the way to brand name specific specialty sharpeners, was perfect in this area. They're all messy-that's why there's a shavings catcher in the first place!

So, if you like three in one capability, excellence of blade and angle in sharpening all 3 types of pencils, and versatility for a decent price, this is the pencil sharpener for you!  It even looks sort of 'modern' sitting on your computer desk or wherever you use it, sleek and 'metallic' looking! :)  Hope this review helps y'all decide what to buy-this really is a great product.  I might even get another one...just because!",18,12.92605

11,"I love these pens. I sign legal documents frequently and I like the way these flow. Generally produce a very nice signature with even ink and do not look light as many roller pens do. I also get 100% use out of the ink. They do not dry out and have to be thrown away with half of the ink still in them. They are pricier than the average ink pen but I don't think they ""cost"" that much more given how long they last without drying up. Word of caution this ink does not dry fast on a coated paper just like most gel inks so it will smear on shiny papers. For someone who signs documents frequently 40x a day? Love 'em.",6,5.7847424

What happens:
You run out of ink and replace a cartridge. This causes a nozzle cleaning cycle to run. Nozzles that were working FINE before are now CLOGGED because epson cant figure out how to purge their ink properly. They get gummed up.

Epson's solution? Run another cleaning cycle - which makes the problem WORSE! They can only be fixed by a technician via complicated disassembly that costs more in labor than the darned printer is worth.

This is my second dead epson in one month. They print amazing when they print right but that isn't often enough for the price.

It does everything it's advertised to do.  The slide holders are a little flimsy, but since i read the other reviews I knew I had to handle them gently and then there was no problem. ( I wonder if I could buy replacements if I accidently broke one?)  The fact that you can see the picture before you choose to scan it, is definitely worth the difference in cost as opposed to those that don't.

Spoke with Epson again and was under the impression from my call they were sending me another unit; well they think a simple replacement ink cartridge will do the trick. Customer service is polite but quite honestly clueless. The printer does not print well on either of the units I had. Copier part of this is the same as the printer - bad quality print.

Most of them had terrible sound qualities, and some had an interface that were really hard to figure out and use. These phones from AT&T have lasted a surprisingly long time. Sound quality is good and so is the coverage. The interface is very logic and the design, if that is important to you, is so-so.

39,"This is a great Epson All-In-One inkjet printer and will fit the needs of most users nicely. Epson calls it a ""Small-In-One"" but it's comparable in size to other multi-function inkjets that I've used and no smaller than its competitors like Canon and HP. But it jams in a lot of features while retaining the same compact form factor. It prints, it scans, it faxes (who faxes anymore?), and it connects wirelessly. It also duplexes, which is a very important feature to me, not because of cost, but because of environmental considerations. I want to save paper, and wish every printer supported duplexing. It can print, fax, scan, and copy both sides of a piece of paper automatically through the ADF (automated document feeder) feature. Anything that it scans can be saved to an SD card via the SD card slot on the left side, emailed to you, or saved to the cloud as a PDF or series of JPGs.

I've owned about 10 different printers over the years in various configurations and have done tech support for many others, so I'm fairly experienced with printers. My last printer was a monochrome Samsung laser printer, but I'm long overdue for an upgrade. It wasn't networkable and crinkled my paper half the time. In terms of features and performance to price, I rate this a 4. You know the saying: jack of all trades, master of none.

Setup takes about 20-30 minutes from unboxing, depending on your technical proficiency and how quickly you can remove the ridiculous amounts of blue tape holding all the trays and covers down during shipment (about 20 pieces). A mandatory 7 minute inkhead alignment/calibration phase is a part of that.  Setup is aided by a touchscreen display and it's very intuitive overall. I didn't like the keyboard input. It's like texting on an old-school cellphone. To get to the lowercase letters, you have to cycle through the capital letters first. There really should've been a Shift button added. The only language options are English and French, which is limited. Other printers I've owned had many more languages.

It recognized by mixed mode network with no problems (A/B/G/N), but does not recognize N only networks. I love the freedom of being able to print from anywhere. I don't print often, but when I do, I like not having to connect my printer to my laptop. And more and more, I'm using my iPad and sometimes need to print maps/driving directions or movie tickets. The Epson handles it very well via AP Mode. I printed a few documents from my iPod and iPad and it works flawlessly! This will account probably for 80% of my printing needs. While in AP Mode, you will lose the ability to access the internet. If a pass-thru mode is available where you can still access the internet, I have not yet discovered it.

The paper tray is very limited and feels quite flimsy. It can fit 30 pieces of paper. Because it duplexes, if you're printing double-sided, that's the equivalent of 60 sheets. Still a low sheet count, but for occasionally printing, this is enough. The printer also has a CD printing option, and again, the CD train feels rather flimsy. This is not an option I'll use. Who makes CD/DVD's anymore? Most people I know save to USB stick nowadays.

Scanning works quite well and is very easy. I love this feature! The default dpi is 200, which is quite adequate for most non-professionals and a good trade-off between quality and file size. It's quite handy for archiving copies of forms and bills. It can go up to 4800 dpi for resolution intensive tasks like photo restoration.

Photo printing is very easy as well. When an SD card is inserted, the photo printing interface comes up automatically. It shows a thumbnail view of all your photos and allows you to select photos to print and number of copies. This is great for non-computer people like my mom who takes a lot of photos and instead of emailing them to people, she likes to print them out and snail mail them. Normally, she'd ask me to print several dozen photos and I'd wait for a sale at Walgreens's or CVS when it becomes $.10 or so per print. Otherwise, it's $0.25/print, which quickly adds up. Now I can print photos from home. It would've been nice if Epson included a starter pack of photo paper however.

Overall, a very capable multi-function printer for a home-office or casual printer. For heavy printing, if you don't need all the features of scanning and faxing, I recommend a monochrome laser printer, as the cost of inkjet ink cartridges is exorbitant (around $60-80 to replace all 6 cartridges:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Epson-T277920-Epson-Claria-Photo-HD-277-Standard-capacity-Color-Multi-pack-Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Light-Cyan-Light-Magenta-T277920-Ink/dp/B009KBGU7M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Epson T277920 Epson Claria Photo HD 277 Standard-capacity Color Multi-pack - Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Light Cyan, Light Magenta (T277920) Ink</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Epson-T277120-Epson-Claria-Photo-HD-277-Standard-capacity-Black-Ink-Cartridge-T277120-Ink/dp/B009KBGTMI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Epson T277120 Epson Claria Photo HD 277 Standard-capacity Black Ink Cartridge (T277120) Ink</a>).

40,I bought this pen probably expecting too much.  I was expected it to be more luxurious and more metal pieces but majority of the pen is made out of plastic.  Most of the silver parts except the pen clip are made out of plastic.  The ink cartridges are pretty small probably half the size of a normal ink cartridge I understand they are half the size to fit the battery assembly to light the pen up which is good that they included 3 refills.  However that would only equal half a refill on normal pens.  I think this pen would be fine without a pen cap which goes on the top end of the pen ( the clicking end) especially for pilots and aviators as its just more pieces to fall off for FOD (foreign object debris) but probably put there in case you accidentally turn on your pen and drain all the batteries.  I feel the 4 clicks to go through the complete cycle of extend ink (off) retract ink (off) extend ink (on) retract ink (off) is a little excessive.  I think a simple twist or something to turn on the led would have been better as I have used a pen like that before.,3,6.48402
41,"Not much other to say here than it's quality paper and fine for stuffing boxes with!
EDIT-I'm through the entire 25 pounds. I ship ALOT of products out, and often need to use this paper as filler. Initially I was a little turned off by the fact that there was varying paper weight included (some thinner, some thicker). I ended up actually liking that about 25%-35% of the paper included was a thinner sheet. It allowed me to choose individual paper based upon how much more I needed to stuff. Just a word of warning, you likely won't get a consistent paper weight-but I don't care!",5,5.8013744
42,"I've read some of the more critical reviews on this paper, and respectfully, I'm not sure I can really agree with those. If you are looking for narrow-ruled paper that is heavier than normal and tears well from the tablet, this one, for me, hits all the high notes. I use these all the time at work to make notes, develop content, draw pictures, etc. and have been completely satisfied. I have had no perforation tearing problems: if you just take a moment to pull carefully (and straight), the perforation tears just fine. And the added thickness makes it more pleasurable to use than standard paper, and I've always been a fan of narrow-ruled paper.

Over the years, my wife and I have brought back from Europe paper made in France that is so high quality you can't believe it. That type of paper is, however, the work of artisans who work for companies that have been making paper for hundreds of years, and the texture, composition, and cut is something you have to experience firsthand to appreciate. These TOPS tablets are not attempting to reach that level, nor should they be, or they would be running about $150 or more for this set. But what you DO have here is very good quality paper with a moderate texture feel that is thick and useful, and at a reasonable cost. Understanding what this paper is--and what it is NOT--is the key to appreciating it! I rate it five stars.",2,10.600455
43,"Okay for our purpose.  Surface not smooth, does not ""scoot"" in file drawer easily.",3,2.7210891
44,"I have an older vehicle with a plastic piece of trim that goes around the bottom of the drivers seat. I've been unable to find a replacement even from the dealer. Short of getting lucky on eBay I thought I was out of luck until I found Bondic. It was just what I needed to bond the cracks and also rebuild the surface that held the rear screw in place. From experience I knew from experience the various putty and epoxies wouldn't work on this plastic. They would either crack or simply not bond properly and fall off.  I finally had time to try Bondic and it worked perfectly. The photos really tell the story. Basically, I was able to rebuild and reattach the piece without a problem. Although you can still see where the cracks where, they are solid as can be. The platic on that second screw was completely broken off and had to be reattached with the Bondic. The Bondic saved me a lot of time and money.",26,5.842129
45,The weight of this paper makes it suitable for greeting cards.  I do not get any bleed through from the other side when I do double sided printing.  I have found that it works just as well with the Canon as with my old Epson.  The colors seem to hold true to my expectations.  I recommend it's use.,7,3.4082186
46,"Update 1/4/18: 1 star to 3 stars.

Contacted them for a replacement about 10.5 months after purchasing the original. Completely forgot about the defective toner (birth of new baby), until late Xmas eve when I ran out of name tags and went to print more...result was a streaky nasty mess.

They sent me a replacement without any issue (highly commend them for that!). Received it today, did a few test prints, so far so good. Only time will tell though!

After a few uses, started to streak and have poor print quality. Tried all the tricks to improve it, but never lasted. Junk quality, get what you pay for I guess. Back to the branded toner for me",3,4.920434
47,Great quality at a great price.  Best of all my old eyes can actually see the numbers.  I keep it next to the phone. I hate to do long division in my head while I'm on the phone.  Heck I hate it all the time.,3,3.084901
48,"So, I bought one of the wall control kits, and this extra hook assortment.

For what you're paying here you'll probably expect a higher quality kit, but unfortunately what you end up with misses the mark. The panels themselves are nice and sturdy, and the steel look is nice as well, but the hooks themselves leave a lot to be desired.

The hooks are loose, and their makeshift solution to this - which appears to have occurred after the fact - is to take what amounts to an o-ring and put it behind the hook, which just serves to reduce the gap so the hooks don't move as much, but the fact of the matter is that they do still move.

I'd recommend that you save your money on this one and just go with a traditional pegboard and hooks, unless you're more concerned about aesthetics then you are functionality.",2,4.595741
49,"I am a fan of Blue Black ink. This one is a nice color and flows and drys well. While I like it don't love it. I am still searching for the perfect blue black ink which I think is a worthy endeavor. What really attracts me to Noodler's Ink in many cases are the stories behind the inks. This was my first Noodler's ink purchase. There will be more.

The story behind this ink caught my attention. This ink draws its name from the first all black regiment to fight in the civil war. I love that Noodler's will draw from history for some its ink names.",2,5.4492087
50,"These bags are extremely thin and rip just trying to open the bag.  Not even good enough for a trash can, no less a shredder basket.  I switched back to just normal trash bags after just using 2 bags because they only ripped opened and then I had to use another bag anyway.",37,3.9623127
51,"It's a lot smaller than I wanted, but for the price, it is about the right weight for its size.  I just wanted bigger but that would have made it a bargain.  It has an obvious seam right down the middle...as if you could cut the dog in equal halves right from head to tail down the back.  The bottom seam is split and not welded solid, so craftmanship is...""what craftmanship?!""  Outside of that it feels pretty solid for two halves put together. It is an economical decorative.  If you compare the prices of some ""resins"" which don't even have much weight to be a doorstop, they are ridiculously overprice.  This could be a doorstop or a lovely garden statuary and not blow away or be knocked over easily.",5,7.3133826
52,"I enjoy using gel pens and what I like most about this set is the great variety of colors as well as their high quality. There are lots of blue hues, reds and purples, browns and greens, yellows, even grays and black. The metallics are nice and rich in color and the glitter pens work well with no plug ups as their tips are a little larger. The neons really pop! These pens offer great coverage without any light spots when using. Writing is very smooth with these and the flow of ink is exceptional. The pens are comfortable to hold as each pen has its own special grip.

The caddy is nice to keep them organized and stored. I find that the caddy is just a tad unstable, but not to a point it will spill the pens, it's just a little wobbly but it rotates so you can pick whichever colors you'd like easily and quickly. My daughter put the pens in rainbow order and this makes it easy to pick out the right color.

I have had some sets of pens where there are usually several pens that just won't work no matter what you do to the tips, but I've not experienced any problems with this set. Each pen works well and the colors are vibrant and rich and offer great coverage. There really is a nice assortment of great colors in this set with a variety of metallics, glitters, pastels and normal gel pens. These are perfect for art, doodling, cards and general writing. Love them!",2,10.26283
53,"With so many travel vacations planned, I really needed a small notebook where I could write down important information/memories I would like to keep track of, that could hold various small documents, and could hold a pen to write everything down with.  The Geotel Notebook is a nice sized travel journal and document holder.  The journal is about half the size of a standard 8.5x11 notebook, is well stitched, and has a few small pockets to hold various tickets and documents, as well as a spot to hold a pen to jot everything down with.  The outside of the notebook is made from canvas and cardboard, and the interior notebook is removable, so you can put a new one in once the notebook is completely filled.  The holder has a small band on it to keep everything shut, and the interior notebook comes with a small matching bookmark.  The interior notebook paper is in grid form, which I'm not totally thrilled with, but it does the job.

While I like the notebook, I'm hard pressed to say that it's worth it at the $30 price point.  While the canvas holder is sound, it's still just canvas on cardboard.  It's very casual looking, but not something I would want to bring to work with me.  Also, because the notebook is half paper sized, you can't use it to carry documents you don't want to fold in half.  Lastly, the interior notebook is a size that's not necessarily easy to find a replacement for.  I personally don't like grid style paper and would have preferred simply lined paper - this is a notebook I'm having a hard time finding a replacement for.

Overall, if you're totally into the canvas look, this isn't a bad notebook to consider - but there are a lot of other more durable and nicer looking options out there.

FYI - I was selected for this opportunity to review this item free of charge. The content and opinions expressed here are all my own.",2,13.291235
54,"We have bought two of these so far for family members! I work at a Head Start as a Preschool teacher so this is just what I needed to transfer papers between home and work. It won't totally protect your papers from the rain, but so far my papers haven't gotten wet. It's easy to carry, opens and closes nicely, and can fit a lot of papers in it.",2,5.1825256
55,"For a large, it's a little on the small size. The actual printed ink mark measures 2"" x 1/2"". I was hoping for a little bigger. But it works every time (used over 100 times in one day already), and the ink is a good dark rich color. Doesn't look like a cheap print, just wish it was actually ""large"".",6,7.690176
56,"There are many types of letter openers in the world, but I am partial to this model, with its rosewood handle and sharp blade.  It is a pleasure to use, slices envelopes open well when angled properly, is easy to store, holds its edge and does exactly what it was intended to do. As Louis Sullivan said (quoted by Wikipedia), ""Whether it be the sweeping eagle in his flight, or the open apple-blossom, the toiling work-horse, the blithe swan, the branching oak, the winding stream at its base, the drifting clouds, over all the coursing sun, form ever follows function, and this is the law. Where function does not change, form does not change. The granite rocks, the ever-brooding hills, remain for ages; the lightning lives, comes into shape, and dies, in a twinkling.""  He didn't include rosewood-handled letter openers in his litany, but he could have.  Something about the rosewood speaks of blithe swans and branching oaks, at least to me.  Little objects like this enhance daily life.  There is no reason the utilitarian cannot also be artistic.",2,10.162289

58,"While this chalk definitely creates less dust - it manages this feat by being much harder than most chalk. It's nice in that you can create finer lines and more detail with less ""bleeding"" by the thicker, dustier lines most chalk creates.  However, for our challboard painted door, it seems to be scratching the door up. Maybe if our door was painted *more* than 2 months ago, it would be cured to a harder finish.  But as it stands, it is not working out the best for our purposes. It also breaks easily (in hand or if dropped on to carpet.)  I appreciate that this could work well in a school setting or with a standard chalkboard. But for name brand popular chalkboard painted surfaces - you might think twice.",54,7.345599

60,"I have no idea how well this works for its intended use but given what I put it through, I would guess it will do great. My Topsiders have a padded plastic insole with a piece of leather covering it. After about a season of wearing them in the heat and sockless, this leather piece begins to detach. I have tried everything, including a number of Gorilla solutions, to correct this and 3M's tape is the first product that worked. It's lasted all summer under my sweaty soles and it's still solid.",2,4.1939244
61,"These are adorable, and seem to be holding out quite well as far as sturdiness goes. Just wish there was more than 12 for this price. Product = Decent; Price = Not Really Worth it. I got these for a co worker who loves cats, and of course she LOVES them.",3,3.6474001

64,"I've owned a Fiskars personal size paper cutter for quite a few years, and have never had trouble finding replacement blades. This time, it was a challenge, because I guess Fiskars makes more than 1 type of blade now. My paper cutter model is old enough that it did NOT say the type of blade I need on the back. I looked carefully at the pictures, and ordered this type.
This DOES fit my older-model, BUT is not as good of quality as the usual Fiskars products. First, the little finger-hold spot to slide the blades almost non-existent. There's barely anything there to pinch, and I even have TINY hands. Second, the blade encasement keeps popping out of the blade slide, which is both dangerous and annoying.
I'm wondering if this crappy-quality replacement part for the older model is Fiskars' way of trying to get me to buy the newer model. Kinda feels like it.
So, in all, this replacement blade works, but it is slower and frustrating.",23,6.8165655
65,"I asked about the thinkness of the paper and was told not to expect too much. I was not sure aboout bleed and feathering. I collect fountain pens and do some mixing of inks. I tried Watermann Red, a custom ""blackcherry"", doctored Parker black, Lamy Blue. Red was in a Preppy F, Blackcherry in TWSBI XF, Black in Preppy XF, Lamy XF.None feathered except possibly the Parker, and it was VERY minimal. The only one the came close to bleeding again was the Parker, and it was only a darker shadow.",7,6.18352
66,"These work great with my Leuchtturm1917 notebook, and have much less bleed through and ghosting than gel pens. The pictures below are from that notebook. I also have some samples of the medium point versions of these pens as well.

Update 1/23/17: As I've used these more, the tip seems to have flared out  more. The pen still writes well, although it now has a much bolder line. Black and magenta are two pens I've used more frequently, and you can see how they are a bit thicker in the attached images.

Update 5/24/17: The thicker line really bugged me, so I moved to another pen. The extra ink they started laying down made ghosting worse unfortunately.",28,7.8735404

I, myself have used Faultless clips for over thirty years.  Do not be hoodwinked by these counterfeit clips.  If you search Amazon or eBay for Faultless Clips you will see an ad for twelve of the genuine clips for about $16, along with a picture of the genuine clips.  Note the spherical clip end on the genuine Faultless clips and compare it with the picture of these counterfeit clips in this ad.  The inferior Chinese clips are almost guaranteed to tear a hole in your pocket with the sharp end, and in addition the mild steel that the Chinese use to make the clips will not hold up or spring properly.",17,8.553636
68,"Exactly what I was needing and expecting.  Had no problems with printing after designing on the Avery website.

As for the question of whether they are perforated or not:  The labels I received are not perforated. However, there is a slit cut in the paper backing behind each label to make them easier to peel off. This slit makes them appear perforated when you are looking at the sheet in the photo, and even when I got mine and saw them in person I thought they were perforated until I peeled one off something I had stuck it to and realized it wasn't.",4,5.2369127

72,"First, a few things that could be better - this tape is currently a bit pricey, and we haven't found a way to write on it.

With that said, though, my eight year old still demands that I give it five stars.  She's a paper and tape craft-head, and has been making dragons, new clothes for her dolls, doll accessories, furniture, and more.  She couldn't be any happier, and has no complaints.

This is basically like regular Scotch ""magic"" tape, but colored.  I think it would be good for crafts, scrapbooking, and general decoration, and recommend it if it meets your needs, or if you're looking for a stocking stuffer for a crafty youngster.",2,4.910938
73,"I'm certain these cartridges and the ink they contain would be fine if, indeed, they fit my pens which use the standard international size cartridge of about 1 1/2 inches in length.  These are NOT standard international size but are longer in length.  Apparently there are two different lengths of ""international"" sized cartridges, the longer of which (these) I had never seen before.  It cost me more that half the price of these cartridges to make this mistake and pay the return shipping.  If I had looked closely at the photo I could have avoided donating $5.00 to the USPS.",30,8.763636
74,"Do not waste your money, I was excited to find this product because it appeared to have many reds, and it's hard to find a true red pencil but while there are reds I can't use some of them because every time I sharpen them the lead falls out.  I can't sharpen any of them to a point, if I get a point it breaks off the minute I put it to paper.  I have probably 20 that I haven't used even once because they broke, I sharpened and have sharpened over and over to find a way to use it, and the color just falls out.  They don't blend well but was hopeful they would work out for my needs, I wish I had spent a little more money and bought the better pencils.  The frustration of trying to use them and they break, is not worth the headaches.  to be clear as well, it's not my sharpener, I have used 3 different ones that are all great on my other pencils, the problem is the pencils.

There are multiple duplicates, although the pencil colors are vastly different.  You can not trust the color on the pencil wood at all, I have a few that are supposed to be light pink and color purple, it's that way with all of them, don't trust the color of the wood.  I think they change the outside color and use the same wax color inside.  If you still decide to purchase this, just be aware that you will be frustrated and irritated if you plan to use them often.  Lastly, when they arrived, they smelled horrible, I've never had pencils smell like that, it was terrible, I had to leave them out for a couple of days before the smell went away, so if you have that problem remove them from the box and discard the box, as it smells just as bad.  Good luck if you buy them, I will never purchase this brand again",9,7.983921

79,"This unit is expensive and acts like it's too good to be a shredder.  It's too sensitive to shred 5 or more sheets of paper at once. It acts like junk mail is beneath it so shredding junk mail takes extra effort; you have to tear paper so it's more palpable for this cantankerous unit. It works slowly. The bag gets full way too fast rather the machine stops functioning because it's on a diet and can't tolerate being well fed.  It stops working like it's time for a lunch break or it has executive hours. So you have to wait for the unit to cool down before you can resume your tasks of feeding it baby bite size pieces (less than 5 sheets of paper at a time). The bag which is a must for this unit; yet, it still allows shredded paper to fall to the base of the unit which means confetti for the floor each time the bag is changed too frequently. The size of the unit is smaller than I expected; it appears to be larger on the picture online.  If size matters then you need to review the specs to determine if this one will accommodate your needs. On a positive note, this is definitely a safe shredder. Assembly is required. The wheels can be a challenge to connect if you're not handy.  It's not as noisy as other shredders that I have had. The unit has a lot of bells and whistles but not much functionality.

It is a lot bigger than I expected, but I can't complain. It prints super fast, has great economy print features, and I love that to print double-sided it flips the pages for you. I got an extra black ink when I got the printer, but I still got tons of original ink, despite having printed a lot of pages. So the original ink supply is very decent! Scanning feature is amazing too--easily scanned a page to USB device, automatically converted to PDF. All in all, this printer has a ton of features that I haven't even explored. You can supposedly print to it even when you are far away from the device. Printing from iPhone doesn't give you a lot of customized options--only to choose page numbers and double-sided or not.

92,"Had Casio been upfront with us, the consumer, I would not have purchased this calculator.  Amazon's quote from ""Manufacturer's Product Description"" (nor other websites of other sellers) does not mention the following shortcomings of this calculator.

While this calculator can indeed graph, it  does not support natural, or textbook I/O (input/output) and as such is not as functional as the less expensive Casio fx-ES115ES, which does support Natural I/O (input/output), and will give correct answers every-time.  This fx-9750GII calculator more often than not will give only decimal approximations instead of the ultimate correct fractional answer, when applicable.  This is especially inconvenient when one wants to compare results during a test, or while solving problems from a mathematical text book, all of which expect correct answers, and not decimal approximations.  For example, the square root of 8 is shown as 2.82842725, instead of the correct answer of 2*(Sq. Root of 2); this shortcoming affects also results when solving Calculus problems.  Working with mixed numbers is also a pain;  their fx-115ES made this so easy, with natural I/O.

A better, but more expensive choice would have been the Casio fx-9860GII calculator, which does support natural I/O. A superior HP 50G cost very little more, and has SD capability.  I purchased the Casio calculator mainly because I was familiar with the fx-115ES already.

I contacted Casio twice to voice may displeasure with this calculator, however, I was ignored each time.  They appear not to care that customers, expecting a calculator at least as capable as their lesser expensive one, find out only after their purchase, that they bought the wrong calculator; this is not acceptable.

Amazon should contact Casio to make them provide complete product description, and then share it on their website; buyers have a right to know",80,14.603164

94,"I still do some phone work and wanted to label some patch panels and some cords.

This unit has the ability to put icons (like a phone and a Bunnie) on the labels.

That said the instructions for inserting the icons were MADDENING.

I finally figured out that you have to type in things like A3 then something then F4 to get what you want.

Maybe someone else could figure out those specific instructions better than me.

The hardware was fine, it was only the icon instructions that were so bizarre.

And of course, all Brother PT machines come set to waste as much tape as possible before and after what you want to print and you have to figure out how to cut out that waste.

Good machine, just frustrating. I always hit the cutter as soon as I see the label is out. The machine says ""Cutter Error."" I push any button and the message goes away and I haven't wasted a half inch of tape.

97,"When I got this, I thought it was a laser printer.  When I saw the pages, I thought it was a laser printer.  It wasn't until the ink ran out that I realized it was not a laser printer.  That is a good thing, as the replacement ink for this is much cheaper to buy and operate than for a laser printer.  I thought I wanted laser, but it turns out that I made a mistake that worked in my favor (for once).  I guess a trained eye could tell the difference, but for someone like me who just wants something printed, this fills the bill.

This printer has tons of capabilities and features. I won't bore you with re-iterating them here, but there are a few key points I will make, based on my opinion:

(1) Great deal for the money
(2) Super simple (and fast) set-up
(3) Great quality printing - definitely rivals laser
(4) Wish the ink were a little more high capacity
(5) Tons of features.

You can't go wrong with this one.",6,6.913292
98,"I have used the Scotch brand packaging tape dispenser and tape for years and I love it. It is easy to use, you can do it one handed, and once they are taped they don't come open until you cut them open.
I have used the tape to repair things like a broken center pole on my Christmas tree, that was several years ago and it is still holding.
I also ship on Ebay and use this tape to close the boxes and tape on the labels. I tape over the address section of the labels so they do not smear if they get wet plus it closes those boxes tightly and they do not come open during mailing.
In a pinch, I have also cut small strips and used it to tape wrapping paper on Christmas presents.

I ordered this pack of certificates and when they are open and in your hand, look just as professional as the $15.00 certificates I had previously bought.  I like the fact that there is a template available to use so that you can type and print your certificates from your computer to your home printer.

My eyes caught on the words ""heavyweight"" and ""resists bleed through"" and I went ahead and made the purchase.  16lb is not ""heavy"" paper in my opinion.  I feel 20lb is a medium weight paper, and 28lb+ gets into the nice, heavyweight category.  This paper feels a bit flimsy to me.  While the ink doesn't technically bleed through (or feather much on the paper, so that's a plus) you can see the ink on the reverse side (both ballpoint ink & rollerball).  Bottom line:  this paper is for one-sided-use only.  Not worth returning, but I'll be looking for something different next time.

I was in heaven!  I felt like I was sitting up much straighter in my seat and not slouching. This cushion is pliable, not too warm, easy to sit on and I didn't have the issue of ""falling off"" it when I went around corners like I had with the usual ""wedge"" pillow form.

From time to time, you can sift to the bottom with your left hand and kind of pull the coins forward in order to have the coins edges face upward, and it will run smoothly as can be. It's easy to unload the coin tubes and slip the sleeve over the coins, etc. It's quite fun to use, and the quality is pretty darn good for what you pay for.

119,"This replaced a workhorse, great and reliable MP 530, which was NOT top of product line when I bought it about 6 yrs ago. Yet the 530 had features that are NOT present, to my surprise, on the MX892, which was top of line when I bought it 6 mos ago.  Feature I miss the most is that my old Canon would auto switch mid printing to second tray if first one ran out of paper. The 892 does NOT (I tried to find it...).

BUT picture quality is AMAZING, when using Canon papers, even in std (vs hq) mode. Better than my previous HP, Epson (just 2 yrs old) or even the old Canons that died on me this yr (MP530 and ip4200).

I too was hoping for touch screen; and I do not find the layout and ease of use of the control panel (buttons) to be intuitive...except for the CODED DIAL button...essential (lower priced Canon MX432 does not have it).  Would prefer to be able to input # copies vs using up/down arrows, for ex.

BUT it just works and well! Text printing is very good, even for me in fast mode.

Wireless is a WONDER! Set up on Macs was easy; less so on WIn 7 machines, though. iPrint/air print is great, though I wish it was possible to print from iPhone in fast quality (greyed out for some reason).

Final quibble: ink prices and volume in cartridges: while price is comparable for the 225/226 carts this printer needs, to 5's and 8's my last Canon needed, I noticed that the # of MLs in these carts is 9 ML vs 14-15 ml's on the older ones. That MUST mean higher cost per page, no?

Have solved by getting refilled at Costco for $8-9 vs 14/15 at stores or even AMZ. Seems to last at least as long and have used 7-8 by now w/o a single problem (uh oh).

REALLY learned my lesson getting a deal (!) on Epson WF printer in between. Its wireless worked ok, text printing fine, but photo printing doesn't compare and for about the same price as this Canon, did NOT get duplex printing or scanning with the Epson WF 630 (which itself was a replacement for a jamming 620). And while bigger, the Canon is relatively quieter.

Go slow on set up, consider Costco ink refills and enjoy this printer.",2,12.155999
120,"I run a small business on the side, making a very specialized piece of tooling for sportsmen.  Because this tool is a rather unique item, I do all but a very small fraction of my transactions via the internet.  This, of course, means that nearly every item I sell has to be shipped.  Prior to purchasing the QL-570, this meant that each item went into a padded bubble mailer, an address label went on, then I had to use an Avery template in Word to create the destination address for printing on my inkjet.  Of course, since I only used one or two address labels at a time, I had to keep track of which parts of the 40-label sheet I had used and which ones I had not.  After shipping 80+ items, this was getting to be a real hassle, and some improvement was definitely called for.

Enter the Internet.  A reasonably extensive search indicated that the best solution to my shipping aggravation would be a dedicated thermal printer, running off of pre-cut address labels.  To save time, I wanted to be able to use a die-cut blank large enough that I could print my return address, the destination address and perhaps a small business logo, all at the same time.  Two front-runners quickly appeared in the <$100 range that I considered affordable for the quantity of business I would be using the unit for.  This Brother and one well-reviewed Dimo entry showed about equally for customer satisfaction, and after looking around town for the availability of supplies I decided on the Brother.

Upon receipt of the unit, I opened the box to find a well-packaged printer, the requisite cords for power and attachment, a software CD and manual, and two sample-sized rolls of media, just as the advertisement specified.  The software installed very easily, and in ""Professional"" mode very quickly allowed me to insert the .PNG graphic I had created in Photoshop to be my business' logo, add a good-looking boarder, and set up a field I could easily paste the address into from the Excel spreadsheet that I keep my customer information logged in.  I did not find the software cumbersome or clunky, although I am definitely not the most ""artistic"" person, so a user with a more demanding requirement might.  While the printer was in shipment, I purchased a roll of the large-size shipping labels from a local office-supply store.  As promised, I dropped them into the unit and it automatically adjusted and resized everything for the new media without any input from me at all.  It took perhaps ten minutes, including time to install and poke at the software, from unboxing to the first finished label suitable to go on a product.

Print quality is very good, as I would expect from thermal process, and the print speed has to be seen to be believed.  The automatic cutter (which I have set to 'cut every 1 label(s)' works quickly and efficiently.  One minor quibble I have with it is that the little pull-down catcher tray on the front is somewhat useless.  The cutter works very briskly, and the finished labels tend to fly a rather impressive distance, for me in excess of six inches from the front of the printer.  I was aware that this might occur from another review, so I was prepared for it and have it sitting it on my desk where the errant fliers will not escape down a crack or behind the desk.  This is more of a quibble than an actual problem, perhaps something to address in the next iteration of the printer.

Overall, the QL-570 exceeded my expectations in every way, and has made my shipping much faster and simpler.  If you do any amount of E-commerce, I would very highly recommend it, it will simplify your life.",8,9.317899

Some of the locking screws do not perfectly slip in and checking the line up in the hole with a loose locking screw solved the issue almost every time. A few required jiggling the two parts being connected before all screws went fully in. It was fine. Just a note for anyone.

Also, I checked the first two castors to see if they were locking and assumed they all were. Only two are.  On rechecking, the instruction PICTURES clearly show that locking go in the front and free go in the back. I accidentally ignored the placement, thinking they were all locking.

126,"I recently decided to do some preschool activities at home and needed a laminator.  After using this one, I am laminating obsessed!  Here are the pros:

: Compact - it does not take up very much space
: Cord: it neatly winds around the back of the machine and hooks onto itself
: Quiet and quick
: Nice carrying handle for transporting/moving around the house
: No jams - I have laminated over 30 sheets in the last two days and have not had any problems with jamming

The machine takes three to five minutes to warm up and about a minute or so to laminate each sheet.  You definitely want to center the sheets before you send them through so that the edges don't get crunched (I mistakenly lined up the sheet to the edge of machine thinking it would guide it through better but I think centering is the way to go).

I have used other brands of laminating pouches (cheaper than Fellowes) and have not had any problem so I recommend doing that.

The only reason I did not give this machine 5 stars is because after the laminated sheet passes through the machine, the bottom of the page stays resting on the machine.  If you do not remove the paper right away, it sits by the heat and can cause the paper to curl a little.  I wish the paper would automatically drop to the table top or move itself away from the heat so that I did not have to think about immediate removal.",4,6.453774
127,"First off, I give this 4 stars instead of 5 for a couple of reasons.  The main one being that (as another reviewer mentioned) this is not a fine-point, but more along the lines of a medium.  That's kind of a big deal if you plan on achieving the hairline thins along with the flex thick shaded lines.  Nonetheless, if you will be happy with a medium point, you'll probably be pleasantly surprised with this pen.  First, be sure to soak the thing in some lightly soapy water to wash off the oils...I failed to do this, and ink ""fisheyed"" all over the metal.  It also wrote poorly, often railroading lines, and every sentence or two, it would drop a big blob of ink suddenly when I flexed the nib.  I knew about the oils and saw the crawling of the ink on the nib, so I soaked it a good 30 minutes.  Water and Dawn dishwashing liquid, and a little bit of amonia too.  Also, I read that the ebonite is full of grains and specks from the milling/cutting of the ebonite (at least mine was).  It really is best to dismantle the nib from the pen completely and soak the parts in a bowl while they are separated.  (Don't be afraid to do this, it's really no big deal at all).  Swish around the ebonite and you will have several small granules of the stuff at the bottom of your bowl.  I found out that those little things will wreak havoc on your ink flow.  Once I got all that out of there and adjusted the position of the ebonite to the metal nib, things started really improving with the Ahab.  Don't be afraid to adjust (I had never done it before).  I just used trial and error.  The whole things just pulls out of the front of the pen...nib and ebonite.  It's a friction-fit, so all you do is just jam it back in there with the nib-and-ebonite positioned differently in relation to each other.  Ebonite closer to the point of the nib is wetter...farther back from the point is dryer.  It really wasn't rocket science, and I needed ""wetter"" because of constant railroading and skips and losing prime.  Really was frustrating.  Once I got that dialed in, hey...pretty damn good after all!  And now the pen seems to be getting even better, maybe going through a ""break-in"" period or something?  So I downloaded some nice spencerian-ish texts from the 'net, and started the process of learning to flex the nib to achieve the thick and thin lines (I have been a broad point user forever, so flex nib is a new field for me).  Anywayzee...after a few weeks, I got the pen working well, and I have begun to get some decent results from my flex technique.  Just remember, this will start out as a med point line, not a fine line.  Best results are not to flex too hard on this.  To me, it's kind of stiff and requires too much pressure.  So I flex more lightly, and have found that my alphabets are looking pretty good!  OK, enough about that...if you (like me) want to give the flex-nib a try, this is probably a good one to mess with due to the price.  Once I sharpen up, I'll look at those Nakimi Falcons, but no use for me to invest $150 until I kind of know what I'm doing.  A hell of a nice price on a decent little pen.  Super easy to adjust, just be sure you clean it very well to avoid frustrations.  And if it's too wet or too dry, adjust it...hell it's easy and you won't mess anything up unless you really force or bungle things.  :-)",50,9.594146
128,"This reviewer played around for some years with fountain pens. I love'em, and I think they are an avenue to rescue the fine art of penmanship and personal notes. But they're impractical for daily work at high volume.

The Pilot Varsity Disposable Fountain Pen makes a middle aground accessible: you can get near fountain-pen quality without the complications of an ink well. I'd say you can get 75% of the way to beautiful writing with this pen.

I experience only two downsides. First, the ink does not flow quickly upon first writing. Sometimes substantial 'warming up' is required. Second, over the approximately four orders I've for these pens, the quality has been uneven. One of the orders, if it was in fact the legitimate item, had significant quality-control issues.

Everything I print on looks great. No issues. I do not like the canon software. With this baby I can print photos and it looks way better than walgreens or walmart photo service.

Now for the reason I chose this one.....the INK! I got 5 refills of EVERY color for $18.95!!!!! I have printed hundreds of photos anywhere from wallet, 3x5, 4x6, 5x7, 8x10, 8.5x11.5, 13x19.

The paper actually feeds into the printer properly it takes 1 piece of paper unlike many other printers that will pull No paper or 3 or 4 sheets at a time. It is wireless and does not have a touch screen.

IT IS NOT AN ALL IN ONE. People are knocking the rating down for this when it clearly states its only a printer, It WILL NOT SCAN or fax or anything else but print but its the best printer I have ever used.

Check out the aftermarket ink it does a wonderful job and you can get refills for under 4 bucks for a complete refill!!! How can you beat that!!!",4,8.499334

This one fit the bill perfectly, and for about $125 less.

The unit consists of a sturdy metal frame holding a plastic keyboard tray. The drawer rolls smoothly on ball bearing slides. Metal frame hold my monitor with no bending or flexing of it of any kind. The tray is only wide enough for keyboard and is not designed to hold a mouse.

Theres only one thing negative I have to say about this keyboard tray. When you slide the tray all the way out little metal prongs pop out lock the tray in the fully extended position. You have to push them in simultaneously to unlock the drawer to slide it back in. Some people may like this feature, but I personally find it to be a bit of a pain in the butt.

136,"I saw the mixed reviews about poor quality and ink spills regarding these. But, the ink spill stories seem too fantastic to be authentic. However, some were quite amusing. Anyway, I occasionally take a risk with a bargain whenever the negatives are adequately suspicious. This was one of those.

These refilled (not re-manufactured) cartridges were packaged extremely well. Both the main ink outlet and the ventilation hole were sealed well, secured with shrink wrap, and then sealed in individual, tough, plastic bags for three levels of protection against spillage and premature drying.

I was in the middle of printing a graphic design project (a professional brochure) when it came time to replace my factory-direct cartridges. I thought to myself, even if the quality is good, there may be a noticeable difference from brochure-to-brochure using different ink suppliers. But, I went ahead with popping in the refilled cartridges and kept on printing. I received several warnings at first about using the refills, which was expected. However, I am an experienced printer of professional publications with a discerning eye for print color and I could not detect any difference using the refilled cartridges.

I will point out that the colored tabs meant to secure the cartridge in the print-head cradle were relaxed in a folded-in position, causing them to not function. However, I pulled each cartridge back out, held the tab in an extended position for a few seconds, and then the cartridge would snap securely into the print-head cradle.

No, I didn't experience any exploding ink, splatter, or even a small drip. Perhaps some impatient consumers did not read the bold instruction written directly on the pull-tab that says, ""Remove Tape Slowly"". Various chemicals change in volume over time, especially after being freshly mixed together with other chemicals. In a tightly sealed environment, such as these cartridges as they are shipped, that results in a build-up of pressure or vacuum. Either one may cause a small spit when breaking the inner seal. The seal is obviously designed to balance the pressure or vacuum in a controlled manner, but only if you follow the directions.

I will post an update if after reaching a certain age the ink decides to crawl out of my printer, find my bedroom, slither into my dresser, and splatter all of my whites and light-colored clothing. Cheers!",15,9.996975

138,"I home-school my 7 year old daughter and we are always in need of a good eraser. The little ones at the end of pencils either get used up well before the pencil is near the end of use or they fall out. Hand held erasers are just more convenient to use, plus they cover a larger area. The Colorolio eraser fits comfortably in my hand as well as my daughter's. It erases well and is brightly colored so it won't get lost easily. I made pencil lines of varying darkness and had no issue with erasing all but the darkest line, which was made by pressing down much harder than anyone would normally do anyway. It does seem to lose a fair amount shavings on the paper though. There is no smell to the eraser and it doesn't leave any color behind like another brand of pink erasers we have.

The pictures show how well I was able to erase each line by going over them one by one with the Colorolio eraser a total of 5 times per line. One picture shows the amount of eraser shavings left after doing so. I did have to go over some of the lines a few more times to get them to erase better, which increased the number of shavings (not pictured). I also included a picture of the pencil I used.

140,"These banner stands are fairly inexpensive. I put together a lot of banners for seminars and trade shows and while these aren't the most sturdy stands, they're great for a couple of uses. My biggest complaint would be the little rod that holds the banner up. It's got a twist-lock mechanism. It's nice, but a little overkill for a banner stand and just makes for a bulkier package. It's a small quibble and not worth losing a star over. It's nice, just not really necessary.

Otherwise, these things are great. I've bout about 8 of them and plan to keep buying them as I need them.

147,"On a certain level ink is ink - how much more can you say about it?  There certainly are questions of durability, strength, permanence (also known as washability), and the tendency to bleed through a typical sheet of paper.  On those counts Sheaffer Skrip is outstanding, especially in terms of durability and strength.  What I particularly like about Sheaffer's Skrip is that it is less likely to bleed through a sheet of paper to show on the other side.  As far as washability/permanence goes, both brands can be got out by pre-treating with Simple Green or hairspray (or both).  Better still, Skrip works fine in my Sheaffer cartridge style fountain pens, but also some of the later production Esterbrook fountain pens.  And more importantly Skrip is available in a far wider variety of colors than other cartridge-style pens (and their own bottled ink!) including turquoise, purple, orange, green, and brown.  This gives writers a broader palate to express themselves, something to think about if you like writing with a little flair!  While that won't likely lead to a renaissance of fountain pens, it certainly could liven up your daily writing.

This monochrome duplexing printing unit take care of 2 sided output nicely and automatically. The print quality is excellent on they type of typical office output being printed.

The network scanner performs well in both grey scale and color. The automatic feeder has not misfed on us yet - which is unusual here. The ability to trigger a scan to PC is simple and intuitive. The driver installation sets up and registers the PC with the multifunction, so that PC is in the scanner send-to menu. Nice!

The FAX function is on a dedicated line. The use is intuitive, automatic, and works really well. Since setting up the FAX it just works - what we would like to see and we have not particularlt thought of it since setting it up.

The copier is like the FAX but without the setup. It simply works well and reasonably quickly, especially if multiple copies of an original set of documents is needed.

This Brother 8480DN replaced a little bit older HP. One of the things that is REALLY nice is how the only software installed with the setup is related to the printer directly. This is very different from the previous HP unit, only a few years old. That HP B&W laser multifunction took the better part of an hour to do the default installation. The HP installed lots junkware with a bloated installation process. Once we removed the HP software, which took as long as the install, it was like getting a new PC; they noticibly sped up.

First the good: it lays down a nice thick line of ink and doesn't have any significant problems with skipping or dry starts, etc. etc. Although the nib is a fine, it's closer to a medium in my experience. Also, contra to the Q&A for the product, it does come pre-loaded with a converter so one can use bottled ink.

Now the bad: this pen looks and feels super super cheap. It is extremely lightweight, the cap does not stay in place once posted, and the plastic barrel scratches immediately. The grip is extremely slick and narrow, making the pen extremely difficult to write with. The edge where the barrel meets the cap is very sharp, increasing the discomfort of writing.

In sum, I gave the pen a three star rating because the nib itself produces a great written line and the converter is included. However, everything else about this pen is very much a one star. Paper for sample image is Maruman Mnemosyne and ink is Pelikan 4001 Violet)",22,10.952757

164,"Parents: If you're going to buy your child a graphing calculator for school, DON'T insult his/her intelligence with this limited function calculator. Go with a TI-86 or TI-89 as it will serve him/her well through into college. What this means is you save money by purchasing one calculator that will be useful for SATs, GREs, AP tests, high school, algebra, calculus 1-3, college, etc...

If you buy a TI-83, you will have to get a TI-86 or TI-89 in the future because a TI-83 is an OVERGLORIFIED TI-82, which is really good for pre-algebra and algebra.

GRANTED you can use a TI-83 for Calculus and more advanced math, but it's a good idea to allow your child to grow intellectually by learning how to use a much more advanced calculator for Calc II and III. I had no problems using a TI-86 for Calc 2 and 3, but the TI-89 definitely helped me understand theorems that were in 3 dimensions.

For those who are looking for a calculator to use at work:
The TI-83 is a piece of junk. It's for kiddies in 6th grade.

The TI-86 is a better engineering calc than the TI-89 due to its more intuitive menu interface for units conversions and what not.

The TI-89 is better suited for theoretical math work because of its ""pretty print"" and units system. Plus with the right software mods, you can do differentiation/integration with the variables intact - just a time saver really.

However I realize you're just trying to find info on the TI-83. My overall recommendation for the TI-83 is: don't bother. It's a solid calculator but pay a bit more and get at least a TI-86. It will serve you WELL into frosh or sophomore year of college (Calculus I-III). A TI-83 will have served its absolute purpose by the start of your senior year in high school.

It's like bringing a 9mm pistol in an African Safari. It will handle meerkats and other small creatures but once you get to the larger predators - it will not work very well. The TI-86 and TI-89 is comparable to a .50AE and .50 Magnum. It can tackle small stuff but will hold its own when the big beasts come around.",27,14.639313

I'm going to go against the grain here a bit and state that these pens are not good. They're barely passable and considering the price point at over a dollar a pen and priced higher than the much better Pilot G2 Gel Roller pens I use regularly I cannot recommend this pen.

Here's the problems:

 Cheapo Plastics. The out plastic shell is cheap, cheap, cheap. I regularly pull the actual pen apart by just removing the cap. This isn't just one defective pen either.

 No Padding. For longer note taking this is not a great pen. There's no type of grip or padding material to make the pen comfortable to hold for extended periods of time.

 Ink. The ink rolls on smoothly and consistently but smudges easily even minutes after it's been rolled on to regular notebook paper.

174,"It's portable and works well in that respect. It is also USB powered and works off your laptop battery, so you will not need batteries or to plug it in when you are traveling, which is a nice plus.

But two major drawbacks:

1. Won't scan to PDF. Of course you can scan, then open the image, then save to PDF if you have Acrobat, but it's a lot of extra steps and hassle when you are a busy professional.

2. Also, it scans a multi-page document as a bunch of separate images.

So, there are my comments. I carry this one with me when I travel, but try to avoid using it unless absolutely necessary for contract signing or something similar.

EDIT: So, I am modifying my review based on the fact that I figured how to scan to PDF. It's an option (not the default) and you can do it if you install the additional software CD that comes with the scanner. It will also scan a multi-page document, but you have to scan the first page, and then a little dialogue box comes up and you can choose to scan an additional page. So that is a PRO. However, that being said, for some reason, the PDF file sizes are HUGE, (for example, I scanned an 8 page contract, file size was so large that I couldn't attach the file to Yahoo email (it was well over 20 MB), it kept prompting me to use Dropbox), I solved the problem by reprinting the file to PDF and making it smaller using advanced options in Adobe. Obviously that is not an option if you don't have a full version of Adobe Acrobat on your computer.

So, yes, you can print to PDF, and yes, you can scan multi page, but there are issues. In my opinion, it's a toss-up-- it's still a great option for a bare-bones, USB-powered scanner that you can throw in a laptop bag and take with you. But for use in an office or something like that, it's just not convenient at all.",7,7.023317

The paper of the new ones seems a little softer, but isn't any thinner than the old ones. The company is using more recycled paper now, which may account for that. The metal tabs do appear to bend easier than the old ones, but as long as you don't overload your folders (and they're properly supported in the file cabinet), this shouldn't be a problem. Pendaflex still makes a quality product for a fair price.",5,6.7766037
176,"I sometimes telecommute from my engineering job, and when at home I often do CAD (computer aided drafting) for making, reviewing and updating engineering drawings. I also have a small micro-publishing business for sheet music. Both of these make the ability to print on wide format paper desirable. By wide format, I am referring to paper larger than normal 'Letter (8.5"" x 11"")', 'legal', or similarly sized European paper standards. The most common for me is 11"" x 17"", often called 'planograph' size.

Printers that can operate with these paper sizes tend to be professional models that are large, heavy, and very expensive ($2000 and above).

I used to own a used HP Laserjet 5100, which did the 11x17 paper, was fast, but did not have duplexing (double-sided) capabilities built-in (i.e. manual duplexing only). My biggest problem was space...it was so large and heavy that I had no space for it on a day-to-day basis, but it was so difficult to move to a storage area when not in use. Also, it got old and cranky after half a million prints, and toner got expensive. A lot of expense and bother for a printer that would be used occasionally.

After scoping around, I decided that my next wide format printer would be an inkjet type instead of a laser. Epson seemed to have the best machines of this type, at least in an affordable price range of less than $200 street price. A friend had an older Epson wide format in his factory and was quite happy with it. And I was a satisfied owner of an Epson Workforce 40 injet printer (see my Amazon review of that one too), so I thought highly of the Workforce series.

The WF-7010 is Epson's stand-alone wide format injet printer. It is intended for small offices, and is equipped with Ethernet 10/100 and high speed USB 2.0 connectivity. Since Epson apparently feels that WiFi is not commonly used in offices, where they prefer wired connections for security and other reasons, this printer does not have wireless connectivity. It is a large printer at about 22"" wide x 16"" deep x 10"" tall, but it is fairly light weight at about 25 pounds; it is light enough to be easily carried from place to place if desired, and would not overwhelm a light-duty shelf or small table. It does not shake a lot when in operation, so table sturdiness should not be an issue. Depending on the paper sized used, the printer's front-to-rear depth can grow to accommodate the extra paper lengths.

The WF-7010 comes with two paper trays; according to some older reviews, the trays cannot both accept the same sized paper, but on mine both trays are identical and can accept any allowed paper size. I have tray 2 (the lower tray) set up for 11x17 paper, and this makes the printer's total front-to-rear depth about 22.5"". Tray 1 (the top tray) is set up for 8.5 x 11 paper and in this configuration it fits flush into the printer and does not add to the overall depth. The paper exit tray pulls out of the front of the printer and telescopes to a maximum that makes the overall printer depth about 27""; if you are not using the largest paper sizes, you don't need to telescope the exit tray so far out. Each paper tray has a retracted mode and an extended mode. For sizes up to 'legal', the trays can remain in retracted mode. For larger size papers, you press a button inside the tray and this allows it to telescope into a larger tray. It clicks into a detent so that it is locked in the larger tray size until the button is pressed again to allow it to retract into the smaller tray size.

The trays are all-plastic, but are adequately strong and they can hold up to half of a ream of paper each (250 sheets), for a total paper capacity of 500 sheets. Each tray has internal sliding partitions to keep the paper centered in the correct position. Both trays have a removable gray-tinted plastic dust cover; these are not much use when the trays are in their retracted mode (where they fit fully inside the printer), but they are nice when the trays are in their extended mode where they partly extend outside the printer. Note that, unlike many laser printers with extended sized paper trays, the extended WF-7010 trays protrude from the front of the printer instead of the rear.

The WF-7010 has limited duplexing (automatic double-sided printing) capability. When printing to 'normal' sizes, and to regular paper as opposed to envelopes and such, it is fully auto-duplexing; it prints on one side, automatically pulls the paper back in and flips it, prints the other size and ejects it, then repeats for the next sheet. For larger papers, such as 11x17, I noticed an oddity. When I first got the printer, it allowed me to select duplex for even the larger papers, but it would print all the odd numbered pages normally, then instruct me to move the printed sheets from the exit tray to the paper tray and press a 'resume' button on the computer screen, and then it would proceed to print the second side of each sheet...this is not an uncommon way of providing a semi-automatic duplex capability. But the printer driver prompted me to upgrade the printer firmware, and after I did that the option for selecting duplex on larger paper sizes is now grayed out and I cannot select it; it still works fully automatically on normal paper sizes.

Epson says that the speed of the WF-7010 is fastest in its class, and they list 15 PPM (pages per minute) for black and white and 8 PPM for color. I ran a 4 page text document, on 8.5"" x 11"" (i.e. 'letter' sized) paper, and clocked the printer at 15 seconds for single sided and 27 seconds for duplex. This equates to 16 PPM for single sided and almost 9 PPM for duplex. Printing color does seem to take about twice as long as printing in black-only, but I did not clock its speed.

Epson says that the minimum paper size for the WF-7010 is 3.5"" x 5"", and the maximum 'user defined' size is a whopping 13"" x 44"" (normal largest size is 13"" x 19"", or 2 inches larger in each dimension than 11 x 17 paper). This bit about 44"" has me a bit boggled. The user manual that gets installed on your computer along with the printer driver does not mention such a large paper size, and says simply that the maximum is 13"" x 19"". But the printer is capable of doing multi-sheet posters, where it automatically tiles larger images onto multiple sheets of paper, in any of these user-selectable layouts: 2x1, 2x2, 3x3, 4x4. And when you are selecting the desired paper size in the driver, it does allow selections of up to 13"" x 44"", but it does not explain how to feed such a large size as 44"". As a test, I randomly selected a photo and printed to to the WF-7010; in the driver I selected 'multi-sheet' and selected the 4x4 option, and also selected 11x17 paper from the tray. The printer produced 16 sheets, and when I laid them out on the floor I saw that it had indeed tiled the photo to a total size, with all 16 pages included, of 31"" x 40"". I had not set the printer driver to print all the way to the edges of the paper (which it will indeed do), but it is obvious that the WF-7010 can be used to produce very large multi-sheet tiled posters and such. To resolve the 44"" question, I called Epson technical support; I was able to reach them without delay on a Saturday (this is better them most companies offer). The default tech support person did not know the 44"" paper question's answer, so the problem was referred to a 'level 2' tech, who also did not know and had to put me on hold for several minutes. He came back and stated that the WF-7010 does indeed allow printing on roll paper up to 13"" wide and 44"" maximum length (e.g. for printing banners), but it is a very manual operation; the lower paper tray (tray 2) is removed from the printer, and the long paper is inserted into a slot in the rear of the printer's internals and hand fed until the printer grabs it. I don't have any long paper handy, so I have not verified this feature.

Some other points:
- The printer driver auto-selects the correct tray for the paper, as long as you take the time to tall the driver which sizes of paper are inserted into each of the two trays; this is done through the Windows or MAC printer configuration and instructions are included in the user guide. Otherwise, you will have to manually tell the driver every time you want to print using different trays.
- The printer does NOT come with any data cables; you must buy your USB or Ethernet cable separately.
- The printer does come with four ink cartridges in black, magenta, yellow, cyan; these are the T127 type. The printer accepts either the normal capacity T126 or the high capacity T127. I think it is nice that Epson chooses to supply the printer with the high capacity cartridges, which are specified to produce approximately 945 sheets from the black cartridge and 766 sheets from the color cartridges. The OfficeMax where I bought the printer told me that the cartridges provided with the printer are ""low capacity good for only a few copies"", but I see no evidence of this. Epson's website states that the printer comes with full T127 capacity cartridges, and my experience with my other Workforce printer suggests that the included cartridges are the same capacity as what would be purchased when it comes time to replace them.
- The printer has a basic control panel without a display. It has five pushbuttons and seven LED lights. The buttons are Power, Ethernet information/setup, paper feed, ink cartridge access, and delete print job. The LEDs are Power, Ethernet activity, paper misfeed/user action required, and ink low/ink out for each of the four cartridges.
- The printer works just fine with the cover open, so you can see what it is doing.
- The paper feed & duplexer assembly can be detached from the rear of the printer for cleaning and/or removing misfed paper. It detaches by pressing two recessed buttons - no tools are required.
- The Workforce series is fast partially because it prints such a wide swath on each pass of the print head. Instead of the narrow band of perhaps 1/4"" width that most injet printers lay down, the Workforce lays down about 1"" on each pass. This is due to the head design, which includes the wide nozzle; the ink cartridges do not have nozzles, as they are simply ink containers that feed the ink head. This means that when you replace an ink cartridge, you are not replacing the ink head itself. On some printers, this could mean problems due to possible nozzle clogging, but Epson has worked out the Workforce head and ink formulation so that this is not an issue. In my experience, and that of associates who also use Workforce printers, the printers have never been disabled due to chronic nozzle clogging. Indeed, I have only once, with my older Workforce 40, had to run a nozzle clearing operation after the printer sat unused for many months, and running to operation once did the trick.
- The printer will print on all the usual paper types, such a bond, coated paper glossy and matte photo papers, envelopes. Its print quality is typical of most other contemporary inket printers, but faster as previously mentioned.
- Build quality is good, and the printer feels quite solid.
- The printer is quiet, but not as quiet as a typical laser printer.",150,14.4517975

181,"UPDATE:  The pen, tightly capped, tends to dry out quickly.

After I posted a negative review, I was contacted by the seller and asked to give the product a 5-star review.  I refused because the product pen was not good.  The seller again replied and asked for a change, and told me I need to take the tip out of the pen and reinsert it.  Once I did that, and turned the tip upside down, I could get the thinner writing I wanted, so I raise my rating.  However, the set needs instructions because using the pen right out of the package, after priming it, yields unsatisfactory results.

Original review:
I think these labels are very cute, so when I was offered them for review, I was delighted at the opportunity.  I'd just canned some jalapenos that I hadn't labeled yet.

And the labels themselves are very cute, sturdy, reusable, and washable.  I love the labels.  But of course, you need to use them with the pen that is included, and that is where I ran into problems.

First it didn't work, and because there are no instructions, it took me a minutes to figure out that you need to shake it, and then push down to prime the ink.  Now the ink is flowing properly.  It is a felt-tip type design.

However, the tip is too thick, especially for someone with poor handwriting like mine.  Even using the narrowest part of the pen, the lettering was too thick, so I tried a couple more times with the same effect.  So I asked my husband, whose writing is better, to try a couple of labels.  His turned out even worse than mine, because by now, the pen point was already getting mushy.

As much as I was looking forward to using these labels for homemade gifts, traditional labels are going to look better.  I had such high hopes, and I'm disappointed.

To put it simply, this is an amazing pen! Piston filled means it holds a ton of ink and I can go quite awhile without having to refill it. The body is a brushed fiberglass that feels great when holding it. The nib stays wet for a decent amount of time when uncapped and the rhodium (I think) plated, 14 k gold nib is a wonder to write with!

Now for the two minor flaws I've found with it. First, my pen came with slightly misaligned tines. Anyone with a lupe or magnifying glass and a steady hand should be able to gently bend the tines back so they are aligned correctly. The second problem was that filler hole that draws up ink is entirely separate from the feed/nib. As a result, filling it for the first time or after a cleaning, you will have to wait a few minutes for the ink to work its way into the feed. Other than those two minor gripes, I love the Lamy 2000!",8,7.0794215

The other gripe is that the paper is bent as you close the lid. I do like that you load from the front (as opposed to the MP560 which loads from the back), but I don't like that the paper bends as you close the lid.

Not only is the paper stock thicker and more durable, but the ""hangers"" seem to be glued securely in place. One of the biggest annoyances of the Staples brand is that the ""hangers"" aren't actually attached to the file folder and slide back-and-forth, making it a chore to fit them back in the filing cabinet at times. Sometimes, the hangers would slide completely out of place and land on the floor.

However, this means I will have to also be sure to somehow let myself know what color the ink is in the altered pens. I can slide the color-coded silicone sleeve off of the faulty pen and install it on the other, but that will not look so cool, since the top of the pens are also color-coded and so won't end up matching unless I am ""lucky"" enough to get a working casing that matches the color of the insert.

I think its best feature (aside from the all-metal construction) is the retractable tip, which allows it to be clipped inside the pocket without worrying about the delicate lead holder at the end breaking off.
But just yesterday, I noticed that the metal tube covering the eraser was loose, and for no apparent reason; It wasn't broken or bent in any way. I had to put a bit of sticky wax on the inside of it and slide it back down over the eraser top in order for it to stay put. It was almost as though the tube's width suddenly expanded -- even though when I received the pencil, the fit was perfectly snug. I'm glad I noticed the looseness before losing the eraser cap altogether.
Another drawback is that the pencil seems to take a lot less lead in storage than some of the others I own (such as my Zebra M-models, which hold nearly a dozen extra leads). For this pencil, trying to fit more than 2-3 extra leads in the reservoir jams them up in the inner tube, so it doesn't seem like this would be a particularly great pencil for long travels.",5,7.864644

205,"Summary: The Visioneer Strobe 220 has great specs, moderate performance and is absolutely 5-10 years behind in user interface. The installation even feels older. That said, it scans OK and the software bundle includes the excellent Omnipage Professional 15 and the venerable Paperport 11.

Pros:

Nice bundle with scanner hardware, drivers, OCR software (Omnipage Pro 15) and organizer software (Paperport 11). These appear to be full versions and work in their function.
Good price for the bundle.
The scanner is fast enough that it isn't an issue for a few pages (seemed like <10 seconds for a full page at 300dpi).
The scanner is quiet and does not seem any more noisy than the other sheetfeed scanners I have (Fujitsu ScanSnap, Brother 8660DN). Very tolerable.
The size of the scanner is small and does not take up a lot of desk space, for the scanner itself.
There are two settings for the output side of the scanner so that it can accommodate both thin and thick paper.

Cons:
Installation process is from Hell, or perhaps 1995. Probably in between as it uses the net, poorly.
** Don't bother with the Nuance registration, which is a lot of the problem. Just register later or send in the form USPS if you must. The online process is a mess.
For some reason, they needed two disks for the install; perhaps they used CDs.
The scanner unit is small, but the cable is HUGE. It is supposed to be USB, but it is a special Y cable that has a connection to the power brick integrated into it and a proprietary connector on the scanner side. The cable is about the thickness of most VGA  cables.
The software has amazing issues such as making the default scan size 8.5"" x 14"" which is US Legal pad. It apparently cannot be set to default to US Letter. Stupid, just plain stupid.
Scan quality is just OK. Good enough to make the OCR work.

206,"I've been looking for this type of shelf EVERYWHERE. I can not believe the prices these things either. I mean come on who wants to spend $500.00 or more on a bookshelf for your toddlers room? This thing is stable, sturdy and most importantly REAL WOOD!! I agree with previous user - It is something a preschool/kindergarden class would use in there classroom. It will last years and years.

207,"I enjoy using fountain pens, but one of the things you find is that they don't work well if you aren't on a flat surface (such as when you are walking around and writing down things.)  Thought I would give these disposable fountain pens by Pilot a try.  These are pretty darn cool!  Ease of use just like with any disposable but with a little bit of flair in a fountain nib.  Not exactly the same experience and they won't replace the nice fountain pens that I have, but I also am not worrying about refilling, or even losing one of these.  Plus, if anyone ""borrows"" my pen I will easily be able to spot who it was!

I recommend these if you are looking for a disposable pen but want an upgraded option.",4,5.1364036
208,I'll start by saying that these pens just like all Sakura products are great.  I use my Gellyrolls for coloring and these don't work.  The gold or silver depending on which set you bought takes over the color and you end up with a glob of gold or silver with some red/blue/green showing in underneath.  Don't let that stop you though if you only intend to write with these. I've used them for journaling in the past and they look spectacular.  Just buyer beware as I know there are a lot of Gelly Roll lovers like me who use their pens for special coloring projects.,5,5.0914736

210,"Thought this quantity is too much for my needs, but after sorting my stuff, I was proved wrong. I still got a few envelopes left which I'm sure I will have no trouble putting them to use in no time. The only thing I don't like about this is that each envelope has this sticky label that is annoying to peel. Since it's a bulk buy and sold in a box, the box label is sufficient enough. Also the velcro closure is too short to keep the cover closed if you stack the envelope to it's full capacity. I suggest to put a longer velcro...make it 1.5 to 2 inches longer and it will be perfect. It has currently a velcro with 1.25in in length.",14,4.388968
211,"The product works reasonably well, but it is so viscus that it sometimes clumps.

212,"This printer was shipped to me with no outer brown box to conceal what I was getting; a label was stuck onto the box that it comes in and there were huge pictures of the product with ""HP Printer"" printed all over it. You could see it on my porch from the next county. Anyone who might have been put off about stealing an ambiguous plain brown box might not have had any problem at all with stealing a brand new high end color printer from my porch, and Fedex did not even bother to knock to let me know something had been left. This may be because I got this from the Vine program, but even having gotten this product gratis I am very perturbed with the lack of discretion of the shipping department.

This is not lightweight, it takes up more space than our multi-function 11x17 printer, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brother-MFC-5890CN/dp/B001GFA8T6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brother MFC-5890CN</a>, and it's not going to replace it because we need the larger prints for client review plans. However, the print quality is vastly superior-- it has been on every HP printer I've ever worked with or owned. Even line drawings on regular 8  x 11 sheets are super-crisp, and color photos and rendered 3D models look superb on even regular paper. This thing spits out text pages before I can turn around to reach for them, and no setting your egg timer and waiting for those crisp color images, either. I honestly did not expect the speed to match the print quality, but it surpassed anything I ever hoped for and beyond.

Setting up is easy, but there are six different cartridges you have to put in. Four are ink cartridges-- separate colors means less waste, and HP makes it impossible to put the cartridges in the wrong way, or to put cyan in the magenta slot, and so forth. The ink slot is on the front-- easy to get to, easy to replace. The other two are printer heads that slip directly downward through the top of the printer. I am guessing that at some point these printer heads will need to be replaced (never had to deal with these on a previous HP so I don't know) but what's nice about them is that they have retractable handles on them so that they lift in and out easily, from fitted slots that make it impossible to put the wrong printer head into the wrong slot.

Letting it set itself up after turning it on is a bit confusing since it was difficult to tell when it was done. It has to do this internal test stuff before you plug it into/connect it with your PC during the driver installation. I know everyone loves wireless, but the PC we'll be using this with the most does not have wireless capability, and it would be nice if HP would include a 4 or 5 foot USB cable for this purpose instead of making us having to search for an extra or run out and buy one after getting set up to a certain point. It's a little thing that could reduce a lot of initial customer frustration, even for those who have wireless capability and simply choose to use cables, or for those experiencing difficulties with wireless setup.

The LCD touch screen is easy to use without picking up a manual. The only way to improve this would have been to make it tilt forward for using the printer on a higher shelf. It takes just about any kind of media card you can think of if you're not printing from your computer, and gives all kinds of options to receive images, like email or sending directly to an image editing program on your PC. There is a junk fax blocker that comes with it, which is really nice, and an automatic email button. So I can scan and directly email it to someone if I had it directly connected to the network. Turning off the wireless is not complicated, but you do have to read the manual to know how... if you don't this will cause conflicts. Once it's off, it functions fine. Printing on two sides is effortless and automatic, and can I just mention the quality and speed again? No paper jams, so quiet... it even LOOKS good.

Mine is a small business, and if I didn't need 11x17 prints this printer would be at the top of my list as an investment for my needs for so many different things. It would be the only printer I own, and if it's the only printer you ever own, you'll be very happy with it.

09/29/2010 UPDATE: This printer broke after about 18 months of light use 3 to 4 days a week. A gear inside a box deep inside the unit gave out. We had a professional repairman examine it, and the part was cheap. However, it was doubtful that he could get the part, and even if he could, the labor to take it apart and put it back together would equal or even exceed the cost of a new printer. I think the scanner on it still works, but we need a printer to PRINT. We were not printing hundreds of pages a day 24/7 on this and it should have lasted MUCH longer than what it did. It pains me to have to reduce the rating on this item to one star, but the use we got out of it isn't worth it. Either pass on this one or proceed with caution. I am honestly stunned that a Hewlett Packard printer failed like this so quickly.",9,9.853046
213,"I bought this machine to do DIY gold foiling with laser toner reactive foil. It works very well, heats up fairly fast (just a few minutes). I haven't used it as an actual laminator so I can't comment on that. It is the most decently priced machine for the width (fits 12"" paper).
I used it to foil edge/scrollwork on my wedding invitations, so I used small strips of foil. A few times a few pieces of strip foil got stuck and rolled up around the rollers. Holding down the ""jammed"" button and pulling a piece of paper back and forth helped pull out a couple pieces, but two other times I waited for the machine to cool, then opened it up by unscrewing the four small screws from the underside. I don't recommend doing this, but it worked and I was able to get the small pieces off the rollers.",2,5.9351134

219,"I knew I wasn't getting the ""grip"" version, but I still thought that the body would be somewhat cushioned because it is called ""Alpha-GEL.""  Unfortunately, it doesn't feel that different from the standard chrome-trimmed retractable Jetstream bodies sold in the U.S., and for me, it is actually even more slippery.  I grip pens right where the grip section joins the ""nib,"" but not all the way down at the writing tip.  This pen's nib (is there a different name for it with ballpoints?  I mean the metal section that surrounds the tip) is extra slippery, so I keep dropping the pen and have to squeeze it extra hard, tiring my hand.  (Yes, I've tried to adjust my grip, but I've done it for years and get the neatest handwriting this way).

The refill is the same great Jetstream, but for me, the black plastic version with the rubber grip is the most comfortable:  https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00X8YUT9M/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=A7WR6ALF2OX1P  It's not too squishy so I  have good control, and also is less slippery and lightweight.",3,5.497069

Caveat: If you are planning to use this device overseas, be aware that only the main base has a removable AC adapter for switch out (to 110-240V converter adapter). The power source for all handheld bases on this model are soldered, which means they are NOT removable to change.

221,"The DVD that came with the product would not load the drivers. Same error several times with varied settings.

However, they were still very easy to install on a Win7 network.

1. Plug it into the network using a regular LAN cable.
2. DO NOT allow windows to autoinstall a driver or use the CD's driver. It will be very slow. Instead download the PCL 6 driver package from HP's website.
3. If one network computer is always on, then you did not need to install the PCL software on other computers, only on that one, and enable sharing of that printer. Other computers can then automatically print to it using the generic windows print driver. Otherwise, install the PCL software on each workgroup computer.

After 7 months of heavy use I am impressed by its speed and quality. It is clearly well made and packaged.

The LCD screen and menu is small but hi-res and well-organized.

Made in Japan! Having purchased 5 laser printers or all-in-ones in the past 3 years, __you get what you pay for.__ There are NO real printer deals, and buying used is a huge risk.

One thing about HP Laserjet quality: My old office had multiple 10-year-old HPs that survived daily use and used mainly off-brand ink replacements.

So far I have only had jamming issues when using a sheet of labels. Doing this also ruined the nearly new $40 off brand toner cartridge in the product. I suggest using another product for printing sheets of labels.

In retrospect, I should have purchased the duplex version of this product for an extra $200. But I am still very satisfied at the very fast and high quality printing.

I have a lot of inks that sheen, as that's one of my favorite features of an ink, and this one is one of the tops.

The spring action on the clip is stiff and strong, and the connector pins offset to provide extra strength and stability against the clasp easily coming loose (see picture.) It may be that, because of the spring strength, people are using extra force and twisting it when putting it on their belt. It's not indestructible - but I use my badge sometimes 30 - 40 times a day at the printer and when going to and from various buildings at work and the cheap retractable reels will only last a few weeks.

In addition, the new online monitoring services knows your status and your inkjet cartridge choices and further is that each software upgrade (two in 5 months) was followed immediately by software driver malfunctions including one that no longer allowed B/W printing, as well low ink warnings and color malfunctions even though the cartridges were little used.  I suspect you get the picture!

The alternative are non HP inks (with the monitoring chip removed) and this remanufactured option is exceptional.  The price is very reasonable and thus far I would say that the quality is equal or better to the brand name inks.

The software is effective but not something which will change the way you see the world.  I personally store all scanned items by subject on a server for this purpose so the scan storage software is not too interesting for us.

I very rarely post negative reviews, but I no choice this time. The package is supposed to have two drums and it did. I put the drum in this morning and print is very light gray. I put the old drum back to make sure it wasn't the toner and it printed fine. So I then put in the second drum to see and it printed darker (not as dark as OEM though) but there was a big gash where it wouldn't print about 4"" long about every 3"" inches along the sheet.
UPDATED:
After talking with Global Toner they sent a replacement, but they didn't send two, only one. I opened the package up this morning and, I'm sorry to say, it was even worse than the first two. You could see many scratches in the drum (see the photo). You can see this is sold as ""new"" because it still has the black paper between the drum and the roller that has yet to be removed, yet the vertical scratches show it has been well used. I put the drum in just to verify that my presumption was correct and rule out any doubt.
I put 2 30% gray box the length of the sheet on the outside with a 100% black in the center to see the output. Neither did the black come close to 100% but the 30% gray printed closer to 10-15%, but the bigger problem is there are just sections not printing. See the photo of the print.

If you're reading this you probably already know about this ink. It's a super rich and vibrant bright blue that's infamous for i's permanence and difficult to clean nature. But you might not know everything, so read on, my blue ink loving friend.

So most people know that this is difficult to clean. If you get it on your hands, or god forbid your white porcelain like sink, you're in trouble. It will not come out with regular soap, water, and scrubbing. You have to whip out the bleach. Luckily you don't necessarily need straight up clean a murder scene industrial bleach. The bleach infused cleaners, such as the diluted gels, work just as well.

Still, keep it out of your nice eye dropper pens, unless you don't care about left behind blueness. Most people, myself included, dedicate a pen just to this ink.

That is basically the best description of this ink: People will dedicate pens just to this ink. It's the fountain pen equivalent of a 1500's Central American religious sacrifice. Noodlers should have called this Aztec Blue. (Give me credit, guys, if you name a future ink like this. ;))

You've gotten here and you're thinking, hey, where's the stuff I didn't know? And you're saying, what's up with the Houdini reference? Well, thanks for getting this far, and I'll get to that right now. What a lot of people don't know, at least in my experience, and what the Houdini reference is to, is to the fact that this ink does a disappearing act. Seriously, look it up, even on Noodler's site. If you leave this ink out to where it gets UV light it'll be illegible in 4-6 weeks and pretty much completely gone in 4 months. There's also word of it disappearing in closed books, but that's not conclusive as there aren't before and after photos like there are of it in window sills. At least I haven't seen any before and after photos of it disappearing in closed notebooks.

A lot of inks don't have UV resistance, but the reason this is especially worth mentioning is because this ink is notorious for its permanence and its ability to withstand cleaning. People then assume it'll be around forever on paper, because it's so hard to clean off of their sink or out of their pen. That can lead to a big surprise in half a year when they're looking for that Baystate Blue written thing they left out.

In conclusion, use it in a dedicated pen and don't write something you want to be permanent, or even something you want to read in half a year. Oh, and use it with sunglasses, cause it sure is bright!",2,11.569992

I use it for lectures, outlines, homework, recitation hw, and a weekly planner. National Brand is much better than AMPAD or TOPS. For those who buy it for personal use, the prices are pretty similar, I don't mind spending a few extra dollars for quality. Ampad and TOPS seemed a bit porous, my pens would sometimes bleed through the paper, especially a sharpie. The thickness of the paper for the different brands are similar, Ampad is a little more  translucent then National Brand. The lines on national brand are about the same darkness but little more narrow. I use sharpie fine point for all of my writing and this paper makes my notes crisp, attractive, and organized. I included some photos to show the note taking paper/ vs some of my line work in Orgo II.

I give this product 5 stars because its the best brand to buy, it has had its imperfections tho. The first time I bought it, the whole pad had a creese on the bottom left corner. It was annoying for the first 50 pages but less noticeable as I got farther into the pad. The past two times I had to re-up, the pads were about 3 days old when the backing came off.

Original Review

I have used a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HP-OfficeJet-7410-All-in-One/dp/B0002YGJY0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HP OfficeJet 7410 All-in-One</a>&nbsp;for at least seven years now and recently decided it was time to upgrade.  I went with this Brother model solely on the Consumer Reports ratings.  This wasn't one of their higher-rated inkjet models, but they indicated it stood out in terms of ink conservation and pointed out how some printers eat up a lot of ink performing maintenance tasks.  Since the cost of ink supplies quickly surpasses the cost of any printer, and since I am not as concerned about photo quality and seldom use a printer for that purpose, I decide to go with this Brother model.

I've had it for about two weeks now.  It isn't as tall as the HP I replaced, but it is quite a bit deeper and I would describe the shape of the printer as more similar in stance to a laser printer than most inkjet printers I've encountered.  This may be something to consider depending on the amount of space you have available in your setting.

Some reviewers have reported problems getting this printer set up on their home Wi-Fi networks.  No problems here in that regard.  The printer connected to the home Wi-Fi automatically during the CD-Rom installation process.  I can print or scan through any of the connected devices on the home Wi-Fi and it has remained connected with no issues since first having been installed.  For what it's worth, I use a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NETGEAR-WPN824-RangeMax-Wireless-Router-Wireless-router-4-port-switch-802-11-Super-G-802-11b-g-desktop/dp/B000W4HJ6M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NETGEAR WPN824 RangeMax Wireless Router - Wireless router - 4-port switch - 802.11 Super G, 802.11b/g - desktop</a>&nbsp;running WPA2-PSK.

Set up was pretty straightforward, albeit time consuming to install the entire Brother software suite through the provided CD-Rom.  One nice feature of the printer is a hidden tray that slides out for storage of this installation CD.

This printer makes a nice tone to tell you it is finished printing and it seems like a lot of appliances these days are including tones.  My mom's Samsung dryer all but plays an entire song when the load is finished.  This tone is not unpleasant and could most likely be disabled under preference settings - I don't know that for sure, but again, it's not unpleasant.

The printer does not seem to print color documents as fast as the HP it replaced.  I don't understand this bacause the printer it replaced was rated for 30 ppm black and white and only 20 ppm color.  This Brother model is rated for 33 ppm black and white and 30 ppm color.  However, this Brother prints much more quietly.  The speed of printing is not really a concern for me, but where I am not impressed so far with the print quality is in terms of the performance I've noted when printing from web applications.  Here are a couple of instances:

1.  I printed a page from Home Depot's web site - an order confirmation.  The gray text was so light I had to look closely to make sure it printed at all.  Other images, like the Home Depot logo, printed correctly.  The same page printed on my old HP (I still have it connected) without these issues.  I was printing from the ""printer friendly"" page version.
2.  I printed a shipping label off of the USPS web site.  I could not get the image to cover the entire page and this wasn't because I needed to go into the printer's advance settings and click the box that tells it to scale to the page size.  The same page printed fine on my HP.

I contacted Brother technical support to see if they could walk me through settings to make needed corrections although I was unhappy that it came to this as it is usually a pretty straight-forward process.  I've never required technical support for such a task when using other printer brands.

Tech support confirmed my settings were correct and they ultimately blamed the web application.  I get that.  Browsers behave differently, web sites behave differently, etc.  But if this were the case, why would the same pages print correctly on my older HP?  Brother tech support couldn't tell me and I never could figure it out myself.  Test pages print correctly as do documents printed from Word.  It's a mystery, but it does cause some concern as to what I might experience in the future.

I like that my Brother smartphone app allows me to scan and print directly from my phone.  I'm on the Windows 8 phone platform and most companies seem to only support Apple and Android devices.

I don't think that Brother's web site is as easy to navigate as HP's.  It looks more dated in design and finding information wasn't as straight-forward for me as it has been when searching the HP site.  This may not be the same take others would have but it's mine.  It was pretty easy to ultimately get to a chat window for support and I appreciate that Brother has a chat feature available as this is my preferred method of communication - faster than an email and less involved than a phone call.

At this writing I am just giving this printer three stars.  It's okay.  I don't like or dislike it at this point.  It's just okay.  If I hadn't encountered the two print issues described above I would probably be a big fan at this point.  I hope what I've encountered so far are just isolated incidents and that they won't be often repeated.  I know there are work around options such as saving the document I want to print as a PDF and then printing from Adobe Reader.  That worked in the two cases I mentioned above, but it's a more time-consuming process and too much effort for something I feel should be a simple task.  I guess only time will tell and I'll try to remember to update this review after I've had this printer in service for six months or so.

255,"Canon PIXMA MG6320 Black (or White) Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner and Copier

[11/01/2015 UPDATE: I put out a review for the new MG7720, the most updated version of the MG6320]

[12/11/2014 UPDATE: I suggest looking at the Canon PIXMA MG7520 or Canon PIXMA MG7120 if you are interested in the MG6320]

[12/13/2013 UPDATE: I suggest if you are interested in the MG6320 that you now also see the MG7120 reviews]

OVERVIEW:
----------

This is a sweet spot for the Canon PIXMA line with a lot of bang for the buck.  This is the new replacement for MG6220, only available since December 2012.

Note that the MG7120 is the replacement for the MG6320, NOT the MG6420.  The MG6420 doesn't have the gray ink tank of the MG6320/MG7120.  The MG6420 can't print to CDs/DVDs like the MG6320/MG7120/MG5420 can.  The MG6420 has 110% slower 4x6 photo printing, has significantly slower copying, and lower color print and scanning resolution than the MG6320/MG7120/MG5420 (Note that most folks won't notice/need the lower color print or scanning resolutions).

PROS:
------

- Like its predecessor MG6220, this has one more color than the MG5320/MG5420, GRAY, mostly for improved black and white results and to better darken colors.  I can't tell the difference gray makes with color pages, but some reviewers can.

- Like its predecessor MG6220, this has an ETHERNET connection (unlike MG5320/MG5420), allowing a solid, simple shared/network wired connection that stays up even when computers are down.

- Only model that comes in WHITE (in addition to the usual black).

- Like the new MG5420 (and unlike MG5320/MG6220), has a handy separate 4""x6"" and 5""x7"" photo paper drawer at the front.

- It is a bit shorter/squatter than its predecessor MG6220, which for some is a nicer form factor if on a desk, for example.

- The new ink tanks for the MG6320/MG5420 also come in an XL size now which reduces the page cost significantly.  The inks themselves in the new tanks are the same formula.

- The touch screen content-sensitive interface is getting rave reviews, however, I find the old interface just as easy, but the unanimity of positive reviews for it suggests it really is much better for many.

- For copying/scanning the top comes easily off (unlike the previous generation MG6220).

- The MG6320 (and the new MG5420) has 2x the number of black ink nozzles as their predecessors MG6220/MG5320.  This allows more efficient use of black ink and greater dot accuracy.

- With 10+ years of having a number of their products I have always found Canon to have great customer service, which for U.S. customers appears to be based out of Maryland and Virgina.

LESSER PROS:
-------------

- 5-15% faster printing than last generation depending on b&w vs. color, quality, etc.

- Can print directly from CF memory cards unlike the last generation, if that is important to you.

- Wider selection of devices that can print directly to it than the last generation.

CONS/WARNINGS:
-----------------

- This is very new (end of last year) and as such can be expected to have more issues than after some time passes.

- The inks are different than for the last very recent generation (for both this new MG6320 and new MG5420) and thus are at this time (early 2013), harder to find available at stores or online.

- For copying/scanning, the lid telescopes up for books only to the thickness of around a cellphone, whereas the previous generation MG6220 telescoped up to around twice that.  On the other hand the top COMES OFF easily now with the MG6320.

- The 50 second or so MG6320 cleaning/prepping routine has a short few second burst of mechanical grinding noise not heard in the MG6220 or MG5320 that starts around 20 seconds into the routine.  One can hear it across a mid-sized room.  This 50 second routine starts roughly 1m10s after start-up, for example.  Quiet Mode does not mitigate this.  If you are wondering, quiet mode quiets the actual printing a little at the cost of a little speed.

- No built-in fax, if this is important to you in an all-in-one.  Perhaps you want to get a dedicated one of your choosing near a phone line anyways, however if you are looking for a built-in fax the MX922/MX892 printers do.  This comes at a cost of not getting the higher end scanning of the MG models, though this may only matter to you if you are scanning negatives, MX922/MX892 scanning meets most other needs including most graphics needs, just as well.

SUGGESTIONS TO CONSIDER:
----------------------------

- See below consideration to select it not to automatically shut-off to reduce ink wastage.

- Consider choosing to print black & white or grey scale when color isn't necessary, this can lessen the amount of color layering to get black (though the use of grey and colors is not necessarily eliminated).  Canon feels the black is better with more color layering, you decide :).

- If you need something NOW that you will use a lot NOW, and the GRAY and ETHERNET is potentially useful you might consider weighing the pros and cons of getting the older MG6220 since it uses inks that are easy to find at stores and online.  The MG6220 is pretty cheap now, too, since it is being replaced, perhaps $95-$100.

- If the GRAY and ETHERNET (MG6320/MG6220) is for sure useless to you and you'd like a SMALLER FORM FACTOR, you might consider looking into the MG5320/MG5420, which are otherwise somewhat similar.

- Use Canon paper when you need optimal results with their ink, and test matte vs. glossy.  Matte is much less expensive and may meet most of your needs.  Let me know in comments if anyone finds a comparable quality and yet significantly less costly photo paper for this printer, I'd like to test it out.

- When doing black & white, for example text, choose HIGH QUALITY setting (and perhaps set it as the default) in the printer page set-up, it really makes a difference.

- In case of POWER OUTAGE, it is sometimes necessary to unplug it for A FEW MINUTES and then plug it back in. This allows capacitor discharge.

- The Canon site has lots of easy to find product comparison information for these inkjets, you might consider reviewing it before committing on a model.

- As soon as you can after getting your printer, print samples of full color, b&w, borderless photos, print on a DVD if that's important to you, etc.  Determine if you have a lemon before you get too busy with other things so you can exchange for a good one while it is easy to do.  These are complicated machines with lots of parts.

INK USAGE:
-----------

Anyone researching the Canon Photo Printers will likely be concerned about ink costs.  Here are 5 things you can do to mitigate this with the MG6320:

- Buy the XL versions of the ink, this is supposed to reduce the cost per color page to a very competitive 13-14 cents per page (vs. 16-19 cents).

- As noted above, choose to print black and white or grey scale when that will do just fine to avoid black made from layers of colors.

- Turn off the automatic shut-off.  Standby mode uses 0.9W, so on standby even all year uses around 8kWh/yr., so around $1/yr depending on where you live.  This can help lessen the number of 50 second cleaning routines as it runs around a minute after start-up and often at shutdown.  It runs the cleaning other times, too, which is good as it keeps things from clogging.

- Avoid printing pages with solid or heavily colored background in color when possible.

- Some fonts use 20-40% less ink than others.  According to a leading consumer magazine, Times uses much less than Arial which uses much less than Calibri, for example.

NOTE #1:  If there is no printing or cleaning routine at least once a month or so, select it to run a cleaning routine (easy to do) or turn it off and on to force it to once a month or so to keep the nozzles unclogged.  If they clog talk to Canon support for what is often an easy solution.

NOTE #2:  The MG6220, MG6320's predecessor, has a low ink early warning bug.  For example, when I take ink from a MG5320 and put it in a MG6220, the low ink warning bars show the ink as vastly lower.  This helps exaggerate the appearance of high ink usage.  Actual ink usage is high enough that this bug is pretty unwelcome.  If it wasn't for a leading consumer magazine's highest photo quality rating for all-in-ones and their estimated page cost that wasn't crazy, and lots of other favorable reviews, I think this bug could have been much worse for MG6220 sales.  This might make you feel better about MG6320's past lineage and/or buying a MG6220 due to concern over MG6320's newness and ink availability.

NOTE #3:  Gray is supposed to go much faster than the rest, thus you wouldn't want to measure average speed of ink usage based on gray.  I haven't tracked it in comparison to the other inks myself.

NOTE #4:  Just an informative, probably not very useful factoid :).  This model range of Canon inkjet doesn't do a big cleaning/purging after it prints, you are usually hearing head realignment.  However, it does quietly ""prime the head"" to keep the heat from ink clogging the print head and this uses a little ink (even for B&W).  This is much less ink than with the big cleaning/purging routine that is much rarer if you set the printer not to auto shut-off.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INK USAGE CANON DATASHEET:
------------------------------

As it is pretty difficult to find, here below is Canon's published Page Yield per Document numbers (I rounded a little) for MG6320.

I'm not sure how much of the difference between these numbers and users experience is due to the 50 second cleaning routine, difference between test and real world usage, etc.

Here at least you can see real world expected usage ratio between standard and XL cartridges and compare to costs to determine the better value.

260,"Nice attractive printer/scanner/copier.  Reasonably compact, handsome, if slightly fragile finish.  Clear LCD screen that can be positioned for several different viewing angles - convenient.  Bought it for my 88 year old mother's use and she caught on to it pretty quickly and found that she could make copies of organ music saving a trip to the library (this ignores the social component of the library and the savings maybe illusory).  Print quality and photos were good to excellent.  We didn't have any photo quality paper so it's harder to judge.  The key limitation to the printer is the use of a modular color cartridge, the yellow magenta and cyan ink is all in a single cartridge.  That means that when one color runs out the others can't be used so the arrangement doesn't allow for the complete consumption of each color as would be the case of a printer with individual primary color cartridges.  That said there is only one cartridge to buy and stock and only one to remove which for the intended user is probably a good idea.  The black cartridge is commendably large.  We've owned several Canon printers in the family and found them to be adequately durable for the home user.  It don't think this would be a good choice for a busy office but aside from the feeling of light duty it is sophisticated and capable.  It is front loading from a flat tray which is not removable which allows paper to be stored for a long time without curling and it is light weight allowing it to be moved easily to access the rear to clear paper jams.  It accepts a wide variety of paper sizes including ANSI B size which is a nice feature.  I would not be inclined to allow young children to use this without supervision.  The wireless feature was not used but would have been convenient. Pricing of printers is such that the designer is probably more interested in selling cartridges than the printer/scanner/copier itself and this one is commendably inexpensive - given the caveat of the single color cartridge. The scanner seemed to do a good job and was in focus.  Users should avoid a tendency to stack stuff on the flat scanner top. While this is a natural tendency, light loads tend to bow the scanner glass making the copies and scans out of focus.  Ultimately the scanner glass could be broken as it is comparatively thin. Print speed and copy/scan speeds are adequate.

Lot of bang for the buck in terms of appearance and capability.  An adult should get good use out of the printer. Better overall economy might be found with one of Canons other offerings.  A light user or one that prints mostly in black and white might find this printer very cost effective.  Regards,",2,13.582125

264,"Note: After using this unit a bit, I have downgraded my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars.  This is based on the price of the unit, the very clunky and extremely user-unfriendly software, and the fact that it scans most black and white photos very, very poorly.

When I unboxed the Epson WorkForce DS-30 scanner, I was immediately struck by the fact that it looks almost identical to my NeatReceipts mobile scanner.  The Epson DS-30 has a carbon fiber look to it while my 2-3 year old NeatReceipts scanner is white, but other than that, the size and appearance are virtually identical.  In fact, I've uploaded a photo of the two units positioned side-by-side so you can see for yourself (see customer photos on Amazon's main product page).

So they look similar and the prices are similar as of this writing, but are these scanners similar in performance and which one is better?

The answer is not nearly as simple as I thought it would be.  Both scanners are quite different in many ways and which one is ""better"" would depend on your needs.  As I mentioned, my NeatReceipts scanner is 2-3 years old, but the tech fellow told me that the specifications are ""similar"" to the current model.  I have upgraded the NeatReceipts software to the current version.

The Epson scanner is fast and efficient.  The output is very clean and professional-looking.  If you wanted to scan documents that would be used over and over again, this might be a good choice.  It's excellent if you need to scan a document fast and then e-mail it to someone.  You can quickly e-mail directly from Epson's software and it will access Outlook quickly.  I could scan and e-mail a document in less than a minute from beginning to end.  So it's very efficient in that regard.

Do bear in mind that NeatReceipts can sync with Outlook and add contacts and such.  While that's a nice and useful feature, I didn't see a simple way to e-mail directly from the NeatReceipts software.  If I missed that option, someone please let me know in the comments area and I'll update the review accordingly.

The Epson DS-30's scanned image is often superior to the NeatReceipts image.  It's somewhat close, but I don't think I'd use most of the NeatReceipts images if my intention was to use a scanned document over and over or post it to a website.  Sometimes, the NeatReceipts' images look wrinkled and/or tilted.  The Epson's images seem a lot cleaner.  The software can also automatically straighten the scanned image and you can also remove punch holes and such.

The Epson software is pretty flexible but somewhat poor in terms of user-friendliness.  You will create various ""jobs"" that tell it how to save or where to send the scanned image and in what format.  While their software works pretty well, I do think Epson could clean up the software to make it more intuitive.

I also like the fact that the Epson software allows you to scan directly to the cloud.  I set up a ""job"" so that the scanned image was sent directly to Google Docs and it worked perfectly.  The image looked great and the upload was very fast.  Again, the software isn't super-intuitive, but once you've figured things out it's relatively simple.

The NeatReceipts mobile scanner is quite different from the Epson DS-30 in many respects.  It will scan your documents in a similar fashion to the Epson, but it will also read and ""understand"" some of your receipts, business cards, and documents and then it will file and organize them by category.

So if you are scanning a receipt, NeatReceipts' software will fill out most of the information on your database automatically.  If you scan a business card, it will create a contact file showing the person's name, company, phone number, etc.  You can save this information to various sub-folders of your choosing and sync with other applications.  Generally, it stores all information and scanned documents and information in a ""cabinet"" which has the primary sub-folders of receipts, documents and contacts.  You can create sub-folders of your choosing as well.  You can also create expense accounts or other databases and export the information to TurboTax, Excel, Outlook and other applications.

As mentioned, NeatReceipts' image quality is sometimes inferior to that of the Epson WorkForce DS-30, but I have a feeling that's more about the software than the hardware.

So which portable document scanner is better?  I don't think there's a clear answer.  NeatReceipts can do things that the Epson scanner cannot.  It can read and ""understand"" the data on your receipts and documents and create reports from that data.  It doesn't always get it right by the way, so you need to review what is saved, but generally it does a pretty solid job.

But I think that NeatReceipts is not nearly the pure scanner that the Epson is.  If I owned a company and I was placing scanned images or documents on the web, I'd use the Epson DS-30 because the output is often nicer in appearance.

Also, the Epson can scan and upload to the cloud where NeatReceipts cannot.  The Epson is also a better choice if you want to quickly scan a document and e-mail it to someone.

Frankly, it wouldn't take a whole lot of tweaking to NeatReceipts and its software to make it the better choice.  If it did everything that the Epson did and also could ""understand"", sort and store data the way that it currently does, then NeatReceipts would be the clear winner.

But right now, which scanner is better really depends on your needs.  If you're looking for a flexible high-quality scanner that is very small and light but offers excellent image output and ease of uploading to the cloud and/or e-mailing then the Epson is your better choice.  Again, the software needs improvement in my view, but it works well once you figure it out.

The NeatReceipts portable document scanner is inferior as a pure scanner, but it has some pretty sophisticated abilities to understand, sort and store data.  If you are scanning receipts, documents and contacts and data sorting expense reports and the like are more important than image quality or uploading to the cloud and/or e-mailing, then this might be a better option for you.

Both are quality products and both have their strengths and weaknesses.  Both products could use some overhaul of their software though.  I will say that it wouldn't take much to make NeatReceipts a much better product.

I'd give the Epson scanner a 3 star rating and the Neat unit a 4 star rating, but remember that they are quite different in many ways despite the strikingly similar appearance.  In using the Epson DS-30, I came away more impressed than I thought I would be.  It is an excellent scanner in a very small, light and portable package.  I recommend the Epson DS-30.",55,14.627614

267,"Short Version:
Pros: Awesome, smooth writing. Love the flex.
Cons: Filling issues (easy fix and doesn't mean the pen is broken), Smells like I'm writing with a handful of vomit.

Longer Version:
I love the way this pen writes. Smooth and flexible... but not too flexible. I wouldn't mind even more flex honestly. For performance, this pen deserves 5 stars.

Unfortunately, it fell short in two areas: smell and ease of filling. The filling issue wasn't immediately obvious... just needed to re-seat the nib and secure it a little tighter so that there was a seal. It wasn't that big of a deal honestly. It also took me a little while to figure out that the pen would only fill with the little cap off of the plunger. All these things were, I'm sure, written in the instructions. But the instructions were printed on low ink which is kind of ironic since Noodlers makes some awesome ink. My other issue, which was the biggest issue for me, was the smell; the horrible, disgusting, vomitey smell. I read that it goes away... its been a week and it smells as strong as when I opened the bag. I don't even have to hold it close to my face.",2,5.853106
268,"Cross won't send out a pencil mechanism to replace the faulty one on my Tech 3, but insist that I send the pencil to them for repair or replacement. Further, customer service informed me that I should send the pen by UPS or FedEx because ""...we service those first because the people paid to get it to us.""

So take Cross's ""lifetime guarantee"" with a grain of salt. Yes, they'll service your pen or pencil and return it to you with a turnaround time of ""four to six weeks,"" and you will need to pay UPS or FedEx to speed up that service (no guarantees) and you will be without your pen or pencil for a month or more.

In fact it seems like Cross wants to have their cake and eat it too when it comes to assuring the purchaser of their lifetime guarantee. They seem to be saying, ""You can buy with confidence because our writing instruments are guaranteed for life,"" while at the same time making the option of actually getting a repair as unattractive as legally possible, just short of saying, ""We were just kidding about that guarantee."" Legally within acceptable parameters, but ethically right (write) on the edge.

273,"This is a somewhat disappointing paper from HP. When you open the box, you will notice first that the color is really not a good paper color and also that the color is not uniform, nor is the tone even across the face of the paper, which gives the appearance of a subtle blotchiness. There is a hint of grey in in the color, which makes it look a bit like newsprint. It's a real misnomer to call this ""Ulta white""--""kinda greyish"" is more accurate.
The second thing you will notice is that the paper is thin; now, this is 20lb paper, not 24, but it looks and feels thin.
Lastly, this paper suffers from significant bleedthrough, which means that you cannot use it for double sided printing or copying.

274,"I gave this pen four stars simply because the cap won't post. But if you don't mind holding or setting down the cap while writing, this is a very nice pen. It's quite slender, but not so much that I find it a problem to hold. The pen is finished beautifully, with gold colored trim that is very well done, including what I find to be a very attractive hooded nib--much classier than the Parker 51 style hooded nib of another Hero pen I own. The pen writes smoothly with a line that I would rate between fine and medium. The included ink cartridge converter uses a slide piston rather than the more common screw style, and it works very well. The cap snaps over the nib with a loud click, but it is no struggle to remove it. I would definitely buy this pen again.

Update: I have found a way to make the cap post. Just slipped onto the back of the barrel of the pen, even with a fair amount of pressure, it won't hold. However, if very firmly pressed on, while at the same time given a little twist, it will. I suspect that this could cause wear to the finish of the barrel, but in a pinch it works.",9,7.078883

280,"I love this pen!!
I am new to fountain pens and this is my 3rd one I own.
I saw it on a FB Bullet Journal group and was intrigued.
I had a hard time choosing a color (I will probably get another one  with a different color they are so affordable and nice)

First, the weight.  This has a nice feel to it. It has a metal body and feels good in your hand.  It feels substantial.

It comes with a refillable cartridge that is easy to use.  Just dip the pen in the ink and suck it into the catridge. So far , no leaking!.

I bought the Diamene ink. (Color Red Dragon) and while it seems it is a good ink it bleeds.. :>(

But the pen is INCREDIBLE in how it writes. I have the very fine nib and it is smoooth and the ink flows easily.  It makes it a pleasure to write.

I think it will be difficult, however to get a calligraphy effect, this is a very standard nib.

The other thing I really appreciate about this pen is the cost.  It is very affordable for a fountain pen.  It is cheaper than the plastic barreled Noodler Ahab.

If you are just getting into fountain pens this is  a very affordable introduction.

I needed something aggressive to realize my Halloween display for this year (a ""Dead Thing Driveway"", featuring a skeleton animal control on one side chasing Dead Things and a skeleton Pied Piper on the other side attracting them).

Considering all the loose parts, I had to either go with tying them on with monofilament (fishing) line or some form of double-backed tape. (You knew I'd get to the point in this review eventually).

This stuff is impressive. It grips like iron and SEEMS to stick effectively to all surfaces. In the following picture, I've used it on the animal control hat and on the Pied Piper shoes. So far, so good, but they'll be heading outdoors soon. If the tape sustains through Halloween, I'll bop back on here and raise this review to a full 5'er.

283,"Most of what I print, I could use a black-and-write laser printer.  Those are very fast, very quiet, and cost about 2c a page.

This printer is pretty fast for a color inkjet and does a pretty good job of rendering color if you use better-quality paper that doesn't swell up when you lay a lot of different color inks down.  For someone who doesn't print much, the ink tanks don't clog up before the ink is half used.  It's also pretty quiet.

I've had a color laser printer before, but it took seventeen guys and a 4-wheel-drive pickup with a winch to carry it upstairs, required more room than my wife's shoes, I had to buy a Kennedy roll-about tool box to set it on, it was noisier than that pickup I mentioned, and it shook so much that the local university called me when I used it, to make sure they weren't picking up an earthquake on their seismograph.  And toner refills cost about $300.  Ouch!  When I moved, I left it behing, and thart was a shame; I would like to have that Kennedy tool box.

To install on Win 10, do NOT use the install disk; instead, download the drivers, etc., from the Canon website.

Canon scanners are great.  And the software to run this as a scanner, a copier, and a printer, is good enough that my neighbor, a devout Luddite, can do all of those without reading the manual.  I recommend using Irfanview, a freeware graphics utility, for scanning, because it's great for handling the images after you scan, but it's not necessary.

I bought this to replace my 2420, because it's only a tad more expensive than the ink cart, and I thought it mighht have some sort of enhancement.  I haven't found any enhancements yet, but the 2420 made my neighbor happy; and I was having trouble with fixing her Brother printer that didn't handle cheap paper very well.

It's a big world out there, and there are surely other printers that will suit you even better, but I dpn't know what they would be.

Also, being wireless you can place this in a central location in your house and everyone can use it without having to come into your work area and distract you.

I have a separate photo scanner and it does a far superior job scanning photos.  I suspect that is probably true for all manufacturers.

286,"Scanners and I go way back. I've always considered scanners to be one of the little necessary evils some of us deal with while others simply refuse to. Those that choose to learn to use a scanner end up scanning documents for those lazy people we all know. All the more reason I want a scanner that is truly simple.

The SnapScan S300M is truly for the Mac user. So I'm going to write a short review from that perspective. Scanning on the Mac is becoming something of a black art. You truly should do a little leg work before you buy a scanner for the Mac.

Some people are looking to scan from within Adobe Acrobat or from Photoshop using TWAIN to acquire. I use both of those applications on a regular basis, but that's not what this scanner is for, and I didn't buy it for use with either of those applications. So if you're looking for a review from that perspective, skip over this as I'm only reading documents I scan in Acrobat and am not using the SnapScan from within Adobe's applications. I didn't see it show up as a TWAIN device to choose from. No, instead, I'm using this particular scanner in an effort to be more digital and less paper focused. To that end, I'm using the provided Fujitsu scanner software only. So if you are like me and you want to do any of the following:

Scan in receipts
Scan in documents (often more than one and sometimes two-sided)
Fax documents using an internet fax server, such as eFax
Scan without having to fuss at all with the scanner
Use your scanner with OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard)

If those are your reasons for looking at this scanner then let me tell you, you've found the scanner that actually works. You may have seen others write reviews that state the scanner ""was"" great until the user upgraded from OSX 10.5 (Leopard) to 10.6 (Snow Leopard). Well, Fujitsu has updated the scanner software to make this scanner work perfectly with 10.6.

What you should do when you get this scanner is use the disc that comes in the box to install the software initially. Once done download the update:

[...]

That link is a download page and in it you shall see a file and description called, ScanSnap_V22L12_S510M_S500M_S300M.dmg.  Download that and install it to update the software for use in 10.6 specifically. If you're not using 10.6, Snow Leopard, do not install this update. It is only to give the software in the box compatibility with Snow Leopard. You'll see the page describes this so just confirm. At the time I write this, this is the correct information as of December 23rd, 2009.

Frustration free scanning:

This scanner has but a single button it. Stick the document in the tray, hit the button, and the software you installed opens automatically and scans both sides of the document simultaneously.

In the settings you can set a pre determined folder where your scans will go. In addition, you can choose from three different styles of default save file name standards. I chose custom file name with a three digit counter. So by default my first document is ""untitled001.pdf"" and the next will be ""untitled002.pdf"" and so on.

Now, once you load a document, business card, or those horrible receipts that use a heat cylinder to effect printed text, you'll be able to choose one of the four options:

Scan to Folder
Scan to Email
Scan to Print
iPhoto

In the case of email and print, that default file name and folder location get a named file stored as a copy of the event. This makes scanning a business card and emailing it to colleagues... well... a snap.

I'm a subscriber of eFax. So when folks fax me, it is turned into a PDF and sent to me via email. And every now and again I have to sign said document and fax it back. This would be a difficult thing to do considering I only have a cell phone and broadband internet. A fax machine is not an option for me, nor do I want one. I'd rather faxes reach me wherever I happened to be getting my email. The trick is how to fax back.

With a snap scanner, I just print, sign, and scan. I can then fax or email the resulting PDF back. It's simple, fast, and I have a copy in my Mac of the signed document. And that's truly the goal for me. I want digital copies not paper copies. I want what would be in a file cabinet to instead be in my Mac as files in folders.

Need to scan a photo? No problem, those go into iPhoto. If you want to make a copy of something, just choose ""Scan to print"". You get a PDF in your default folder, plus a print copy of the document. And because you have a document feeder, you can make multi-page printed copies if you like.

If you have a 10 pages of documents that are printed on one side, be sure to turn off duplex scan. Here is an easy way to deal with the scanner via the Mac app that resides in the dock to handle such subtle changes.

Load the document in the tray, but do not hit the button on the scanner.
Go to the dock icon and right-mouse click on it.
Select Simplex Scan.

The side with the text facing the scanner, not you is then scanned. Doing this will act like pressing the button on the scanner and will start the sheet feeder automatically. Likewise, you can do this with Duplex scanning. Same method; right-mouse click on the dock icon and choose Duplex Scan. Either way it makes it easy to just use the scanner without adjusting settings all the time.

Fujitsu really thought through the process of fast and efficient scanning. This is perhaps the best scanner experience I've had to date. I don't know why others make such tasks overly complicated.

I saved the best for last. You can take a full 8.5"" x 11"" sheet and something small, such as a business card and through them both on the tray and hit scan. They are each scanned, one item a time automatically even though the sizes are totally different. The resulting PDF knows that these are two different sizes automatically. Try that in a flatbed scanner.

So if you're looking for easy document scanning, this is it. Flatbeds have their place. But even the flatbed I have at my office which has an ADF is no where near this simple to use. And I wouldn't dare though a business card in that. It's just not setup to do such a thing. SnapScan is.",9,12.17548
287,"It works just fine.  Voice quality is OK, and the machine is relatively easy to use.  The best part is that it has an audible alert that there are messages waiting; this is important to me since the machine is in the office.  The audible alert is also the worst thing...it is really not very loud at all; easy to miss.

The visual alert of message waiting is also pretty good; it flashes when there is a new message and is on steady if there are old messages that you have heard.  (It's off when there are no messages stored).

Interestingly, it uses flash memory for everything so no battery backup is needed.  Of course that means the clock goes on a power failure.  I think the clock freezes at the time of the failure but I'm not sure about that.  There is a warning on the display that tells you the clock needs to be reset.

Caller ID is supposed to reset the clock but the instructions are a bit ambiguous.  They imply that it keeps the clock synchronized once you set it, but says nothing about resetting after a power failure.  I have not done that experiment yet...

Bear in mind, this is a steel nib and chinese build quality can occasionally be spotty. I had to open the shoulders of the nib and then bend the point to get it to flow, now it's almost too wet, but writes well (wet, no stop-start, mild-moderate feathering) with the typical lack of feedback a steel nib offers.

If you do enjoy the pen but want it to write better, it uses a #5 nib, easily replaceable with a Knox #5 nib (just grab the nib by the point with a paper towel and pull and it slides right out. Same for the feed. It can be tight the first time, but just pull, nothing will break) that will really open the pen up to write like it should. I honestly don't love medium nibs, so I'd suggest a fine for most people, extra fine for me, but knox makes exceptional steel nibs that have been writing well in my pens for a long time. If you're writing notes in class on notebooks, I suggest extra fine.

Overall, the pen itself does feel very well built, far better than I was honestly expecting. all the gold plated parts are proper metal, the feed and point holder (silver part) is also solid metal, the plastic is smooth and the fit and finish is great. The plastic itself apparently varies wildly in color, as mine came with very few white inclusions that for some reason just sit in the middle and are all grouped up, which makes it look like it's scratched, not black/white.

If you are already accustomed to fountain pens, I'd say go for a jinhao 250 and spend $8 on a knox nib if yours doesn't write well. If this will be your first pen, get the pilot I mentioned above. THAT pen is just ridiculously good writing out of the box and writes most similarly to a very fine rollerball, which I've found people unaccustomed to fountain pens really seem to like.",8,14.503169
293,"I have owned Montblanc, Pelikan, Waterman and Cross fountain pens over the years.  Recently, I was given one of the Lamy pens, and my interest was again piqued.  While functional, I found the Lamy too ""modern"" looking for my taste.  I decided, for fun, to order one of the inexpensive ones here on Amazon that are made in China.  This was one I felt I couldn't go wrong on.  It was very inexpensive, and if it turned out to be junk, I didn't have much to lose.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The pen arrived timely, and appears to be of reasonably high quality manufacture.  The barrels is all metal and the ""golden horse"" pattern, while quirky, is a conversation piece.  The metal appears to me to brass and the threaded parts are precision machined, with nice polish and no rough areas.  The cap is a nice, polished and quality-feeling plastic materal.  It came with the screw-piston adaptor, but I prefer using cartridges (though not environmentally ""friendly"" and I don't like that so much, they are simply less messy and are very convenient to carry and install).  I have been able to use international cartridges and some Lamy cartridges I have.

What you would expect to be a ""fail"" on these instruments is the nib and its assembly.  This pen came advertised with a ""medium"" nib.  It has a very smooth writing feel and seems to lay the ink down consistently.  With more porous papers, there is some noticable wicking and bleeding (this would be expected, but it is more noticeable with this pen than a couple others), but on nice paper it has a nice, bold look.

I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars, in comparison to a couple other pens I recently acquired that I think are slighly better.  This purchase inspired me to purchase a couple of the other Chinese manufactured offerings here on Amazon that I gave a 5-star rating.  This particular pen seems to me to be every bit the equivalent of the Cross pens I have owned - the others, compare very favorably to Montblanc and Waterman, in my view.

My 4 star means not the very best, but very darn good!  For the cost of these pens against the cost of the ""name brands"" it's simply a no-brainer in my view.",6,14.606124

298,"I purchased this printer because of the good reviews it had in Amazon and because I own an old brother laser printer that has worked flawlessly for years. I was looking for a wireless printer and so this seemed like an obvious choice. Unfortunately in the year that I have had it I have been able to print wirelessly from my computers fewer than a handful of times. Invariably I get error messages, it prints out a piece of paper that tells me to consult my manual. In this day and age I expect my computer hardware to be plug and play. I'm entirely unwilling to spend valuable time trying to figure out why a printer does not print. I have on the Epson printers, Canon printers, and as previously noted an almost antique Brother printer and none of these have ever given me the slightest problem. In summary, this machine is a piece of junk. It does function as a fax machine consequently I cannot put it in the ""doorstop"" category, but it comes pretty damn close. By the way, in case anyone thinks this might be an operating system error, I have attempted to use this printer with my Mac, my daughter's Windows Vista machine, and my new Windows 8 computer.

The colors are identical with the OEM HP colors. The finished/dried color results are identical to the original HP inks. The re-manufactured cartridges are an exact fit for my printer.

I would like to point out one thing... re-manufactured inkjet cartridges are one thing, but PRINT-HEAD CARTRIDGES are a different thing all together. I do not recommend using any brand of re-manufactured PRINT-HEAD cartridges - use only new HP OEM PRINT-HEAD CARTRIDGES.

These are designed for people with long nails to be able to use comfortably. The bottom half of the pen is squishy, so your nails actually sink into the pen casing while you are writing. It's a very ergonomic and quite ingenious design. I assume that it was marketed as ""for her"" because men don't commonly have long nails like females do. Terrible marketing, great product, good design, and it writes smoothly. I'll actually end up getting more of these when I run out of pens.

302,"I bought this tropical themed wall calendar for my beach themed office and I love it! Since it's an academic calendar, it runs from July 2016 to June 2017, which is perfect for me since I work in financial aid at a community college and it maps out our aid year easily without having to have two regular calendars to span the aid year. I was surprised how large the calendar was when it arrived (15"" x 12"") and I love how large the date boxes are for each date with plenty of room to write appointments, deadlines, birthdays, etc. The calendar has a metal O ring that makes it very easy to hang; I used a push pin to hang this on my corkboard and it rested firmly on it without falling off.

I love the beach scenes on it, but I do wish you could see more of the actual scene because most of it is concealed by the white date boxes. You can see some of it through the boxes, but not much. Most of what you can see of the scene is around the borders of each page.

328,"I just got this machine to replace two others a month ago in my home office - an HP inkjet all-in-one 6310xi, and a Brother laser printer HL-1870n.

This new unit is superior in just about every way.

The print quality is much higher than on the HP. In B&W it is similar to the old brother laser.

The print speed is out of this world, especially for color. The inkjet could take minutes per page for letter-size photo prints. This one doesn't seem to take any longer than for other prints, amazingly ! This is no doubt thanks to its 128 MB of memory. I was thinking about upgrading the RAM, but there just isn't any need to do that at all !

Copies are also spectacular, just as fast as any photocopier. The HP all-in-one could take several minutes per page in the highest quality in color, and typically at least a minute even for high-quality black & white. And of course the quality is much better.

Scanning speed is also great. It is really measured in pages per minute, not minutes per page.

The ADF duplex scanning is invaluable.

The bundled software (Paperport) is also very reliable and far superior to the bloated crap that came with the HP.

Despite its size, this unit actually saves office space compared to having two separate inkjet color and black & white laser units.

Photo prints are very good. I have noticed some yellowing compared to the inkjet prints. But I am confident it's possible to adjust this in software and make the photo prints just as good as the inkjet. I just haven't had time to fiddle with it yet.

The unit is not perfect, but nearly so. There are a couple things that I wish were improved :

- The ADF is limited to A4/letter size. For legal size documents, you must use the glass scanner. This is my biggest regret about the machine. If I could I would give 4.99 stars because of it instead of 5. EDIT: it can scan legal through ADF, but only one-sided. It cannot do duplex scanning through the ADF. For that you must use the glass scanner.

- It weighs 85 lbs, actually 115 lbs with all the packaging. With the packaging, it was too large to fit through my stairs. I had to remove it all first. And if I didn't have a roommate, I would not have been able to bring it to the 2nd floor. I wish there was a printer with all these features at less than 50 lbs packaged. Or perhaps Brother could deliver it in 2 separate parts to assembler (let's say, printer unit and scanner unit) in 2 smaller boxes, so one person alone could move it and set it up.

- It doesn't work with glossy inkjet photo paper. That paper just melts and half the sheets come out pink. I had to sell all my Costco photo paper with the HP inkjet, and buy new special laser photo paper (HP branded) that worked great. I wish I had known about this requirement before the purchase.",116,14.652808
329,"I have been using the Visioneer scanners since the days when the scanner was incorporated into the keyboard.  I have over 100,000 scanned documents from Visioneer on my computer.  Suffice it to say, I am a document scanning expert.  So when the old Visioneer gave up the ghost, I started looking for a replacement.  The Scan Snap S300 got good reviews, and so it has been sitting on my desk for 575 scans - still a way to go to match the Visoneer series.  Here's what I have noticed in the short time of using this scanner.

Pro:
Fast, easy set up.  It was up and scanning in less than 5 minutes.  My XP operating system finds it every time.  There is no ""Off"" button, instead, it comes on and loads when you raise the lid to scan.

Output is in .pdf format - universally accepted protocol.

Scans in fastest and faster mode are fast and good.  Color photos scanned in best quality take some time.

I use Paperport 11 to manage the documents, but it will not scan directly into Paperport.  I have to manually enter each document in the folder I want.

Will scan both sides of a document in one pass (duplex).  Helpful if you scan a lot of documents that have writing on the front and back.  But honestly, how many business documents have writing on the front and back.  Most business letters are single sided, most credit card statements are single sided.  So this feature is used very rarely.

Cons:
The sheet feeder does not always load the paper in a straight path.  A lot of times, it will skew the paper and run it through at an angle.  However, the software can (and does a good job) of straightening out the scan on your screen.

Scans do not start automatically.  You place the paper in the guide, and press the scan button to start the process.  Does not sound like a hassle, but it's just an extra step in the process.  I wish it had the instant scan feature of the Visioneers.  Place the paper in the guide, and it should start automatically.

Scans in the fastest mode look okay on the monitor, but if you enlarge them, they begin to show their degraded quality.  Scan at a higher resolution if you need to enlarge your document.  I use Paperport to manage my documents, and I can ""enhance"" the scan with Paperport after it is in the folder.

OVERALL:
Yes, it's a good replacement, but has some shortcomings that stand out like a sore thumb to me.  The lack of twain driver, not allowing me to use it directly with Paperport is one issue.  Plus the fact that the scan does not start automatically.  Would I buy it again?????  Maybe, but I would buy another brand if I could scan directly into Paperport without having to manually drag the documents into their folders.",4,14.647253
330,"Wow.  This is a fabulous pen and well worth the coupla bucks it costs.  It is described as claret and gold.  The claret is a dark red and black.  It is very classy looking.  The snap on cap (as opposed to screw on) is pretty heavy.  It messes witht the blanace of the pen when capped, but without the cap, the pen is perfectly balanced. It writes smoothly, and finely (I am not fond of a medium nib and this one truly is fine).  It comes with a converter which by itself is usually more than this pen costs.

341,"LOVE these needlepoint refills!  I liked the original that came inside the pen, but these are even better.  Precise writing, no skipping, no lagging, no glob of ink on your first outline (let alone your clothes).  No complaints whatsoever.",2,2.958505
342,"We of course had to do a LOT of rearranging to get this size of a printer in our office, but it was accomplished.  Be aware this is a BIG printer -- but with two trays in front and a duplex part in back, that's to be expected.

I love being able to scan wirelessly!  The sheet feed has worked perfectly, the black toner is crisp as you'd expect, the colors are clear and vibrant! I had planned to buy another product from a competitor, but when I read the reviews, most people were saying they wished they'd bought this -- and too bad on them.  I bought this instead and am incredibly happy, not wishing I'd listened to the other reviewers who said they wish they'd bought this instead.

HIGHLY recommended.  We do have a lot of printing/scanning to do as we are helping an attorney with an appeal.  As anyone who knows what this entails, this was why we needed the scanner.  There are a lot of ""apps"" that supposedly come with it, but one I can say I've already used is shoebox.  Really, I can't find anything bad about this machine.  OH!  There were extra color cartridges included -- not just the cartridges that would come normally, but EXTRAs!  No extra black.  HP ink is also very expensive (I bought extra black and a full set of color for $119, which about killed me, but there's nothing worse than needing to print in color and you're out of ink!) but hopefully the cartridges will last as long as other HP cartridges do (I also have an HP laser, bought it used 3 years ago, and STILL haven't replaced the toner cartridge that came with it! although I do have a replacement should/when I need one).",2,7.1227636

I'm terribly sad that I chose Canon; I never had this issue with HP printers. Now, I want to stretch the printer's life as much as possible, but if it means I have to spend a fortune in getting the ink, I'm going to sell the printer.",5,6.7519884
346,"I slammed the earlier version of this device (the m505) for its horrible color screen, but adding active TFT and 16 MB standard makes this a near-perfect PDA. It's nice to know that Palm can learn from their mistakes.
This is functionally identical to the m130, which is cheaper, but you get what you pay for. The m515 has a significantly larger screen and far less bulk than the m130, easily justifying the higher price. With the built-in difficulty of pointing and clicking on a Palm device, size matters.
The life of the lithium-polymer rechargeable battery takes a hit with the new vibrant color screen, but you can still use your m515 fairly heavily for days before you need a recharge.
The only other compromise is the screen is low-res at 160 x 160 pixels. If you want photo-realism, you can buy a Sony Clie with 320 x 320, but those models have worse battery life and cost much more, so it's your choice.
The 515, quite simply, is the slimmest and lightest full-featured color PDA.

Here's a basic product guide:
Palm m100/Handspring Visor -- Bargain basement models with 2 MB of Ram. Good
 starter models for the price. Distinguishing characteristics: Visor has significantly larger
 screen/expansion slot and fast USB cradle. Palm has slower serial.
 Palm m105/Visor Deluxe/Visor Neo -- Workhorse models with 8 MB of Ram (plenty for
 monochrome models). Visor has bigger screen/USB/expansion slot. Neo has faster
 processor.
 Palm m125/Visor Platinum/Visor Pro -- Upper middle class models. Visor has larger
 screen. Both have USB/expansion slot.
 Palm Vx -- A discontinued classic, not significantly expandable. Smallest full-function PDA with lithium
 rechargeable battery. Sharp, full-size mono screen. Slow serial port.
 Visor Edge/Clie slimline -- ultraslim mono models sell at a premium, but have durability questions.
 Palm m130 -- Fills consumer color niche. Compare to color Clie models, Visor Prism.
 Small, bright screen, rechargeable battery, expandable.
 Palm m515 -- top of the line. Screen is now brighter, 16 mb included, now we want
 higher resolution. Still, a great improvement over the horrible washed-out color on the
 Palm m505. Compare with top Sony models/iPaq.

348,"Increasingly, theres no need to have piles of paper stacked around, so having a good scanner is important for creating digital versions of documents you wish to save. The Brother ADS2200 Document Scanner is advertised as a high-speed, color, duplex scanner with a space saving design.

The scanner comes with a document feeder that attaches to the back of the scanner, a power adapter, and an instruction manual/warranty. Importantly, which Ill discuss further below, this scanner does not support WiFi and does not come with the required USB 2.0 cable that is necessary to scan to your computer. The scanner also does not come with necessary software and drivers  you must have Internet connectivity to first download this software to your computer for installation  the literature says Windows and Mac platforms are supported.

In use, the document feeder is rated to hold about 50 pages, and there is a document output tray that unfolds. The footprint of the scanner folded up but without the document feeder is about 6 x 11.5, but Im not sure I would call this a space saving design since with the document feeder attached (where would you store it otherwise?) the scanner takes up about 9 x 11.5 of room. The feeder does not fold up. With the document feeder and document output tray fully extended, the scanner requires about 20 x 11.5 of desk space.

My main use case is to scan documents to a USB thumb drive, which this scanner supports. I turned on the scanner  there is a designated round power button on the front of the scanner you must press to turn the scanner on. Im noting this separate power button, because in other scanners, such as my wifes 8-year-old Fujitsu ScanSnap, simply unfolding the document output tray turns on the scanner. With this Brother scanner, power on/off is a separate step. To turn the scanner off you must press and hold the power button for about 3 seconds. Once powered on, I plugged in my USB thumb drive and pressed the scan to USB button, which initiated the scan and created the resulting document file in a Brother folder (the scanner created this folder automatically on the thumb drive).

Note that one issue with the scanner is that you must first turn on scanner, then connect the USB thumb drive  the order matters. In other words, the scanner does not load the thumb drive drivers if you plug in the thumb drive and then turn on the scanner  the necessary drivers to support scanning to the thumb drive are not then loaded. However, if you have the scanner correctly working with the thumb drive, then turn the scanner off and on while leaving the thumb drive attached, everything works OK.

I scanned both black and white papers and some color brochures. Both auto-scanned to PDF format (which I liked) and the color ones correctly saved in color. The scanner also scanned both sides of the paper automatically (duplex mode), including the colored pages. The scanner was able to scan the outside of envelopes, thick mailers, and regular sheets of paper. In use, the scanner scanned documents relatively quickly  the scanner is rated to scan color duplex at 18 pages per minute.

The document feeder is rated for 50 pages. My scanner auto-scanned a 32 page document to one PDF file. In other words, the scanner assumes that everything you put in the document feeder goes into the same PDF document, so essentially its one output file per scanner button press. This may be an issue if you are trying to scan a document with more than 50 pages, since you will need to then stitch together the multiple resulting PDF files.

While you can feed up to 50 pages into the scanner, the scanner has trouble outputting this many pages. The PDF file that was created was fine, but the sheets of the original document became an out of order mess, as the output tray was not able to handle multiple pages. The first 15 pages were output in the correct order, but after that the pages were inserted into the stack in random order.

Another big deficiency with the scanner is that since this version is not wireless, to connect the scanner to your computer you must use a USB 2.0 cable. Strangely, this scanner did not come with the cable! So just be sure you have one of these cables on hand if you want to connect the scanner to your computer. With more wired devices using USB-C and micro-USB connections these days, requiring that older USB cable format while not including it with the scanner is a shortcoming.

So in summary, this is a reasonable, basic scanner that supports scanning to a USB thumb drive and creating color, full duplex scans. And the file format defaulted to PDF, which I liked. However, not including the required USB cable to support scanning to a computer is a big deficiency. My recommendation would be to spend a few more dollars (right now the WiFi version is $10 more) and buy instead the version of this scanner that supports wireless scanning, model ADS2700W.

351,"I have had three different Magic Jacks for many years now. It's not the greatest quality, but for my limited calling, it seemed like a steal - especially compared to traditional land-lines.

There's a tiny lag, and once in a while some quality issues (I have a very fast connection, so that's not it), but as a performance to value proposition I would give it 3.5 stars.

I can no longer recommend it though. I bought an Ooma (that now follows a very similar pricing model) and I was trying to transfer my Magic Jack number to the Ooma to use as my primary line, and continue to use my Magic Jack as a secondary line. I was angry to find that Ooma charges $40 to port a number, but I was downright furious to find that MAGIC JACK CHARGES $30 TO RELEASE YOUR NUMBER. What??? So $70 total to port a number that they don't own in the first place? (doesn't the FCC technically own these numbers?)

So - this thing is a cheap telephony solution and overall worth it, just understand before you buy, that if you ever decide to go elsewhere, they're going to RIP YOU OFF to the tune of $30 more bucks. Therefore, in my mind, 2 stars is it.",11,6.9613934

After a couple months, it started printing diagonally, and any attempts made at realigning the jets did not succeed in fixing the problem.  The next issue was that printer wouldn't catch the paper in the feed unless there was a good stack behind it to push the paper forward into the feed.  A few weeks later, it started taking the paper in at only one corner, causing the printer to jam.  I called Epson.  They sent me a refurbished replacement. Guess what?  The paper jams in that one, too.  I now have two worthless Epson CX9400Fax printers in my possession.  Don't waste your money on this one.",3,6.853764
354,"This pencil was a recent edition after doing heavy research into lead types, different styles of graphite, lead thickness, and the virtues of having something other than ""#2 pencil."" As a caveat, I am left handed and have a terrible writing wrist. I have struggled with pencils all my life.

This is a mechanical lead holder, except the clutch mechanism is not a ""slip"" mechanism, meaning it progressively advances in measurable increments the lead, rather than a simple vise that uses spring tension to hold the lead.

The pencil itself is stunning and the fit and finish are extraordinary. It's all metal (likely aluminum) and the blue is a deep blue. The bare metals all polished. The clip is sturdy. The inside holder for the lead (which only fits one) is brass (some other reviews report plastic, but mine did not have it). The point cap screws on tightly.

The lead viewfinder (that indicates what type) is adjusted with the lead cap, which means it stays sturdy in its place until you're ready to change the lead type. This keeps the viewfinder from wandering. The overall fit and finish is excellent, and the weight feels heavier than a traditional pencil, but not so heavy as to annoy my left hand.

When advancing the lead, it feels very sturdy, and the clutch is tight, which means there's not a lot of ""give"" in how much of the lead advances. I also played with pushing the lead back in (to see if it would grind against the clutch mechanism) and it had absolutely no grind or scratch, indicating that the mechanism has enough give as to not rub off excess graphite (and potentially lubricate the mechanism and cause slip later on).

It comes with an HB lead, but I bought Staedtler Mars Carbon 2B refills.

Overall, this is a fabulous choice, and cannot recommend it highly. If you are someone who cherishes their writing instruments and doesn't loose them, then this is a fabulous replacement for ye' ole wood pencil. If you are someone who could care less, I would implore you to consider yourself and your habits and maybe change them for nicer and longer lasting instruments such as this. :)",3,13.910296
355,I had trouble with this printer right from the start. It would not print multiple pages only one at a time. I operate with Windows 7. After talking with Brothers customer service several times the issue was still not resolved. I ended up taking the printer and my laptop to a computer repair store. They told me the disc with the download drivers that was sent with the printer was corrupt. The repair shop was able to get it to print eventually but I have to go through a several step process to make it work which is time consuming and a real pain.  All in all this has been a costly and disappointing experience with Brother. I do not recommend this printer.,12,4.9164824

I love that there are two open holes for handles so I can easily move my files without a problem. This is durable so I can put my files on the floor and they don't get damaged or wet if my toddler accidentally falls near me with a drink in hand (that's happened before).",5,3.5454073
357,"Pens, like some foods, are an acquired taste. Some folks are just not going to like writing with a utensil this thin so may reserve these for simple detail work or art projects. However, I actually like writing letters with these as it best highlights my cursive. I do get a cramp if I over grip as the barrel is quite thin. But as the market isn't flooded with .25 gel inks, this is the best fine line gel ink I've ever worked with. I started with a single color and then invested in this larger set. I'm a fan. The colors are so vibrant considering how thin they apply!

The flow can be, at times, a little jerky. Sometimes the way you're holding the pen or the paper used, will affect this and you'll experience mild skipping. If you want a pen to work perfectly smoothly, every time, and on every sort of paper, skip the more 'quirky' Slicci .25. Occasionally they have a mind of their own and this is probably another reason why I love them. I find they last quite awhile too, they obviously don't leave any bleed through (except on onion or tracing paper) and I haven't experienced any issues with them drying out prematurely.

If you're familiar with Pilot's Hi-Tec-C pens, these are very similar... but the tip on the Slicci is less flexible. That's good for some purposes but may feel too stiff for others. But I love the sturdiness of a 4mm (long) needle-tipped metal tip. Try one out before committing to the set.

They dry super fast too, which is a big bonus. They're very lightweight. The flow is 90% consistent and ideal for those who write tiny or desire precision. I am agog at how much writing, in so little space, these pens achieve. I've only used these on light colored paper so cannot vouch how they perform on darker paper or high cotton/pulpier papers or any non-paper  surface. See my attached pic for the colors.",31,8.021738
358,"I always have a hard time finding the right type of gel pens with the right thickness. The fine points are too fine and the medium tips are too ""fat"" for me. These pens are the perfect thickness. The ink flows nicely without excessive bleeding and no clumping. The pens are lightweight and easy to grip. If you have bigger hands, it might be a little awkward as these pens are fairly skinny. The colors are vibrant and bright while still being dark enough to read. The tips look like a needle but is not sharp at all. I have not had a problem with this scratching or cutting through paper.

The case holds the pens nicely and makes it easy to toss in my purse. It must be stored with the clips facing up in order to close all the way. The locks are a little weak. One of the locks no longer locks down but as long as one of them works, the case still stays closed.

A few improvements over this are evident compared to the older models.

1) This has a 'detection' for hands/fingers being stuck in it. Even a small baby or child can't get this to harm them as the sensor seems to detect HEAT. I can't verify the heat aspect but it really does seem to detect 'living' matter and turn itself off.
2) Auto-Turn on.. Turn it on, shred and walk away and within about 5 minutes this will turn off.. GREAT feature!
3) Much quieter basket. The basket is a honeycomb material that buffers sound very nicely compared to the older plastic ones.
4) Auto-Reshred.. Older ones jammed and had to be reversed, this one does it for you automatically. Very handy and you don't play the back and forth game with thick piles of paper.
5) Thickness meter. A nice feature is this will tell you at the outset if you are attempting to shred piles that are too large. The meter will spike up to red to show you the load is too high.

1. $100 is too much for what it is (a camera and a light).

Note:  My unit was NOT defective.  It was full functional but it was just horribly designed. Simply put- do not get this for photos that you care about...  I think most people who give this raving reviews have no idea how much better negatives can be reproduced with the technology out there.

Get the Epson V600 or the Canon 9000F MKII for under $200 which can reproduce REAL images from negatives with much larger resolutions.  The Epson has a horrible film holder but there are hacks that can fix this.  The Epson produces better colors, but the canon is a faster scanner.  Either way, both V600 and MKII can produce a 5MP photo that is light years better than this ""20MP"" film converter can do.

367,"I owned this printer less than a month and sent it back.

For: 1. Great price for a color laser printer.

2. Nice looking copies, especially photos.

3. Fast color photo printing.

Against: 1. Power consumption. It uses 11 amps of my 15 amp circuit when on. (Spec found on pg 87 of the PDF manual) It is like having a small space heater on all the time.

The lights flicker while the element stays hot. So I let it go into standby, which solved the flickering. When coming out of standby the power surge killed my ups (on the same circuit, but not powering the printer). Unless you have two circuits in your home office, beware.

2. No Surge Protection. The printer should not be plugged into a surge protector or ups. This is not stated in the manual, but you are told this by tech support when you call to complain about the flickering lights.

3. The time from warmup to print is 45 seconds. If you are only printing a couple of pages in black an inkjet is just as fast or faster. And the print quality isn't enough difference to be noticable for text.

4. Envelope printing. Typically home users print one or two envelopes at a time. To print an envelope, you have to take out all the paper, put in your envelope, move the slide, open the top, move two levers, close the top, and print. When you are done, reverse the process. In my HP inkjet, you put the envelope in the slot in the output tray and print.

According to the manual (pg. 23), ""laser"" envelopes only, lest they seal shut during printing. Staples has no such thing.

5. Lables. Precut or perforated lables need not apply. Whole uncut sheets only. (Pg 24)

6. Printable area. Normal margins = .157"" all around...except for legal paper in color mode, when the bottom margin = .409"". Since the printer is normally in color mode, it is one more thing to change when printing on legal and you need all the print area you can get or need an even print area.

7. Noise. It is extremely noisy when starting up or coming out of standby with a lot of loud clunking.

8. Tech Support. When I called about the power surge when coming out of standby (that caused the computer to reboot) I was told, ""Don't put in standby.""

On the second call to tech support for this problem I was told ""Plug it directly into the wall socket, not a surge protector or ups.""

When leaving it on caused the lights to flicker (Call 3), Tech Support Level 1 kept putting me on hold and relaying my questions to a Level 3 tech and relaying the answers back to me. The solution to the flickering lights...plug it into a different circuit. (Not an option in my home.)

Conclusion: For the average home office user that doesn't print a lot of color photos, get a good color inkjet. (I am partial to HP). For most printing needs it is just too much hassle.

If you do print color photos, just make sure you have a seperate circuit to plug it into.",21,13.976934
368,"No question that the optical quality of this scanner is excellent. However, a scanner is as dependent on good software as a film camera is dependent on good film, and Canon's scanning software is third-rate.

The 9950 greatly annoys me by offering a Full Platen scan but still chopping off part of the source even when it fits on the platen. It also does a tiresome rescan each time you zoom a preview, which the Epson didn't require. I have no idea why it is necessary to have a bright blue LED blinking while the scanner isn't in use.

371,"First, let me say that I love my WF-7110 printer!  It replaced my old Workforce 1100 which finally died with a paper handling malfunction, and I was able to buy the 7110 for less than what it would have cost to repair the 1100.

For me the best feature of the new printer is it's paper handling -- I can't believe how neat it is to have letter paper in the top tray, 11x17 in the bottom, and be able to print either with a smooth paper feed and very good print quality.  Auto-select for the right paper size to boot.

With my Epson WP-4540 all in one small office workhorse, I have been able to replace a very nice (but also very heavy and expensive) Brother MFC9840-CDW and my old Workforce 1100 for about the cost of two sets of toner cartridges for the Brother laser.

The ink cartridges on the 7110 are not large (4 carts, about the same size as on my old 1100), so we'll see how ink costs go -- but I know they will be significantly less than for a laser, and with better clarity in color than my Brother gave.  And having the two paper trays is very cool.  When I need I can have legal in the top, 11x17 or 13x19 in the bottom, and be set for anything with letter paper in the 4540.  The combination makes for a very nice and inexpensive home office setup for independent consultants such as myself.

A couple of quibbles.  First, it turns out that I couldn't simultaneously connect the printer via usb and wifi, although I have no idea why, & the manual says you can set up both.  It could, of course, be something in the ATT U-verse/Hotspot/Wifi/Ethernet setup that I have at home.  Anyhow I was able to set the printer to wifi for use with all the devices I have in the house -- 2 desktops, 2 notebooks, an iPad, a Nook HD, a Kindle Fire HD, and a Kindle paperwhite.  All good, although I haven't set up Epson Connect yet for the android mobiles.

 The second issue, and more of a pain to me, was the clunky screen interface to enter passwords in order to enable wifi.  Since there's no numeric keypad on the printer, you have to scroll through uppercase alphabet and then special characters for each digit, and if you want to use lower case and numbers, you have to use the Stop key to shift to that function.  Maybe with a short simple password this is ok, but with ATT's U-verse, they use a long complicated password with upper case,lower case and a whole bunch of special characters.  Great for security, but a real pain to input into the 7110.

That's it.  I love my WP-7110 with it's great paper handling, the ability to print with folio and larger (up to 13x19) paper, and the very nice print quality.  And for $150 on sale, I'm not really even griping over the password entry system. I am amazed at what Epson has put into an inexpensive package.",3,8.8068

The only hitch I have run into with them, is they are best applied on top of a base coat similar to their color (I use Tombow markers for this). Otherwise, their subtle sheen seems to be absorbed by the paper.

389,"I absolutely love this pen. So to get started, lets clarify what is the size point of the nib? The listing says fine, the community says medium or fine. Well the nib is labeled as fine, but for comparison it is not as fine as say the pilot metropolitan, but it is also not as medium as the Jinhao 1200 (gold pen with dragon & red eyes). So it lands somewhere in the middle of those two and you can see the difference in the picture that I've added. It's slightly bolder than the fine, yet not as bold as the medium.

 Next this pen weighs in at a whopping 3 ounces. If you own the Jinhao 1200, it weights 2 ounces. Even though this pen is heavier, I actually like it better than the Jinhao 1200, because the weight feels more evenly distributed. In the Jinhao 1200 a good portion of weight is in the cap and more towards the nib. The weight distribution in this pen however makes it more comfortable. Where your fingers rest when holding they touch part of the dragon design and for some this may be uncomfortable when writing. I am currently using the Jinhao international cartridges with this pen and it writes wonderfully. I can write at a normal angle and it does not skip. That being said, I think if it is skipping then it may be one of a few things either the ink being used or there may be an issue with the nib itself.

 The ""jade"" is fake in case you are  unsure. I can't quite tell if the ball is plastic or if it is glass like a marble. It does shake when writing, but I plan on either putting a dab of clear glue under it or some other method to keep it from shaking.  The box that it comes in is very nice. The box I received is not what is pictured, at least on the inside. It does not have the insert in the middle, its just flat with a ribbon to hold the pen. (I've added a picture of the box). Overall though I am happy with this pen and it seems to be of good quality.",2,8.893252
390,"On the face of it, this seems like a great kit. You receive a pen, three nibs, and four colors of ink. My problem with the kit is it has every problem imaginable.

First, I decided to start with black ink and the fine nib. I couldn't get the pen started. In fact I spent so long trying to do so, I stopped and examined the pen for some type of deficiency. Finding none, I switched to the medium nib and repeated the process. Still finding no deficiency, I allowed the pen to rest nib down for about ten minutes.

To my surprise, it did not gush everywhere after this resting period, and I still had to make multiple strokes to get a good flow. Now we are getting somewhere, or so I thought. This pen skips, badly. Only after three quarters of a page did the skipping decrease but that is not saying much, it still a terrible skipper.

I also find it to be feathery, with too long a dry time, but the skips are killing it. I absolutely can't deal with this amount of skipping. In short, this is a highly disappointing pen. I do not recommend it to anyone unless they are required to purchase a gift for someone they don't like. If you want to annoy and frustrate a co-worker you don't like, this is an excellent way to do it.",46,6.615017

It's almost like using a permanent marker.

You can easily remove the old dry erase markings without purchasing any special cleaners. Just retrace over the old markings with a whiteboard marker and you'll be able to remove them.

400,"I have all four of these pens in my possession and they have a number of flaws.

1. There is no converter for these pens.  What Pilot misleadingly labels ""converter"" is actually a rubber bladder for cleaning only.  The packaging states very clearly ""Converter* (for cleaning pen unit)"".  However, this is not visible in the advertised picture, and in my opinion Pilot should be ashamed of itself for calling a cleaning bladder a converter.
2. The supplied ink is very very wet.  My guess (and it is only that) is that this wet ink is required because of the parallel plate design.  However, because the ink is so wet, one does not obtain a good contrast between thick and thin lines because wet ink spreads too much making the thinest link too thick for my taste.  I am doubtful that drier (more traditional) inks could be used but this is informed speculation.
3. The pens and packaging are cheaply made in my opinion.  In fairness, this is reflected in the price.
4. The packaging is flimsy, and more importantly, it cannot be used to store a pen containing ink because the package cannot receive a capped pen.  Moreover, the packaging is not easy to open or to reuse.  I had to open the surrounding clear plastic box with a razor, trim off both ends of the clear plastic with scissors, and repurpose the plastic cover as a sleeve -- all for nought, since the assembled pen can't be place back in the packaging anyway.
5. The tip cannot affix to the body of the pen when it is in use.  The tapered body is much smaller than the cap.  Moreover, the cap is threaded rather than press fit to the pen.  This is probably required (again, my guess) due to the fact that the ink is so wet a threaded seal is required to keep too much water from evaporating and clogging the parallel leaves.

In short, I am disappointed with the wetness of the ink, the quality of the pen, and the quality of the lines it generates.  I didn't give the pens a 1-star rating however, because I think the price -- less than $7 each, mitigates the value engineering.  Notwithstanding, I would rather pay more for a higher quality pen.",2,14.161335

402,"I used these clear address labels to address hundreds upon hundreds of envelopes.
I used the corresponding Avery template, which was easy to use.
And mostly - everything turned out great.

I'm not sure why because the template looks good and all the other addresses on the sheets would print out perfectly, and there was no distortion of the fonts and the lines were straight so I don't believe it was an issue with the printer itself.  Who knows...
Not a deal breaker.  Printed well on my laser printer, and I think the ink dried fairly quickly on it because I didn't have any smudging, nor did I try.

405,"I ordered the hp Envy 114 in July of this year (2012), but only installed it today.  I ordered it because I was unhappy with the speed that my Kodak ESP 5250 sucked ink cartridges, but I had ordered spares for IT, so had to wait until that ink was gone to install the Envy.  I have a Mac, and I would like to say first and foremost, it installed with perfect ease.  I appreciate that the installation cd that came with it was also for Mac, oftentimes they are Windows-only.  My android phone printed a photo on the Envy 114 without a hitch.  I didn't use photo paper, due to it being a ""test,"" but the two photos still came out pretty nice.  The few forms and things I've test-printed have printed out very nicely, with BLACK print.  The Kodak printed text in gray, for some unknown reason.  I've had several hp printers in the past, and was happy with the duration of ink cartridges (used 23 and 45) in those.

The only complaint I have at this early point of usage is that the so-called touch screen is VERY difficult to use.  I had to totally mash down on it during setup, and never could get it to set the correct time.  I used my finger, a pencil eraser, and my fingernail (gently, not wanting to damage it), and nothing worked well.  When you first plug it in, the first selection is what language you prefer.  I had to literally smash ""English"" to get it to work.  The touch screen issue could be that I had it sitting here next to my desk since July, but that was only four months, and I would think that some stores have them on their shelves for that long sometimes?***See update below.....

I do love the quietness of this printer.  It is somewhat heavier than any other I've owned previously, but as someone already said, that's possibly what helps make it quieter than most.  Plus it's nice-looking, sleek and a lot more compact than older models.

On a side note, thanks to all of you who faithfully write reviews.  I don't purchase ANYthing without reading them, and don't post nearly as many reviews as I should.  I live in a small town, and have ordered from Amazon forever.  So, please, keep posting reviews - - they mean everything to people considering a purchase!  I will try to remember to update this review as I continue using the Envy 114.

***Now that I've used the printer for a few months, I wanted to say that the touch screen feature is working more easily - might be because I've ""learned"" how to press the areas.  It's not a sensitive touch screen, but it IS functional and is a minor detraction from an otherwise great printer.

After a few months of use, my original ink cartridges are still holding up, and I used it quite a lot for printing photos in December.

The paper-feed feature is a bit awkward, you can't put a whole lot of paper in at once - so for large print jobs, you will be having to re-fill the paper tray.  Not a detraction from the product if you are aware of it before purchasing.

A ""color"" Palm works best for some game features like for viewing the actual Scrabble Board as it is seen in reality, with the colored tile squares.  The Palm is small and works nicely.  After having it, I became aware that it can also be used for an address/phone book and that it interfaces with the computer via its own computer program so one can synch computer entries with the Palm OR one can make changes to the Palm Info then synch that info with the computer info.

We are asked to post our instructional focus to be visible for the students, which is difficult to do when you have 5 groups from K-4 in 3.5 hours and a small intervention room as a classroom.  I decided to buy these ticket holders and construct a PVC pipe holder as a standing mini flip chart with each group's focus in a ticket holder.  The kids also work with partners as soon as they come into my room and now they only need to look at the flip chart to see who they are working with and we can get right to work.

Although I am happy with those, I think in the future I will buy these shop ticket holders for dry-erase work.  The ticket holders don't look quite as nice, but I don't think the others are going to last through much more than 2 school years before they won't come clean anymore.  These ticket holders are more economical and I think they are just as sturdy.",10,9.554854
417,"Very nice All-In-One.  It prints beautifully; crisp, clear, & bold.  The photo printer works as well as my stylus photo printer.  Great detail and color to the pictures.  The fax works fine.  I've faxed a couple of things.  One had ten pages and I'm not sure if it was this fax or the fax on the other end, but while faxing the ""transmission  was interrupted""  so I had to refax the last few pages.  The scanner works OK.  I've only used it twice to copy recipes from a book and they were clear.  The print speed is good but not super speedy.  It faxes a little slowly.  It is also a little noisy but not obnoxiously so.  The set up and connection to my Mac was easy.  No tricky requirements.  I've had it for about 10 days & so far it is working seamlessly.  It has a relatively small footprint and looks very sleek.  Ink is easy to load too but not cheap. I like the separate cartridges. You will need a USB cord though.",40,8.415653

But they were shipped loose in a small bubble-wrapped envelope that had split open before it reached me; someone at the post office rubber-banded it back together. The casing meant to hold the pencil shavings was broken on 2 of them, but I fixed one with super glue.

419,"This Desk is perfect size for those who enjoy a clutter-free work zone since there's just enough space for the essentials.  Assembly is pretty quick and easy. No additional tools are required for it.  I would say it's a two person job, just to hold the leg straight while screwing in, but some may disagree. The seller delivered this sooner than promised from overseas which was a pleasant surprise. The directions are just simple pictures which makes assembly a breeze if you are like me and prefer visual, rather than a bunch of directive steps to follow. There's just the desktop, 4 legs, 2 crossbars, 4 risers/feet, screws, washers and the tool involved.

I would offer a few quick tips if I may;
-First, make certain that the holes on the legs for the crossbars are facing inside and each other.  It's not depicted in the pictures, but otherwise it's no big deal to unscrew the legs and invert them to fix the problem.  It's just an avoidable hassle.

-Second, each leg requires 2 screws into each corner of the desktop.  So, I advise you screw the bottom screw in first.  If you do this, life is a breeze and the top screw goes in nicely.  If not, it takes a little more time and effort as you go since you will then be working the bottom screw around the top with an allen wrench.

In closing, this is a great find for it's pricepoint and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone.  Also, I would definitley purchase this again after my positive experience all around.",12,6.2180443
420,"** Update September 2014

I bought this printer in October 2012. Less than two years of light home-office use, and it's dying. Intermittent error messages requiring unplug and restart, missing whole lines when printing text, stripy graphics printing. I have only ever used genuine Epson ink, and the current cartridges are all near-new. I have been through the whole gamut of troubleshooting actions - basically this printer is kaput and not economically repairable.

I have downgraded my original four-star rating to one-star, because I think a two year life span for a device like this is economically and environmentally unacceptable.

---------------------------------

Out of the box, setup on a Win7 machine involved installing software off a disk, updating and registering software, and connection to a wireless home network. Easy, but took about 40-minutes. Still, it's a job you only do once. I have also connected this printer via WiFi with a laptop running Linux, and the two machines play together nicely.

Not going to go on about specs, you can read these easily enough in the product information or at the manufacturer's website, but here are some I'll mention;

- The touch screen is nice and clear, but seldom used for anything except copying.
- Auto document feeder works well, and has a tricky flap-up cover which reduces dust ingress and makes the printer look good when not in use.
- Auto duplex has been on my printer wish-list for a long time, and this one works well. It even pauses to allow ink to dry before flipping over.
- Scanning software is not the greatest, I'm finding this a little cumbersome and not particularly intuitive.
- Remote document printing via email and Google Cloud Print has been useful for me.
- I'm very happy with photo print quality.

PAPER TRAY MANAGEMENT

This printer, as shipped, defaults to tray 1, which is fine if you only print Letter or A4. But if you want to use one tray for photo paper and the other for Letter, you'll find that only tray 1 has guides for smaller paper sizes. This means every time you want to print a document, you have to manually change to tray 2 via Properties. There are lots of posts from frustrated users about this issue in online forums, mainly because changing the default paper tray is not intuitive, and in MacOS may not even be possible.

For Windows users, to change the default paper tray to tray 2, go to the Notification Area (that line of icons on the right-hand side of the Task Bar, usually next to the clock at the bottom of the screen). Click on the little up-arrow to show hidden icons, then click on the printer icon. Select ""Printer Settings"" from the pop-up menu, and in the dialog box select Cassette 2 as your paper source, then click OK. By the way, this information is in the electronic user manual.

-- Additional notes added October 19, 2012; I've used Epson's ""Epson Connect"" remote printing a few times, where you can email your document as an attachment to your printer's own (easy to set up) email address. Very useful, but this utility insists on using Cassette 1 regardless of your defaults. I can't find any way of overcoming this.

421,"I have owned this printer for 7 years now. I came close to returning it the first week because I was spoiled by my Canon S9000 which is pretty much WYSIWYG.  Here's my review:

This printer is a bit of an orphan. It is too complicated and costly for people expecting plug-n-print results, but it is too small (13 inch carriage) to enter the ranks of pro gear.

If you do not know how to use or obtain profiles, don't bother. The built-in profiles for Canon media are not very good, either.

If you don't have Photoshop or PhotoPaint, and just want to print JPGs of your kids, save your money and get a $100 printer at a big box store.

If you call Canon tech support, be sure to specify that it is the Pixma Pro. They only have a few techs that specialize in this printer.

Having said that, if you do meet all these conditions, are comfortable with color management, and understand the limitations of various media, you can get wonderful results. But be sure you have some other task to do once you hit print, because this printer is slooooww. I feel like the Pope in ""The Agony and The Ecstasy"" asking Michelangelo, ""When will it be finished?""

My only real gripe is with the software and firmware. Canon has this silly notion that you can't print border-to-border on l3 x 19 media, so it tries to impose a 35 mm border. You can circumvent this by specify a non-art media type, and then twiddling the settings. Important: always check the block in the printer driver that says preview. That has saved me $$ in paper and ink as I've caught something that was not evident on-screen in my app.

Since I wrote my first review, the Canon software updates mean that if a cart reports as ""out"" you cannot print until you replace it. Even if you are printing grayscale, you must replace any other cart(s) that go out. It also cleans itself as often as a cat, so that uses more ink. Just remember, there are no printer companies, just ink companies that also sell printers.

I have not replaced this, because, despite my frustrations with this device, it serves its purpose and the replacements Canon has introduced since this device offer no real advantages to a  prosumer like me. I can't recommend buying this used at top dollar from a retailer, but if you can get a well-maintained unit from a private seller, and are willing to feed the 9500's ink jones (115USD a set) , you might like the results.",4,14.317783

427,"The first impression of this calculator is it being outdated and cheaply build.  Held next to an HP 48gx,  or the 15C, the plastic molding of the 50g's case is cheap. The battery door is very flimsy. The keys do feel as nice as those old HP calculators.

The return key has been ""misplaced"" on the bottom right. HP folks had rearranged the keyboard layout and this takes time to get used to. Placing the return key at the lower corner is bad.  This makes it hard to hold the calculator and use two thumbs for input as the right hand has to hold close to the lower edge making a rather insecure and clumsy way of operating the calculator.

Functionality wise, the 50g is loaded with more build-in programs than the 48 series calculators and the CAS is nice and assessable right in the home screen. Sometimes, as an engineer,  I don't care for the neatness of showing the result in the rational algebraic form or the likes and rather have just the numerical results. This entails extra key strokes.

The keys don't feel very nice but serviceable and the printings on the key against the back background are easy to see even in dimmly lit conditions.

The low resolution screen is an eye sore.  Decades after the 48 series, I though it should have been upgraded.

The worst part is the documentation.  It's operation is not close to the older HP calculators so I have to consult the manual and the manual is on a CD meaning that  I need to have either the computer on or read it on my iPhone after downloading a odd copy. Needing to have either on, I might as well use the computer or an app on the phone. A build-in manual like that on the HP Prime would make a lot of sense.

This machine is also bulky; sized similarly to the 48 series. I have this and the Prime and find myself going for the Prime most of the time.",2,7.949256

I find them much more durable than glassine or cello bags/envelopes and much smoother, as well.

I also use these for putting together presentation books, or for storing materials (class handouts, etc.) when I'm not quite as concerned about archival issues or long-term durability or strength.

I think these are great for the price. I don't think they would stand up to regular use in a binder for a long period of time because the plastic they are made from is fairly thin, and would likely tear at the holes if being flipped over and over, but for temporary use, or for ""disposable"" use, they are great.",2,6.0631323

I did not have any trouble with the cartridges on my brother mfc-240c printer and the quality was comparable to the OEM ones. I just noticed that sometimes (once every six months or so), the printer would say I have no more ink when I could still hear a significant amount inside the cartridge. I solved this problem by sticking masking tape at the back of the cartridge where you could see the ink level. I suppose they have some laser light technology thing to check the ink level. Anyway, I got to squeeze out every drop (or most of it) of ink out of the cartridge.
I would estimate that these cartridges run out 25% faster than the OEM ones, but at this price, I could buy three times the OEM, so it not only balances out but also goes into savings.",5,7.249777

The ink flow is really generous and I find it difficult to control.  The ink bleeds to the next space unless you are very careful.  The bleed to the back of the paper is something I was expecting but my first page bled through two pieces of paper I had placed underneath. The chisel end is much better than a brush tip for me and the pens do cover large areas well.  The colors are muted..but still pretty I guess. Way to many grey shades.

Seriously.

My two young teenaged boys pulled this out for me since I had procrastinated, and I observed as they spent about ten minutes getting everything put together (things like plugging in the cord and inserting the printer cartridges) and running the printing test.

I spent maybe 5 minutes following the incredibly easy instructions to get the printer onto my network, and then we were able to print.  Flawlessly.  We have not had a single problem printing anything in the past two months.

Double-sided printing (or copying) is so incredibly simple and far faster than I expected.  Making copies is intuitive.  Scanning is easy.

The only thing we haven't tried is using it to fax... because that is just something we don't do.

This sharpener takes a little getting used to and there is probably going to be a lot of trial and error with it but if you take time getting to know it by testing it out with regular graphite pencils it doesn't take long to figure out how to best use it.  It does give super long tips (even with Prismacolors) but you have to remember that if you are a heavy handed artist your tips are going to break pretty easily.  They even break if you aren't heavy handed but they can also work fairly well too.

All of my pencils fit into this which was one of the things I worried about as my Coloursoft pencils are rather big.  Yes the little clamp that holds the pencil as you sharpen will leave a little indentation in the pencil but I didn't have any issues with that.

444,"After putting up with dreadful phones by Motorola for 4 years, I did thorough research before buying this one.  I read numerous reviews.  Then I compared the features under Specifications and made a list of the ones I thought would be important to me.  Price was not one of them.. My daughter recommended Panasonic for their reliability and I had a similar bias.  So I really just checked out all the Panasonic phones.

These were the features important to me;

1.  The cost of batteries.  This is because I had to spend $15-18 for each Motorola battery and I was replacing them every 9 mos. or so.  These Panasonics use Rechargeable AAA batteries.  These are still specialized and cost more than ordinary AAA batteries but not $15!  I haven't had the phones long enough to comment on how long they last.

2. Sound Quality.  Some people complained about that on their phones and it was important to me because some friends call me on their cell phones and have somewhat nasal voices.  I basically find these satisfactory.  I'd give them an A-.  I think it is the DECT 6 technology that accounts for the high quality. You can also BOOST the quality if you're in an area with interference.

3. I wanted the biggest possible phonebook.  This takes 70 numbers.  Some of the other Panasonics accept only 50, which I find to be too few as you can have to enter some people 3 times--home, work and cell, and maybe vacation home.  I don't know why cordless phones can't do what cell phones do with their phone books.  This is my one complaint.  A good thing though--when you enter a phone number in one phone it is automatically entered in all of them!

4.  The handsets and base are backlit and have BIG numbers.  Awesome!

5.  There are speaker phone features on all handsets and the handset can stand up on their own. My Motorolas didn't and this allows you to write while you talk.

6.  There is spoken (as well as written) Caller ID.  I thought this would be great but it turns out I can't understand the name.  This is because it is a digitized voice.  I am sticking with it for now on the theory I will learn to adapt, like you learn to understand a small child with practice.  If I don't, I can turn it off.

7.  It has 4-way conferencing on this model.

8.  You can silence the ring on any or all phones between certain hours--for sleep or naps, etc..

9.  Caller ID is stored in memory so you can find out who called and call back later.  Basic, I guess.

10. Phones stay on for 2 hours during an outage.

11.  Call Waiting actually works.  You just hit the Flash button.  It never worked on my Motorolas!

Some other incidental features; volume can be controlled on each handset; each phone has  a nice big flashing message light.  All other usual features exist.

I had to set the date & time manually.  It kept deferring to Grenwich time!  See Instruction book.

I hope this was helpful.  I no longer can drive (due to a stroke) so I am a big Amazon fan.  Going through the information available on line and reading people's comments is SO helpful.  I am making better choices than I did going into stores! If you have any questions email me.",74,14.574153

450,"This is my second Internet Phone Adapter.  My first was a Cisco WRP400-G1, which is also a Wireless 4 Port Router. It was connected directly to the Internet and proved to be trouble free in terms of setup.  Just required power cycling it on and off after initial setup.

The Linsys/Cisco PAP2T on the other hand is just an ATA (Analog Phone Adapter) without router capability, and in my case is connected to the internet through a Dlink DIR-825 Router.  The PAP2T is surprisingly compact.

I initially struggled for some time to get it to Register with my VOIP provider.  I flashed the latest Firmware upgrade, then it wouldn't capture an IP Address from my Router.  After finally rebooting the Router it was able to get an IP Address and Register itself with my VOIP Provider. All told it took over an hour.  I consider myself to above average in computer knowledge so I would say this device is not for the casual computer user.

Setup requires that you have a Network Router or Switch between the ATA and your internet Cable/DSL Modem, or whatever connection you have to the network. You cannot for example just plug it into Network Connection on your computer or Laptop.  You will also need a phone connected to it to be able to access the IP Address that is assigned when you plug it into your Router. Type **** into the phone followed by 110#.  The ATA will then tell you what IP Address has been assigned by the Router, for example 192.168.0.3.  This is not a permanent IP Address and could change whenever the device is powered off or disconnected from your Router, should you need to access the setup again, for example after a Firmware upgrade.  The Router will assign whatever address is available when you attach the device.  Once you have the IP Address type it into the heading of your Internet Browser (Explorer, Firefox, Safari, etc.), making sure to do this from a computer that is connected to the same Router.  This will allow you to enter the setup screen in the ATA.  From there you will just have to the follow the directions from your VOIP Provider.

Once you setup the unit and can get it to Register, you should theoretically be able to connect it directly to a Cable/DSL Modem without the Router, if you were so inclined.

Although I cannot be certain the Firmware Upgrade was the solution, or whether it was just a matter of me doing something wrong in the setup, it did seem to help. In hindsight I should have just done it from the start.  The setup screen also functioned much better after the Firmware upgrade.  There were lags and hang ups when I attempted to Save during the setup prior to the upgrade, this did not happen after.",4,9.327833

However, anyone in the office is capable of printing to it wirelessly via our WiFi connectivity, HP ePrint App or NFC devices.

Installation took a while.  It takes 20 minutes just for the ink cartridges to initialize after being inserted.  My Windows 7 computer immediately recognized it when I plug it in.  However I went directly to the website to make sure I had the most updated driver available.  It installed the PCL 6 driver version which caused issues with a specific software I use at work.  The printer worked perfectly with Microsoft Office 2010, but I could not print invoices or reports from our company software.  After spending what seemed to be hours trying to play with the settings and configurations, I finally updated and downloaded the Windows drivers and installed the HP Color LaserJet Family PCL 5 driver and now it responds.  I am still able to use all the cool functions like apps and scanning, but limited on printing options when it comes to the printer properties (settings) on my computer.

Next step was setting up the HP Connect account online and allowing devices to print remotely.  This was a bit time consuming as well since you have to add email account accounts and then they have to verify them.  There are also other cool features such as apps you can download for printing out calendars, coloring pages, forms, etc.

The paper tray (2) can hold a ream of paper (500 sheets).  It has a separate tray (1) that opens for envelopes, checks, irregular sized paper, etc.  I am keeping an eye out when they will offer additional trays so I can add a legal size since I use that size on a regular basis.

The printer does have a quiet mode, scan to email, scan to USB and lots of other functions that are too many to name.  All controlled by a colored touch screen pad.  The only feature I can not comment on is the fax features since I do not have it connected to a phone line.

It comes with starter ink cartridges.  Not sure how long they will last, but the normal cartridges are suppose to last up to 3500 pages of printing.  They run about $80 per cartridge, but if they last that long you should not have to be replacing them often.

The only thing I do not like is that it takes a while for it to start printing, but when it starts printing the pages come out quickly.  It is like it has to warm up for every print job.

There is a login setting on the printer to protect it.  Some features like job storage and scan to email feature requires entering a pin number.  The instructions are hard to find.  You can find the job storage under set preferences menu on the install HP software.  For scanning to email you have to go to your printer's IP address,  Then go to Settings > Security > Access Control >Printer User Accounts and add new user.  This is not an option I am using.

Overall excellent multi function printer with tons of options.

UPDATE April 11, 2016:  I contacted HP because I was really disappointed I could not use all the features having to use a different driver.  I wanted to know if an update for a PCL 5 was going to be done.  She told me to go to hp (dot) com/go/upd and download the universal driver for my operating system and chose the PCL 5 driver option.  I HAVE MY FEATURES BACK!!!!!  I am now able to take advantage of most printing options and goodies in the printer properties menu.",34,11.131947

457,"This product is essentially a rip off as it does not compare to the other ink cartridges of the same HP number sold for more money.  You get what you pay for and in this case there was no HP box (in fact it appeared to be an old and small cartridge that comes with new printers).  There was no expiration date but there was a size of only 7 ml listed on the odd shrink wrap packaging.  The worst problem though is that I have just printed about twenty 4x6 inch prints and am already receiving low ink warnings from the printer.  Amazon needs to be consistent and inform the consumer that this is a small ink cartridge compared to those for more money.  I wonder if the sale of this cartridge is even allowed by HP.  If you are going to take the time and trouble to order and change cartridges, it should be with a real size cartridge that will not be empty after 25 small prints.

459,"The box does only what it says it's supposed to do -- keeps file papers under lock and key. The box is a very light gauge metal (lunch box grade), easily bent or dented and has a minimal lock mechanism with just a rudimentary bar of metal as a latch. This is an low security storage box -- seems like anyone with a screwdriver could pry the lid open. Both rails for the file dividers are actually set far from each other and are too low in the box -- file dividers pop right off the rails as the base of the dividers rest right on the box bottom, and the hangar ends of the dividers won't sit securely within the rail tracks. I had to gingerly use pliers to adjust both tracks so the dividers set in place. If potential water damage is a factor, the holes for the handle clasps and the piano hinge at the back of the lid are open to the inside, so if rainstorm damage or office sprinklers could be a problem for valuable papers, this box just won't provide protection. I'm being picky about these details, especially at this low price (and especially utilizing Amazon's free shipping) but all of these items might have been taken care of at the outset, making for a more satisfactory and secure box.",4,9.076125

Can't wait for a printer-maker to adopt a different approach: reasonably priced cartridges which will bring up the volume of their printer sales up immediately. Not much hope there too as the printer makers have colluded to keep the prices up and rip off the consumers. No light at the end of the tunnel ;-)",3,5.608377

So, why would anyone want to print their own postage for 10 cents more, per stamp, than it would cost if you if you bought regular stamps?

Some people may say ""It's just convenient"".  Really... Is it that hard to buy a roll of stamps?  You can get them in lots of places, not just the Post Office.

Until recently, I was able to print postage using my Dymo label maker using generic labels, which were MUCH cheaper, but they now block you from using them by requesting an activation code from their more expensive labels.

Fine points are the best and my favorite. I bought these for my assistant to use and she prefers medium point.  What makes a Paper Mate great is its consistency over the years.  They are lightweight, portable, throw-aways when the ink runs out.  You can get them on sale for pennies.  And the ink never clumps nor tips ever dry out no matter how long  ago you've lost the cap.  I have these in every color.  Paper Mate is my go-to pen product if I could only choose one. Whoever invented these was a genius.  Such a simple design that is consistently fabulous.

I did not have to fiddle with any EQ controls to make the calls intelligible. Display is nice and bright and the keypad lights (backlight) up nicely for night use. In fact I have used this as a quick flashlight at times. Characters are large enough and legible. There is a bit of delay when dialing and hearing the tone but one gets used to this very quickly. Talk time ... I have yet to run down the batteries .... two calls in a row ... one for over two hours and the next was one hour. Quick charge time. Takes 2 rechargeable AAA Ni-MH batteries. DO NOT USE Ni-Cads in this phone! Reception distance was incredible! I took one phone and walked down the block. As long as I could see my office on the second story I had clear reception ... so over a block away from the house I was able to make crystal clear calls! Panasonic has always been my choice for cordless phones and this latest phone system gets a big thumbs up!

January 19, 2013 update ... OK here's what caused me to drop the rating to a one start from a five star. I thought it was just a fluke but despite accurately setting the time and date ... by itself the phone sets will reset to another time and date ... should be Jan 19, 2013 .... it went by itself to April 11, 2013. Time was supposed to be 11:49 am but it had reset to 10:49 PM ... no kids in the house and the phone set is on a professional UPS power conditioner. Also noticed that one handset was starting to charge without having been in use (charging LED stayed on for some time). Have a call into Panasonic. Will keep you posted.

January 21, 2013 update ... good news but not for Panasonic online support ... 4 days later and no reply. I contacted them today and the problem with the phone was that it was not set to manual time. In other words if you go through Google Voice and get a call and you have the phone set for caller ID time it will change the time and date to April 13 incorrectly ... at least for my phone this week. How to fix it: grab your handset and hit the # key, type in 226 and set the cursor to ""manual"" and save. You can exit that menu (""OFF"" key) and hit then hit # and then 101 to change date and time. So far its working great! Back to five stars.

473,"I have been doing a lot of highlighting at work recently, and I have highlighters from half a dozen manufacturers in my pen mug at work.  I suppose one of the benefits of retractable highlighters (this one included) is that there's no cap to lose.  Also, these in particular don't dry out because there's a little internal flap that covers the tip when the tip is retracted.  That's actually a very nice feature.

What I don't care for about retractable highlighters (again, this type included) is that they're narrow.  I understand why; it would be difficult to make the retractability work on a highlighter that was wider in diameter.  But most of my highlighting has been on 12-point text (from printed Excel worksheets), and these highlighters are a bit too narrow to effectively highlight 11- or 12-point text.  I think also because they're narrow, they don't hold as much ink as the fat highlighters, and they tend not to last quite as long for that reason.

What these highlighters are particularly good at is highlighting very small text.  For example, I have to read a lot of patents and published patent applications, and the text in those tends to be rather small.  I also sometimes have to look at tables in scientific journals, and that text is also quite small.  I tend to use these narrower highlighters for applications like those.  They make nice, clean lines, and they don't bleed too much.  Assuming they've been properly retracted, they also don't easily dry out.

Overall, I like these fairly well, though they are not suitable for every situation I encounter at work, so I will hang on to a couple of fat, non-retractable highlighters, too.",3,8.998375

The pencil has 2.5=HB lead, and the darkness is just right - not too light nor dark. The best feature of this pencil is the grip feature in the form of little black circular grooves that enable the user to have a firm grip on the pencil.

484,"OK, I agree with everyone that Epson makes pretty good ink.  Photos come out looking good, and they are archival inks as well.  So far so good.

What irks me is that even if I've been overwhelmingly using black ink, when it is used up the printer won't start up until I replace both the black & color cartridges.  In fact, Epson settled a class-action suit because the printer would require you to replace both cartridges EVEN WHEN THERE WAS ENOUGH INK LEFT IN THEM.  So I ended up having to replace both cartridges when there was no reason to replace either of them, so Epson could sell more high-priced ink. What do I get out of it if I send in my claim?  $40 in Epson products, or enough for one set of ink cartridges.

Well, I've bought the last Epson ink I'll ever buy, and the last Epson printer, too.  What's the point of having separate cartridges if you have to change them at the same time?  Epson has nothing to gain by abusing its customers.

I've since replaced my Epson inkjet with a Brother B&W network laser printer that I'm very happy with, and if I want color photos I upload them to my neighborhood drug store, where my photos are ready in one hour for less cost than printing them on Epson photo paper.

Colors are decent, crisp but not professional level, with fair saturation but nothing extraordinary. The printer is easy to set up, basically plug and play, and grabs our wireless signal easily around three corners and through a closed door. It's relatively large but not too heavy, and quite solidly made.

We have another HP printer, and they both have the same issue, which almost all printers now have: the massively overpriced replacement cartridges. This printer claims to use ""up to 50% less"" ink than lasers, but that still adds up to about five cents per page, not insane but not cheap either. The reason printers sell pretty cheaply these days is because all the money is made by selling the ink in proprietary cartridges, at prices 3 to 5 times higher than you'd pay for generic or refilled carts. Which really isn't very equitable.

So I would recommend this printer for occasional home use, as it does print well and quite quickly. But if speed is an issue, you're better off buying a more expensive printer that takes generic refillable cartridges, because in the long run you'll save a LOT of money.

TIP: Unless you must have heavy black printing, always set your printers to use the lightest print setting and you'll end up saving a ton of money. Also, colors cost more, so unless you must have color, simple black and white will also save you money over the long haul.

As far as reliability goes, our two year old HP printer is still working well, so that bodes well for this one. If something goes wrong I'll come back here and mention it.",67,8.696976

508,"First and foremost, if you are looking for purely Personal Information Management (PIM) functions and not generally inclined towards Linux, then do yourself a favor and buy yourself a Palm Pilot.
The Zaurus is basically a mini Linux workstation with a lot of functionality you would normally find only on a desktop. With the Zaurus, you can:
* Browse the web with a scalable and full featured browser
* Read and edit MS-Office documents (Word, Excel and Powepoint)
* Write and execute scripts and programs (including Java)
* Play music and video
* Control your desktop Windows PC (using VNC software)
It is so powerful that you can actually use it as a Web or file server (using Apache and Samba). I use my Zaurus to administrate my Linux server and Oracle database server when I am away from my desk.
Plus there are tons of applications, utilities, games, etc., that you can download. Zaurus has a very active user community forum (check the links from the Sharp Zaurus official web sites) where you can get a lot of useful tips from.
Having said all that, the PIM functions that came with the Zaurus were pretty poor compared with the Palm Pilot. This lead me to hang on to my Palm Vx for dear life. I even took the drastic step of downloading and installing a Palm Pilot emulator (called QPose) onto my Zaurus. The performance hit on the Zaurus was so bad that I had to delete QPose and instead carry both my Palm Vx and Zaurus with me.
However, now that Sharp has released a new ROM (v3.10, as of May 15, 2003, see below) the PIM functions have vastly improved. So much that I am now inclined to keep my Palm at home and take only the Zaurus along.
Upon getting your Zaurus, do yourself a favor and install the terminal and file manager applications that come in the CD. The terminal application enables you to do a lot of tweaking and is mandatory if you plan to use the Zaurus to its full capabilty. It actually comes with a basic Linux shell environment and comes with such neat utilities as vi editor, ftp and telnet clients, ping, and a large number of Linux/Unix tools.
Another application I found very useful is called ""rotation"". It enables you to rotate the application screens by 90 degrees, making such things as web browsing, file editing and using the terminal appication a lot more pleasing and functional. You can download the ""qpe-rotation"" and ""qt-embedded-rotation"" files (ipks) from the ZaurusSoft website.
Also, an important suggestion to existing SL-5500 users:
Sharp has just released the latest ROM (v3.10, May 15, 2003) which makes the SL-5500 look and behave like the newer SL-5600. I *strongly urge* SL-5500 users with the old ROM (v2.38) to download and install this new ROM. The user interface with the new ROM is a lot cleaner and neater and has more stable applications (including a vastly improved Opera browser and much better PIM applications).",36,14.102753
509,"Replacing toner cartridges can be so expensive that I decided to look for an aftermarket replacement for toners for my Samsung C410 colored laser printer. I was reluctant to purchase this at first as the reviews seemed to be mixed. I'm so glad I did!

The liquid type can be very difficult to write on, but it's easy to apply. On the other hand, this correction tape is very easy to write on, but not so easy to apply. In principle the process should be very simple, but it doesn't always work out that way.

I don't think manufacturing defects like that are likely to be quite so common (knock on wood) as to cause much concern.  In terms of print quality, this toner is not bad (in fact pretty good)--but less than superlative description applies only because the OEM is really good.  I would say that the print quality (of photos) using the OEM is absolutely stunning--better than anything you'd expect from a $100-$200 printer or even something twice as expensive.  Print quality using the remanufactured toner, on the other hand, is something you'd figure you'd normally get from a reasonably priced color laser (I still think it's plenty good for a printer at this price).

I'm an Art student who uses markers for sketching. I have tried many brands and kinds of paper (Canson, Bee, Strathmore, Bienfang, tracing vellum, plastic vellum, etc). One day I saw this paper at the color laser printer on campus and decided to grab one sheet to give it a try. Man, was I impressed! I ordered a pack of these and have no regrets.

The reason why I was impressed was because the paper does not suck all the ink from my markers as others do (each COPIC marker is about 6 to 8 usd). I use cool grays most of the time, going from the C0, to C7 to lay down the main shapes or silhouettes (colorless blenders won't work well on it), then I use a brush pen with black India ink on top of the marker. The sheet takes the India ink so well and does not spread all over nor does it bleed. I also use very thin felt tip pens, and the surface is so smooth that the tips won't get damaged. I used to go through a bunch of these pens a month (Le Pen, Sakura, Copic fine liners) but now they last me a lot longer. Sometimes I have to use an extra sheet in the back because I put too much ink on and it will go through, but it's very few spots and only after several layers of marker, even with a Sharpie.
I have given some sheets to my classmates who use the same techniques and they have told me: ""WOW! this is so smooth and so much better than what I was using!"" So I'm not the only one pleased with it. Graphite or wax color pencils (such as Prismacolor Premiere or Col-Erase) won't work well on it, though; but I don't care since I use other surfaces for that.

My only problem now is all the cuts on my hands; it's really easy to get them with this paper because of its firmness and very well cut edges.

Bottom line: I haven't yet used it for color printing or laser, I may update the review later on... but it has very good qualities: it absorbs the ink just perfectly and in the right amount. Good weight, whiteness, etc. I recommend it for its value and the seller I got it from shipped it very quickly. I'm sure I'll buy more in the future.",53,8.370062

I needed both jumbo paper clips and a new money clip.

Thanks to all the reviewers before me for their reviews as I had forgotten all about premium paper clips.  If I had a written review it would have been along the same lines as the others.  Great clip, hefty, does the job well.  After reading so many bad money clip reviews I decided to hold off getting another money clip until after these Smooth Premium ACCO Jumbo Paper Clips  arrived and I am glad I did.

This is just a quick video review showing the difference between standard and premium.  Sorry in advance that I don't have jumbo standards to show you, but I'm not crazy enough to go out and buy some just to make a video.  I realize now I should have also shown you a bit more of how well these hold, but I think showing a single clip with twelve bills folded in half that it held without bending out of shape illustrates what I am talking about.

SIMPLE MATH: (wink, wink)
A good money clip cost $8 and up.  I wouldn't say these are great money clips but they definitely will do for going through the airport in the future, and I don't worry about them bending either.  So round it out to $10 money clip savings, that would make the your cost of 999 Jumbo paper clips $3.24 as one would be your $10 money clip.  Or I prefer having stock in money clips so $10 x 1,000= $10,000 for selling money clips minus cost of goods sold $13.24 equals $9,986.76 profit...

Of course I'm joking on all my calculations and all.

Seriously though, I have seen quite a few money clips that don't hold up as well as these paper clips.

The pencils themselves are a great choice to add to your collection or to purchase as your only set, however, the down side to these pencils is as follows:  The lead breaks constantly, some colors more than others, I can't tell you how frustrating it is to spend close to $100.00 for this set and have this issue.  I even use the sharpener that is designed for these pencils and there is no difference.  Would I buy them again?  Absolutely not, I think I would look into the Caran D'ache Pencil Sets, they don't break, they cost more, however, the quailty of the pigment is there along with no breakage in the lead which saves you $$$$.  It's sad that they don't redesign their pencils with the hexigon shape which would correct this flaw, along with give you more pigment for your money, only then would I truly consider purchasing another set, I truly feel as though I wasted my money on poor quality pigment that constantly breaks or who knows maybe they shipped me seconds...",13,8.446849

553,"Cons: I will say that the labeling process still sucks, and the labels don't slide far enough into the plastic tabs. I centered my tabs, and now it turns out that the text for some tabs is blocked by the tab before it.

Pros: The D ring is always my favorite, so that's a given, but I haven't had a binder yet that had such a good, overlapping clasp to keep it from pulling apart when you move a couple of hundred pages from one side of the ring to the other. I also like the lever to easily open the rings (though I do wish I could use it to close them, too). The extra pockets inside the front and back covers proved useful as soon as I started organizing, and I even used the pockets on the tabbed dividers more than I expected to, so I'm glad I went with this instead of a binder with regular, pocketless dividers.

556,"This is my first projector and I highly recommend it. I bought it to do PowerPoint presentations in training sessions for small groups of ten to twenty. The projector is easy to set up with my Toshiba Tecra laptop (I'd never done this before but it was easy to figure out). The only complaint I would have is that the cord is a bit short; many of the rooms in which I used this had a conference room table in the center and an extension cord was needed for the closest socket more than six feet away. Not a big deal, but a minor inconvenience.

The projector does run hot even after a 30 minute presentation, but I could pick it up soon after turning it off and pack it with no concerns. The image is bright enough in a small room even with some lights on (but not right over the screen, of course). The remote was pretty much useless for PowerPoint; I could not get it to advance slides, so I had to use the laptop. Maybe there's a way, but I couldn't find it. Also, there is no focus on the remote, but once you get the initial focus set, you really shouldn't need to change it for the same presentation, unless you have to move your projector. In fact, I don't use the remote for anything now so I don't bring it with me. The carrying bag is sturdy and the projector fits in tightly, which keeps it stable during transport.

I considered other projectors, especially those where the image can be straightened when you have to project at an angle (I don't know the technical term for this). I wish this had that feature for top/bottom and side corrections, especially with that short cord when we could not find an extension or projector table. Still, I'm happy with this purchase and it meets my needs once it is all set up.",7,7.0895624

560,"Let me preface this by saying that I probably have filled a small dumpster with the HPs I have used at home and in my small office.  This Brother printer, in fact, replaced hopefully the last HP I will ever have to mess with.  The Brother is still running on the ""sample"" ink cartridges that came with the machine....impressive.  I like that the ink levels are apparent in the little display screen and I don't have to scramble around trying to find the ink levels within programming. Using standard, decent but not stupidly expensive paper, we have had no jams or feed issues.  Probably not overfilling the paper tray helps in this regard. Print quality is fine and the print rate is typical for this price point machine. It runs fairly quietly (note my quiet scale is a bit warped by the early pin printers that literally drowned out all ambient sounds in a room).
I set this printer up for 4 laptops, 3 IPads and 2 IPhones with little or no difficulty.  The laptops were running XP, Vista Home Premium and Win8, and each required a little tweaking that should not present much of a problem unless this is your first rodeo.  In which case have a friend who has done this before help.  In all fairness, the Apple products set themselves up once they ""found"" the printer.  Air printing is flawless from all the devices. We'll see how long the happiness continues, but for now I guess I've drunk the Brother Koolaid.",7,6.7731314
561,"With the new, lower price on the Sony SJ30, there is now no reason to buy Palm-branded color models unless you prefer their form factor or want wireless capability.
The CLIE SJ30 provides everything you want in a Palm --
1) High resolution, brilliant color screen has 4 times the pixels of similarly-priced Palm models.
2) Long-lasting lithium battery.
3) A robust 16MB of memory, plenty to run all the Palm programs you could care for including the three I consider essential: Mapopolis (a mapping program from Mapopopolis.com with keyword-searchable street maps), Avantgo (an online news service that downloads articles to your palm) and Vindigo (a restaurant, movie and city guide).
The CLIE models, which start at just over a hundred clams, have a nice form factor, though not quite as elegant as the Palms, and upper-level models feature the best high-res color screens for less than what you'd pay for a similar PALM-branded model. But I've heard Sony's customer service is weak compared to Palm's easy-as-pie returns. These things do break from time to time, so keep that in mind.
Here's a basic PALM product guide:
Zire/Palm m100: Bottom of the line. Designed to suck you in but leave you wanting more. Think of this as the Chevy Chevette of Palms. Plagued by small screens.
Palm m105: The 8MB version of the m100. Fine, except needs batteries and plagued by small screen.
Palm 125: Ooh, expansion slot that you will probably never use. Still plagued by small screen.
Palm 130: Adds color, lithium battery to m125. Not bad, but screen still small, low res.
Palm m500: Still the standard for monochrome Palms. Lightweight, with a clear, large screen and a classic form-factor that gave the company its name. 8MB, expandable, lithium-polymer battery. Triple-Aces.
Palm m505: Discontinued color model features horrible washed out color screen. AVOID.
Palm m515: Soon to be discontinued Color PALM. Very good, but no Palm TUNGSTEN T. Expensive.
Palm TUNGSTEN T: The top of the line. Finally, Palm builds a PALM that can compete with a Pocket PC. Too bad they priced it like one too. Triple Aces design, with fabulous ergonomics, fantastic high-res active screen, battery, bluetooth, and drop-down graffiti pad. BUT, model due out next year will have phone function too.
Also check out the new Handspring Treo models, which feature thumbpads and a small form factor (some with phones).",59,14.596323

Canon support tells me that the drivers are being developed but don't know when they will be released.

574,"I'm going to give you an actual REVIEW of this product, rather that just say ""It's Good"", which is terrible if you're actually trying to buy something for the first time. Yes, this is a pad of paper, but it's an expensive pad of paper (for a reason).

First off, there is something different about this Ice pad when compared to the standard black/orange grid pad of the same size. I think they have the same specifications, but there's something definitely different in the paper, and I'm sad to say that I don't really enjoy it as much as I was hoping. I've included a photo, but it's hard capture the subtle differences. Here's a breakdown of my impression:

Color

The most obvious difference is that the grid lines are grey on this paper, instead of the ugly purple that somebody at Rhodia should have been fired over. This was the entire reason I bought this pad, because I just didn't like how weird and technical looking the purple grid was. I had somebody ask me if I was using some kind of architect pad or something for taking notes. Anyway, I don't actually like the grey lines on the Ice pad, either. They might be a little lighter than the purple, but they have a weird tone to them, almost olive-grey. My first thought when opening the box was ""Oh, I don't think I like this"". That's usually a bad sign for me personally. But, alas, I gave it a chance.

This paper is also a slightly different color than the standard Rhodia grid pad. It's very subtle, but it's definitely whiter, and appears to be a bit more opaque. Comparing the two, the standard grid almost appears to have a slightly pinkish tone to the white (if you have one you know what I'm talking about), and the Ice pad is almost eggshell white.

Feeling

You aren't going to believe me, but the Ice pad feels different and my inks behave differently on it. I don't particularly care for it. Note that it's a very subtle difference, but enough for me to immediately notice (and I'm just a regular guy, not a paper guru). My standard grid pad is smooth as glass, and is my favorite writing paper outside of Tomoe River. This Ice pad...does not have that exact same feel. All of my pens write in slightly finer lines, and they don't seem to write as wet on the Ice pad as they do on the standard grid. I tried Noodlers, Montblanc, and Pilot inks, all with the same exact results. The paper feels smooth, like my other pad, but it definitely behaves a bit different, almost like the nicer office copy paper that we have around my work. Not bad, but not what I was expecting.

My first standard grid Rhodia pad was a great experience. I filled the entire thing up very quickly. This pad has taken some getting used to, but it's still good paper. I would probably recommend the standard grid over this pad any day, but if you absolutely hate the purple grid and weird slightly pinkish paper, then this is a good alternative. I'll most likely switch back to the standard grid.

I feel like they were right on the money with the idea behind this pad, but something about it is different enough to change the overall writing experience.",6,12.418674
575,"I was looking for a calligraphy pen I could use for everyday writing, as opposed to the large versions I employ for commercial purposes.  This pen is sleek and compact - and it writes beautifully.  It's a little small, compared to a standard Mont Blanc-sized pen, you if you prefer something massive, this may not be for you.

Note:  This vendor ships from Japan - so mine took weeks to arrive. If you're in a hurry, this might be a concern.  I was well worth the wait for me.",21,5.9232373

577,"I product a double-sided newsletter on legal-size paper for a local charity organization. I print about 500 copies per month. This was the first issue I've printed on my new printer and I am so angry I want to scream. As my print job began, it froze up and told me I needed a new toner. That's OK, the standard one wasn't expected to last, and I have two high-capacity ones ready. Switched it out ... The print job wasn't even over before I got another low toner warning and it froze up again. Yes ... this so-called ""high capacity"" cartridge that is rated for 4000 standard copies quit working at less than 1000 pages of legal. I get that the paper is three inches longer but yeah ... three inches is 30%, not 400%, of letter size paper. I know there's toner left in there, but here's the f*******d up part, it doesn't let me reset the error and keep using the cartridge .... it jams the whole machine and won't move so I have to put ANOTHER one in there and let its little built it toner theft device start counting wrong again, and throw the other one away with what is probably 1000's of copies worth of toner left in it. SMASH THE TONER CARTEL, do yourself a favor and get something used that you can keep using toner refills in because a newer device is not worth the cost of throwing money out the window to the tune of multiple cartridges per month so some ink crony in a smoke filled room doesn't have to figure out how to actually compete for toner sales fair and square.",3,7.9332147
578,"And yes, I am shouting it from the rooftops!

I used to buy the 0.5 mm lead pencils but purchased these because I wanted my homeschoolers to use them and didn't want them to constantly be breaking the lead.  The 0.9 mm works great!

Using these pencils has taught the kids to use a ""lighter touch"" when writing, so papers with holes in them have become a thing of the past.  Writing with a lighter touch also means a lot less ""erasure"" usage with less damage to the paper.  And the kids think they are so cool using them.  If they start to act up (or like little kids) the ultimate threat is to take away their grown-up pencil.

Even better is that I've begun using them too.  I even use them for a little drawing.",8,5.630246

One thing, aside from actually using it, that told me Bostitch believes in the Impulse is the amazing warranty.  I've never seen a warranty in any office product that is a 7-year one.  The Impulse is very well-designed and has some very useful features that I really like.  Operation is actually quite intuitive and it's basically a plug-and-operate stapler.

As soon as I plugged it in I noticed a blue LED indicator on the top signaling the fact that there were no staples on board.  I hit the magazine release button toward the back of the Impulse and the magazine extension popped out.  I pulled it open and loaded the magazine with standard staples.  Similar to the old-fashioned staples, I simply had to drop them in.  Once the stapler is loaded with staples, the LED indicator shuts off.  This is a great feature to have if you have a lot of work to do.

This is an excellent school or office stapler, but isn't one that's meant to be used continually all day.  It will staple up to 25 sheets and does it quite nicely.  It's not recommended for cardboard, but nicely works with chipboard.  This is a good to know feature for crafters and people who scrapbook.  What's extra cool is that if you have a lot of stapling to do on one day, you can store up to four extra racks in the magazine itself.  No having to rush to get more in the supply cabinet.

The Bostitch Impulse is an ultra-fast stapler.  If you need to get the job done fast and efficiently, this is certainly one stapler to consider.  I definitely liked the ease of use and that warranty.  Extra onboard features include ""No-Jam technology,"" which is self-explanatory, and an ""Exclusive Impulse Drive design for 3x faster stapling speed.""  This hands-free efficient stapler is an excellent one for school or business use.

FEATURES:

  Exclusive Impulse Drive design for 3X faster* stapling speed
  Staples 2 to 25 sheets
  No-Jam technology eliminates frustrating staple jams
  Refill alert light indicates when to reload staples
  Fast Load push-button staple refill system

I was very patient, non confrontational, and really just wanted to get it to work. The bottom line is the home number was not showing up on their key pad. At one point I could make calls but couldn't receive them because they went to a voicemail that didn't exist and I certainly couldn't access. But that lasted 2 hours and then no incoming or outgoing calls. I was told to wait a week for the review to conclude. I ""typed"" back 1.5 weeks later (thank God we had a cell phone) and the first guy told me it's still under review and when I reminded him of the Magic Jack settlement where they are supposed to address issues within 24-48 hours, he disconnected me. I called back and reverted to my initial calm approach and spent 3 hours typing back and forth only to have the 4th rep I spoke to tell me that it's still under review. HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO REVIEW? So in summary, the magic jacks have been returned. I've lost my home number that I've had for over 45 years, there's not a customer service phone number to reach these jokers, CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NON-EXISTENT WITH THESE PEOPLE and I'm contemplating calling the BBB.

584,"I like that this stand is taller than many other stands. It boosts my iMac by a full 4 inches, which is higher than some adjustable stands. It's the perfect height for my eyes. For Mac owners, the aluminum finish fits right in. It's rather heavy, so I'm comfortable it can handle the weight of the 27-inch computer. The USB ports on the front are handy.
Why not 5 stars?
Because, as others have noted, they're selling you an allegedly powered USB hub without any power adapter.
There is a power adapter outlet on the inside the USB hub but no power supply is provided. I contacted Satechi to ask how to buy a power supply to make it a powered hub and they replied, promptly, that they don't sell one.
So strange to sell an incomplete product and then not offer a way to make it work as designed. Naturally, USB ports can work un-powered, but only as long as the device you're plugging in doesn't need that extra boost.",8,6.448511

587,"I homeschool my son, so it seems like I am constantly on search for the best pencils, pencil sharpeners and erasers. I am happy to report I have found the erasers to meet our needs! My son hates the cheap eraser caps you get at the dollar store. The cheapies sometimes scratch the paper, don't erase fully, and are crazy colors. I also found I was gluing the cheap caps to the pencils because they would fall off during use, and sometimes had to cut them down from the super pointy tip they come with.

These beauties arrived and we popped them on our pencils, and immediately my son announced they were awesome. They don't have a pointy edge, stay on the pencil, are a velvety texture, and erase so well. They are like a genuine pink pearl eraser, just in cap form. I initially thought I would share with friends since so many came in the box, but I think I will just horde them instead for myself :)

They are a great compliment to our new favorite pencils- which are also made by Papermate- the black mirados. FANTASTIC pencils- no breakage, sharpen nice and have a great smooth point.

When it goes to sleep sometimes it doesn't reconnect to the wireless and renders the wireless printing portion of the printer useless. To fix it I did all of the following steps and I don't know if order matters or what actually fixed it.

- Restarted both computer and printer (numerous times)
- Uninstalled and reinstalled all the software that came with the printer
- Disabled Wireless LAN DRX and IPv6 networking in the printer network settings
- Added a network location via the web gui (accessed by typing the ip of the printer into your web browser
- updated the firmware of the printer via the device settings on the printer
- Re-configured the wireless settings on the printer using the manual configuration including re-entering the wireless password

The Freedom Planner is smart looking, hard cover with the Freedom Planner logo embossed on the front.  The planner is spiral bound  with durable double wire binding.  There is an elastic band to keep the planner closed and a ribbon for quick access to mark your place.

On the first page is a spot for the owners name and contact information.  Then there are four pages of introduction, telling you how to use the planner most effectively.  There is a facing page 2016 and 2017 calendar.  Next is a place for your personal and professional goals. There is also space to write out why the goals are important and how you will feel once you achieve them.  Then there is a space to prioritize your goals for the year.

After this section, the rest of the planner is by month.  For each month, there are Tasks and Actions to be accomplished by month.  Each day is listed with half hour slots (7 AM to 9 PM) for weekdays and 14 lines for Saturday and Sunday.  There are also questions for each day, Today Did I 1) Keep my word 2) Learn something new 3) Do something outside my comfort zone and 4) Pay it forward with a random act of kindness.
In the lower right hand corner of each right hand page is an inspirational or motivational quote.

At the end of each month is a Reflecting Back section, asking questions and providing space for answering how you spent your time, what you can improve on, etc.

This is a very good day planner with the added benefit of having space to write out and prioritize your goals.  The questions are very powerful.  But they will only work if the user takes the time to write out the answers and make adjustments based on them.

Regardless of whether an outage lasts an hour or days, when the electricity goes out, out nifty, convenience packed, cordless, electronic phones do not function. Cell phones never work, regardless of the weather, because of our mountainous location.

When the electricity goes off, we go old school and pull this corded phone out of the junk drawer. Using it means being tethered to the wall with a very limited range of mobility. At any other time it would be a hassle to use, but is like a gift from above during the times when it is the only option for communicating with the outside world.

The twisty cord gets easily knotted up and the base is made too light. Unless hung from the wall, expect the base to skitter all about the counter top when the cord is pulled on even slightly. That all said, when this thing has to be put in use, function is way more important than form.

I spent hours on the phone with my phone company and Panasonic. Everyone was clueless why it wasn't working. I decided to unplug line 2 from the back of the Panasonic. After I did that, caller ID started working. As soon as I plugged the cord back into line 2, caller ID stopped working again. Called Panasonic and was told phone must be defective. I am returning the phone system but am curious if anyone else is experiencing this problem before I even consider buying another.

In addition, my phone handset had a slight buzzing noise in the background during conversations, something none of my other cordless phone had. Perhaps Panasonic quality is declining?

Pros:
2 line
Selectable ringers
USB charging port on side
Nice, loud speakerphone on base
Transferred large phone book from my Android without issue
Link to cell feature

Cons:
Slight buzzing sound during calls
Headset volume could be louder
'Tinny' sounding handset speaker - callers sound a bit muffled
Bluetooth connection to cell sometimes drops connection

This is a very expensive phone system and should not have the issues I've pointed out here.

Update June 13:

Ordered a replacement phone and the caller ID now works as it should. However, there is still a slight buzzing sound coming from the handsets during conversations. The volume is still on the low side and callers sound a bit muffled and tinny. Playing around with the equalizer and calls actually sound worse. The noise reduction helps a bit but not enough IMHO. Again, for this price range, caller volume should be louder and handset sound should be fuller. This sounds more like a cheap phone system and I cannot fully recommend.",23,12.94095
620,"This review is split into three sections:  Scanner, software, and combined effort

Scanner:  As a scanner, the NeatDesk desktop scanner is pretty good. As others have stated, the lack of a good paper guide makes for receipt imaging that is often askew.  Yes, there are other scanners on the market that avoid this, for the most part, but for me, the imaging askew isn't that big of a deal. The scanner is of average quality, and it does precisely what any scanner should do.... takes in your paper item and creates a digital image of same.  The size is really great (fits easily on a desk) and it's very easy to use.  Set up is essentially plug and play.  This is a no fuss scanner.  It's the best thing about the product, overall.

WIth scan quality of 600 dpi (and frankly, that's overkill for what this scanner can be used for...) and the ability to scan up to 15 items at a time, along with a 48 ppm function speed, the scanner is really quite a powerful little tool that is appealing to the eye.

One drawback is that the scanner can't handle crumpled and dog eared documents all that well. It's best to use gently folded receipts and invoices.  You can easily jam the feeder with anything that's been in your wallet, purse, or pants pocket for too long.

Software:  This is where the train leaves the track.  The software just isn't user friendly, and I find the integration with the scanner to be a complete mess.  Whereas the scanner is plug and play and no fuss, the software requires a fairly extensive installation.  But the software has limitations.  Yes, you can mark receipts for specific purposes (tax account, reimbursable, etc.) but the software doesn't allow OCR and you can't set up functions to scan directly to email, etc.  In other words, the software is nothing more than an ""organizer"" that doesn't allow the user to really do much else.

Combined Effort:  I think we're now beyond this.  I'm all for an organizing software, but such is a dime a dozen and for free across the vast internet.  While the scanner is good quality, it's scan limitations with the software mean that it's a limiting device.  You'd be better served, in may respects, with an all in one product that allows you to scan and perform an immediate function (mark the document, send the document by email or fax, etc).  Additionally, while scan technology is likely here to stay for awhile, you can't ignore the advances in mobile technology that allow you do things like deposit checks by photo, for example. There's already a free system on the net (with app for your computer and phone) that can handle the same functions as the NeatDesk, and the entire system is free.

Finally, I propose this..... what is your purpose of scanning documents.  Do you want to get rid of the original?  If so, this system makes some sense, but keep in mind that there are times when the original receipt, for example, is necessary... so you can't really just throw it all away.  Also, high scan quality eats memory like a shark eats chum, so be mindful of storage capacity, because the Neat software doesn't care.

I think it's overprice, and outmoded already, and not worth the investment.  The two stars comes from the quality of the scanner and it's ease of use, and from the fact that if your sole desire is to scan a box of receipts and invoices into digital storage so you can clear out an area of your home, then have at it.  You're paying a lot to do that with this system, but it will accomplish your goal.  If you desire to further manipulate your documents.... look elsewhere.",12,13.511747

623,"I have thousands upon thousands of 35mm slides which I promise myself that I will sort, edit and scan. Some day.

 While I would not recommend the Wolverine F2D for projects as massive as the one I should undertake, it is an excellent device for the person who has fairly modest quantities of images to convert from film to digital.

 The unit itself is a surprisingly small box-like thing measuring roughly 4 x 4 x 3 inches. It can be powered from a computers USB port or the included AC adapter. The unit has internal memory that will accommodate approximately 40 images. Or you can use SD cards of up to 32GB capacity.

 Setup is dirt-simple: plug in the power, read the short instructions, pick the film adapter you want to use and go. Adapters are included for 35mm mounted slides and negative film, 110, 126, Kodak Pocket and Super 8 film.

 I used only the 35mm slide adapter for my testing. I chose some winter time slides of a sledding hill in bright sunlight, with people wearing brightly colored winter clothing. In other words, I was asking for trouble.

 For 35mm slides, you stick the appropriate adapter into a slot and slide the slide in and center it in the 2.4 inch screen. Click the Convert button. Wait ten seconds or so for it to stop processing, perform any of the editing steps as described below, save the digital scan and slide in another slide. For moderately sized batches, it is a surprisingly quick process.

 You have limited editing options available. You can mirror or flip the image, alter the EV value to make the image brighter or darker and alter the RGB values.

 The resulting images are 5,472 x 3,648 pixels with 24 BPP. Best of all, the quality was very high. I was very surprised, in fact. I shot the originals with a Nikon with pretty good exposure control  and the Wolverine faithfully scanned the slide. The resulting scan is quite usable.

 I have highly specialized, quite expensive software for scanning slides and images on higher-end scanners, but the Wolverine F2D would do nicely for people who aren't fanatically demanding. Ive had units similar to the Wolverine in the past which were very disappointing. But the Wolverine F2D is surprisingly good and I wouldnt hesitate to recommend it to someone who had moderate numbers of slides to scan. I see no reason why it wouldnt turn in equally good results on the other sizes it is capable of handling.

626,"I was looking for proper file folders to replace my ghetto version made from an old cardboard box and I searched through many listings, frustrated with the (ridiculous) high prices. Then I saw this listing and its mixed reviews and decided to give it a try.

I purchased it to store hanging files and manila folders and I wanted something with a lid and something that would look semi-professional.

The boxes were packaged well and really don't take up much space when you break them down, which is great! I read that some folks had trouble getting the snaps to close, but I did not have that problem. I ordered 3 and they all were assembled really easily. I love the metallic handles on the boxes! I am secretly annoyed with the hole-handles many file-boxes come with. These metallic handles make it really easy to carry them. I also like having a lid so I don't have to see files and folders staring at me all the time.

The tops of the box where the snaps close do not align tightly. So what? Well...If you're using hanging folders, then the hanging part will get caught at each of the 4 corners whenever you try to move your files back and forth.

The box has a label thing which is really nice, actually. It's really, really hard to get the label card/paper out. I gave up and just wrote directly on it. It might be easier using a tweezer or something to remove that.

The Lid.
The lid serves a decorative purpose only, which I find frustrating. The point of having a lid is to be able to close something securely. This lid does no such thing. It is purely decorative as it is very loose and wobbly. If you're looking for stackable boxes - this item is not for you.

628,"Have used Macs for 35 years and have also owned other Rain Design products.  The mBase is of high quality and matches the look of the iMac well in terms of metal material.  The mBase does add a more clunky look to iMac base, its not an entirely natural look when compared to the sleek look of the minimalistic iMac base.  The drawer is ok, but not all that useful.  The main virtual of the Rain Design mBase is ergonomics and your overall health.  By raising the iMac 2"" higher it forces your head to be in a more upright position which can take literally tens of pounds of pressure off of your neck.  I read somewhere that a 30% angle is like having a german shepherd on your head weight wise.  From a health perspective, the mBase is a real winner.  And it looks about as good as one can expect from a 3rd party base, just doesn't look quite as good as the iMac in its natural sleek minimalist state.  If you suffer from computer related neck pain (or are concerned you will one day), certainly try the mBase out.  Beyond ergonomics, I can see no real use for the mBase.",2,9.49164

632,"Recently, I replaced the hinges on our interior doors because we were changing the color of the hardware to antique bronze.  Everything went fine except for one door that just wouldn't stay open after replacing the hinges.  I tried everything else I could think of - but I suspect the builders had done something to the original hinges to compensate for a door that wasn't hung completely straight.

Anway, after discovering these hinges on Amazon, I went ahead and bought 2 of them - one for the problem door and another for an exterior door that we like to prop open occasionally.

The install was easy and the doors now stay open exactly as we had wanted.  Honestly, in my opinion, there isn't anything bad to say about the function of these - the only issue is the length.  The actual door stop is the same size as a normal door stop, but the door attachment adds an inch extra.  That extra inch isn't even noticeable on the interior door since the door stop hits almost on the end of the door, but it makes the exterior door seem like it won't open all the way since the door stop hits further toward the hinge  (I hope that makes sense).  What I ended up doing was to move the door stop off of the moulding and onto the wall to cut off some of the size - which works great, but doesn't seem like it should have been necessary.

Overall, I highly recommend these.  Just keep the extra size in mind when ordering.  As a reference, the door stop protrudes 3"" and the attachment for the door is 1"" deep.",18,7.9851766
633,"TL;DR: For the price, Linkyo's toner cartridges offer good print quality and output. A great economical choice for students, medical professionals in private practice, and anyone else with a lot of stuff to print. Recommended.

I bought a pair of these toner cartridges in Juneof 2016. My spouse, a physical therapist in private practice, generates oceans of paperwork, all printed at home on our multifunction laser printer (Canon MF4800). I wish I'd keep track of how many pages we're getting out of a given cartridge, but I can say that it's a lot.

Print quality is comparable to that of name-brand cartridges: crisp and readable text; good contrast between inky black and various shades of grey.

As the first cartridge approached the end of its life, the overall contrast of printed pages declined evenly, without streaks, which was a nice surprise.

I've also printed out a bunch of black and white photos, and I'm pretty happy with the results.

Installation was painless and straightforwardthe familiar ""pull out these tabs and drop in the cartridge"" routine. Fit in the printer is precise and easy.

We will be ordering these cartridges againthey further enhance the convenience and economy of our laser printer.",3,8.508368

638,"I was actually surprised at these pencils.  After using Prismacolor, Ive kinda become spoiled.  These are sorta similar, they do have soft lead.  The only difference is that every once in a while, you will run into times when there is a hard tiny piece of lead that creates a hard line when you are trying to color softly.

The pencils come in a large tin and mine was dented in upon arrival.  I was able to partially bend it back into place and there isn't an issue opening and closing the tin - it just looks bad in that place.  Also, it's a pain to try to remove the top tray of pencils, the plastic isn't very sturdy so it sags when  you pick it up.  The places where you pick it up are hard to grasp.  Also you can't just close the lid after you take the top tray and place it in the lid, you have to put it back into it's place then close the lid (or else the pencils will spill everywhere).  There is a fair variety of colors, some are super close in color to others to where you can't really tell the difference in the two shades.  It is also hard to remove each individual color without breaking the lead unless the color beside it has already been taken out.

These will definitely work for me but if you're a professional, go ahead and get the expensive ones.

639,"I got my hands on this unit for $10 during the post-Thanksgiving melee last year.  For that price it's stellar.  However, I have to agree with some of the other reviewers regarding its shortcomings:

1) The method of removing the backing is ineffective, taking multiple attempts and often ruining the label.

2) There is far too much waste on the ends of the labels.  If your text is short, you wind up cutting more of the label away than you use for the text itself.  For example, I was labeling the switches for a power center, and needed the small text to read ""HUB"".  It spit out almost 2 inches of tape for a label that was less than 3/8"" long when finished.  There should be some way to adjust that.

643,"It prints ok, but not great. Seems really flimsy, cheap. Not sure how long it will last. I have to send it back because when it runs out of paper, it never recognizes that you have put more paper in it. Just sets there looking stupid with ""out of paper"" light flashing. I spent 2 hours with HP tech support asking me stupid questions such as are you using HP paper, and HP ink, like that would affect the fact that it doesn't know there is paper in it.

You have to keep an eye on it when it is printing many sheets of paper because it doesn't have a separate output tray. The paper just lays on two plastic side pieces 1/4 inch above the input paper tray. I imagine they can end up getting fed in again if you walk away from it. All the buttons and lights are on top of the printer so you can't see them if you have it setting on your desk. That placement is great if you are standing up to use it. The ink cartridges only hold 5 ml of ink each not the 19ml I am use to. It does seem prone to paper jams. Get a pair of forceps to help you get the shredded paper out. There is not much room to get anything else in there. The left side paper guide keeps working it's way away from the paper stack. So far it hasn't cause any paper skewing.

644,"After several years of use, my MFC-6490CW Brother AIO started giving me poor quality printouts, and nothing I tried would fix it. So I opted for a new one. This MFCJ6920DW is perfect, even better so far than the MFC-6490. I loved my old Brother AIO, but this one has all the features I wished the old one had. Evidently the folks at Brother listened to the customer feedback. This one has duplex scanning and printing, smarter paper selection, more custom settings, better document feeding, faster communication with the pc, smarter scan capabilities, and many more. I was a bit shocked to see that it has top and bottom side scanning. I guess the extra hardware was not cost-prohibitive.

  Software installation was a cumbersome process, taking almost an hour to install the full ""suite"" of programs. On my secondary pc, all I needed was a simple priinter driver, but even that took 15 minutes and crashed near the end. Fortunately it succeeded anyway.

  The ink cartridges are inexpensive ones that do not include the printheads. That is a good thing in the short term, because of the lower costs. In the long run, it may be a liability, because you cannot easily replace the printhead if it wears out or becomes hopelessly clogged. On my old MFC6490, I think that is the case and so it is now mostly useless except as a big scanner.

  The document feeder works faster and better than my old one. I saw a drop in scan time of over 50% while doing a multi-page pdf scan (on both sides at that). That made me very happy. No more combining of alternate pages after the scan.

  The fax machine part was a simple setup and worked perfectly with my existing answering machine/phone.

  Delivery was fast and the box was in perfect condition.

 As with the older unit, I will add to this review over the months and years with my experiences.

****Followup #1 on 12/24/2013: Not much to report so far. Works as well as I expected. The one thing I do not like is the noisy paper feed which has a very loud thud when a single sheet is fed. Nothing wrong with the printout but I can't help but wonder if something is wrong somewhere inside.

p.s. For those of you disappointed in the color prints (as am I), try photo paper before giving up. I was shocked at how much better they look than on plain paper. Don't forget to select photo paper in the setup.

****Followup #2 on 3/15/2014: As before, nothing to report except that this unit is still working fine. I have not yet updated the firmware and it is several versions behind. ""If it aint broke..."". After 4 months of use, I just now replaced the original black cart. The other 3 are still original, and this unit is used daily.

****Followup #3 on 2/5/2015: Still going strong. I had a bit of a scare a couple weeks ago when the printout was missing lines within each scan of the print-head. I had run out of Brother carts and had installed a no-name one a week before. I immediately removed the no-name cart and replaced it with genuine Brother one. Then I did a intermediate print-head cleaning. It was back to normal operation then. I don't really know if the non-Brother cart had created the problem or not, but from now on I am taking no chances. As a reference, I just found new $37 print-heads available from A**E****** (china)for the MFC-6490 and, since I still have it, I ordered one. I will see if that fixes it. They used to cost about $200 and was what prompted me to buy the new one.

****Followup #4 on 11/16/2015:  Big problem. The print-head started missing a lot of lines on the black ink, so I changed the cartridge. There was no improvement, so I made many attempts to run the head cleaning steps. That made things worse and then it started missing lines on all colors big time. Some were missing almost all the dots in the test print pattern. After days of trying to fix this, I was tempted to simply give up and buy a new printer once again! But since I now am retired and don't use it for my business, I gave it another try. I ordered this cleaning kit from Amazon/Printhead Hospital: http://www.amazon.com/Print-Head-Cleaner-Brother-Printers/dp/B0089OIZL0/
It took many, many repetitions of the procedure before the test print was almost perfect (only one dot missing). At that point I said ""close enough"" and stopped. That was two months ago and it is still printing fine.

****Followup #5 on 5/4/2016: Still going strong with perfect print-head operation.",78,12.319335

652,"First of all, I am not sour grapes.  I had a really bad experience setting up my Ooma, but I take full responsibility for it.  Hopefully by sharing my story I can help other users avoid the mistake that I made.

Before I go into my experience though, I should say a few words about the product and service.

I LOVE MY OOMA SERVICE!!!

I was so sick of my overpriced phone service.  And worse than that, I was sick of all the annoying calls.  Although I was first tempted by the low cost of the Ooma service, the thing that sold me was the ability to block unwanted calls.

There are two levels of call blocking:  The Community blacklist is a list of blocked numbers maintained by Ooma.  Presumably they analyze the numbers blocked by individual customers and determine whether they are truly nuisance numbers (telemarketers, robocalls, etc.).  The second level is the Personal blacklist.  If I get a call from a number I want to block, I just go to my profile page on their website and add it to my blacklist.  I can add up to 255 numbers to my personal list.

Although I have no way of knowing how many calls are blocked because of Ooma's Community blacklist (because I never see them), I can look at my call log and see that many of the numbers I have added to my personal blacklist have been blocked multiple times since I added them.  That's great.  My whole motivation here is to stop paying a fortune for a home land line that's only used by telemarketers to annoy me.

Setting up the service was simple (with a big caveat that I'll go into in a sec.).  Although I bought two additional Ooma handsets, this wasn't really necessary.  I also plugged my cordless phone base into the Ooma box and this makes the rest of my cordless phones ring when a call comes in.  I like the additional features from the Ooma handsets, but they aren't really required.

So what about the problems...?

Follow my train of thought here.  It seemed logical to me at the time, but I was W-R-O-N-G.

Previously I was paying AT&T a fortune for DSL and phone service.  I have no loyalty to them, so pulling the plug on AT&T became a secondary motivation to me.  They overcharged me for services for years, so if I could cut them completely out of the picture, so much the better.  I just needed to find providers for DSL and for phone.  I was already sold on Ooma, so that only left the ISP to figure out.

In my area we have a service that competes with AT&T called DSL Extreme.  Because of some antitrust agreement, AT&T is required to lease a certain number of lines to DSL Extreme, so I set up an account with them to be my new ISP.  They established that I had a functioning phone line to the house (check!) and that I lived within their service area (check!).

So with my new DSL service through DSL Extreme established, I connected my Ooma hardware and set up my account with Ooma.  Then I signed up for Ooma's Premium service and requested to have my home phone number ported over to Ooma (awesome!).

Porting the number took about three days.  No problem.

But as soon as my number was ported, AT&T disconnected my home phone service as I'd hoped they would.  That's where things went wrong though.  Disconnecting my home phone killed my 3rd party DSL service.  Oops.  No ISP, no Ooma.  The confusion was between me and the third party ISP.

Luckily one of the features of the Ooma service is that you can define a number for them to forward all of your calls in case your internet connection dies.  So all of my home calls were routed to my cell number and we didn't miss any calls.

It took me another week or so to get another ISP to come out and hook me up with internet service (fiber optic).  As soon as I had service, the Ooma came back to life and our phone service kicked back in.

We've been using it for about two months now and we LOVE it!!!!

The moral of the story is, don't get too cute when you re-route your phone service.  Make sure you have all your duckies in a row.  I thought I had it all figured out, but I was wrong.",4,10.700922

Both the scanner and copier are easy to use and a nice convenience.  I do like the all-in-one of this printer even though the printing function is what I use 90% of the time.

I have used the non-OEM ink cartridges with no noticeable difference in printing quality.  The ink cost would be the one complaint I have with this printer.  So using non-OEM cartridges helps with that problem.

656,"I honestly tried to give this printer a long time to try and really like it and I just could not.  I work from home and my husband has his own small business and occasionally works from home.  First off, it was not working wireless with Apple Macbook Pro as noted.  I did however get it to work wirelessly with my husband's desktop Dell with Windows 10 platform.  But when do you need a wireless printer?  With a laptop!  Anyway, the thing is heavy.  The box stated two man pick up and it was much bigger than I thought it would be.  Taken out of the box, it was compact but tall.  The benefit is the legal size print and quick scanner.  I seem to think this would work best in a small accountant or legal office where there is little need for color but a huge need for black and white legal-size documents.  The paper storage is massive with the one slot that can hold up to 500 pages.  But after that, I can not think where a $500 machine would benefit that a smaller less expensive one couldn't.  Not only does it not print in color, but it has a hard time working wirelessly with apple products, and it is limited in what it can for it's cost and size.  I do like the quickness of the color scanner though. I have a simple brother black/white monochrome printer that holds 200 pages and prints 30ppm that is $300 cheaper and much more compact.  Yes it doesn't have the fastest scanner and copier but I don't need it as much to make it worth the cost.

If it's scratched off now, imagine what it would look like after heavy use!  The text is a generic font that isn't printed very sharp as well.

To improve this item, they need to: 1) use a higher quality mold that doesn't make the metal look like cheap plastic, and 2) use ink that doesn't rub off, with better quality control, and 3) sharper image printing. Another option is they could remake this without any ink printing and have it as molded as solid pieces of metal, with metal-impressions of the house sigils; that could also look classy.

662,"Giving this four stars is dependent on its price.  The barrel is about the cheapest thing I have ever bought in a fountain pen - the cheaper Platinum Preppy seems better put together.  But ahhhhh that nib!  A smooth, fairly narrow stub (my guestimate is about .8 mm - definitely narrower than 1.0 mm) that gives some flair and expression to your writing.  It is not a plain round tip medium.  And honestly, I bought it with the intent of yanking the nib and feed and putting it into my much nicer Metropolitan.  But the full pen itself needs to be considered.  It's a flyweight - something to consider if you don't like light pens.  It has an ""ergonomic"" grip - kind of like the triangular Lamy Safari - also something to consider if you don't like triangular grips.  It does probably help in aligning the stub nib parallel to the writing surface, but I find it tiring.  There's one cartridge and no converter - so either get some extra cartridges or a converter.  It can be converted to an ""eyedropper"" pen and just fill the barrel of the pen with ink, but use silicon grease on the threads (which are the part that screams ""cheap"" the loudest), an o-ring if possible, and test it with water for leaks first.  The blue ink that came with my pen was actually rather nice.  And the nib is swappable with a number of other Pilot pens.  But if you just want to try a stub nib and not spend a lot of money on it, this might be a good first experiment.",2,7.2100935

Once that board was filled with papers though, we bought a second one to hang next to our first one, and I don't love this one as much as I loved the previous one--mostly because of the hanging mechanism on the back. On the older version, the hooks on the back were more versatile--little wire triangles that you could hang over nails on the wall, and they swiveled, which meant that they were more forgiving if your nails weren't perfectly placed. But this one just has fixed holes in the back for you to drop over screws in the wall, so you have to be very precise when you drill the screws into the wall. If you can handle that part though, then it's a nice looking board and a great price.",17,5.111666

#1 - works excellent on my Canon MX922 printer (best on high resolution setting vs. photo settings) with both Canon inks and generic inks.

#2 - does not print well with my HP Officejet Pro - ink smears and gets extremely streaky and blotchy.

#3 - #1 and #2 really bum me out as my HP Officejet Pro is so much cheaper to print on vs. the Canon (even with generic inks).

#4 - the paper has a very strong lingering smell. To me, it smells like chemicals, but I have had to refund several clients who claim that my products smell like cigarette smoke. I do not smoke. BUT this paper is the best and cheapest on the market. My current work around is literally to layer each page after printing with a dryer sheet and letting it sit for 24-hours. It's a pain and completely slows down production and shipping.

Fix the smell issues guys and I will be a customer for life!

Hope this helps someone!

672,This laminator is junk - I missed the return window by two days because everyone in my house is sick.  It seems like laminators don't last (this is probably my 5th over the last 10 years) and so I thought I would get a less expensive well-rated one.  I am not sure what is going on but the laminate heated unevenly (wasn't melted in some parts - curled in others) - got stuck or curled around roller...  It didn't manage id card laminate at all (Had to pull the cards from the rollers - they didn't come out on their own) - and had terrible issues with letter-sized laminate.  I am pretty unhappy with this laminator.  Amazon did arrange a return but now I don't know what to do - I am torn because the other reviews are so good but my experience was really bad.  I am not sure if I just managed to get a lemon.  I will update if I decide to try this particular laminator again.,2,4.088914

674,"I picked this up at a local office store because I needed a stapler, I didn't really put my thought into my selection, just figured swingline was a good brand.  I was really surprised at what a great design this was.  First, the stapler stands on end the way you see in the picture - I honestly can't figure out why all smaller staplers aren't built like this now!  Its much easier to tuck it somewhere.  I mostly use it by picking it up and squeezing it anyway, but of course it can be used by setting it the regular way and pushing down on it.  The ergonomics are nice - the bottom is a soft rubber and there is a depression on the bottom so when you hold it with your fingertips on the bottom its very comfortable.

Contrary to other reviewers, I have never had a jam, but then again I purchased the swingline anti-jam staples (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Swingline-Optima-Premium-Staples/dp/B001U8PRY0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Swingline Optima Premium Staples</a>), not the cheapest ones on the shelf.

681,"I'm big into papercrafting and planner organizing and the BIG thing lately has been printable stickers. After doing some research, we decided on this Wireless printer and have been THRILLED with the results.

Pros:
- Ridiculously easy to install. Like a lot of computers these days, my main laptop does not have a optical drive, so I had to use the web address provided in the set up booklet instead of the CD and it worked great. Easy to follow instructions and minor troubleshooting.
- Set up is quick. I was set up and printing within 15 minutes.
- I installed an app on my Android Smartphone and can print from there without an issue as well.
- GREAT for Papercrafting. I have a Cricut Explore Air, and this printer pairs perfectly. I print a variety of materials (printable fabric, sticker sheets, label sheets, printable vinyl, etc) and ALL have worked great. No smearing and great color quality no matter the material used.
- This is a ""wide format"" printer which means it can print up to 13x19 size paper (which again, is great for papercrafting in which lots of paper is 12x12 standard)
- The price! I can't believe a wide format, wireless, high quality printer was under $200. Amazing!

I refuse to pay a crazy amount of money for resume paper, when I can get a brand that looks professional and doesn't break the bank! Anyways, I had always bought this paper at one of two massive chain stores, but over the last couple months I found this paper on amazon and realized that the price was even better on here, plus so much more convenient to order online when I realize that I'm getting low, as I try to avoid going to those massive chain stores until the last possible moment!
Again, you can't go wrong with the quality of this paper. The thickness is perfect, and definitely is comparable to the more expensive brands of resume paper.

685,"This printer is quiet in operation. The prints are clean and sharp, if a bit lighter in density than I would choose. The setup was fairly easy. It does print from iPhone, iPad, and WiFi Macs. But I am rating it only four stars because I can find no way to make this printer wake-up from its Sleep or Deep Sleep modes from any of my devices. Pressing certain keys on the printer will move it from Deep Sleep to Sleep, but that's it. The purpose of a Sleep mode is to save energy, and if the printer cannot wake from Sleep, it might as well shut down completely! I have to restart this printer for almost every printed page. I have reset the time-to-sleep setting to 10 minutes, and this helps some, but Brother really should fix this bug in their firmware. AirPrint needs to be able to wake-up the printer from either Deep Sleep or Sleep, and if not from Deep Sleep, at least from Sleep!

Writing with a 1.5mm Goulet-branded stub nib by JoWo, it was immediately apparent to me why people adore this brand of ink. Coming from using mostly Noodler's and Chinese branded inks like Hero, Pilot Iroshizuku is a bit of a decadence for fountain pen enthusiasts. Is it expensive? Yes. Are the colors superior to other brands? Eh, sometimes. Not necessarily with this one. But this is a thinner ink, laying down almost like water and offering a really nice writing experience. I also tried it in a Jinhao X450 that I had imported from China for about a buck. It seemed vulgar using such a fine ink in such a common pen, but I like it. The packaging is really nice, too. I want to hide my Noodler's ink bottles away in a drawer. They look kind of... common. The Pilot Iroshizuku bottle looks sophisticated, like it contains one of the finer things in life (and it does). I'll leave one of these sitting on top of my desk, just so that's the ink bottle that people see. Just forget about the cost and buy this stuff already. You deserve it.",6,7.2048426

I need want to own anything else that is kelly green. OVER IT. If you go too dark with the green shaded inks, a lot of times they don't even look green, unless in bright lights.

Let me tell you that this green is unlike any other green ink I've ever written with. The shade is dark enough to be seen clearly regardless of the lighting, but also very toned down and mellow. I can see Prince Harry having a wall painted this color, or better yet, I got it... this looks like the green that Picasso painted with a lot. Springy, Leafy, Mating Season Green.

694,"I really loved this pen when I received it as a gift. Though heavy, it writes like a dream. And really nice design.

The catch is that although it is made of durable materials, after about 2.5 years, the decorative cap on the bottom just fell off (not dropped or traumatized) and the cap seal has already worn out--it now fits loosely and the nib dries out. Parker is willing to repair it, but at more than half the cost of purchasing a new one. And in this age of the Interweb, they expect me to maintain the warranty information, and take no accountability for keeping records themselves. Not an acceptable level of service for a luxury product in the 21st century. Perhaps they could take a customer service lesson from Tumi.

For a $400 plus pen (my wife bought it at a retail shop), I expect durable, quality craftsmanship. That pen was lightly used, but had two manufacturing failures in less than three years. I also expect excellent customer service. I did not get it in this pen.

No more cheap key rings that pull apart after opening them up a few times to insert or remove keys. These are strong and I know that they will hold their shape and the tightness of the ring will not become loosened over time.

Metallic Black finish, Nice styling.

Nice bright white backilit LCD displays on each handset. Tells you if there any answering machine messages or if the line is busy. If there are messages the charging light on phone blinks too.

It has the standard any button answer when off the chargers ( 0-9 and # * )

You can set it to the Auto Talk option, Where you answer the phone by lifting it off the base and hang up by placing it back.

Both phones have hands free speakerphones built into the handsets and theres also one on the main base.

Both phones can share the line at the same time for 3 way conversations.

You can use the phones as ""Walkie Talkies"" either holding them as a regular handset or hands free thru the speakerphones. I use this feature a lot!

Uses 2 widely available AAA NIMH batteries per phone. I believe the batteries were precharged. I put some spares in the phone and charged up the supplied batteries and they were ready in a few minutes. (It seems if you charge the batteries outside the phones, It won't register as fully charged until a few hours later)

Light Up Keypads. Interesting ringtones.

Battery level and Time/Date indicator on each phone.

Clear reception, Excellent voice quality, good range. They have an automatic ""Boost"" feature which boosts reception when it gets weak due to wandering out of range or if there's interference.

Programing one phone automatically communicates and loads data to second phone. If you change the batteries on one phone just put it back on the charger and it will reset time, phone numbers... using the other phones info.

You can check the answering machine messages remotely or from any handset.

Each phone has a headphone jack. Comes with optional belt clips.

(I don't subscribe to Caller ID so I can't use the talking ID function)

Some minor minuses...

Answering Machine has average sound quality. A little warbled but not too bad.

I'm not sure how long the chrome plated silver keys will hold up to constant use.",22,11.380611
700,"These are well - Prismacolor.  One of the top rated colored pencil brands.  I bought these on some sale or another so they were a bit cheaper than they sell for now.

I have been using them in various projects over the last few months and am quite happy with them.  They have a smooth feel to them when the color is applied.  The color is rich enough that even with a light hand a couple layers will give you the results you seek.  They blend very well using a stump and even better with a solvent, which is my preference.  I have had no problem sharpening them, though I use a manual sharpener, and they come to a nice point easily.  Some of the colors crumble a bit if too much pressure is applied but the point doesnt break off.

The only negative I know of, though I have not experienced it yet, would be bloom.  These are waxed based pencils and so after some length of time some of the was will rise to the surface and give a cloudy appearance.  Simple to cure, a small towel or cotton ball very slightly damp can be used to wipe the haze off.  Long term solution is to spray the work with a fixative.

 My grandson came over and did some 'test' prints to see if he wanted this type of printer but after making multiple copies with a lot of noticeable changes on the computer, the printed copies all had the same faded look to them. I do not think we are being too picky!!
 Maybe this is because its the first images printed. They pass for tossing some pictures on a refrigerator but not to frame them.

To connect the printer to the wireless network I had to create an HP account, setup the subscription for the automated ink and have the printer connect to HP servers before being able to use the printer.

If it had a clasp or something, especially with a full roll of stamps, it would work perfectly.  I usually have to add a piece of tape to keep it closed and that doesn't usually hold all that well.

-Occasionally mine with flash. I think the connection to the projector is not good, but who knows. The instructions aren't great on this issue.
-You can only plug in the cords one way, and they are thick cords. It makes the whole unit very hard to arrange how I want on my desk. I have to bend the cords at a severe angle to have the camera positioning the way I want.

The Prera is a serious featherweight of a pen.  My Pilot Kakuno which is also plastic and designed for use by schoolchildren actually felt a bit heavier than this.  It's far too light to use unposted in my opinion.  The cap does post very solidly and gives more balance to the pen as you write.  The color is a bit different from the pictures, but I still like it.  The stainless nib is fairly stiff and needs some breaking in before it starts to shine.

No matter where we place the base,  we end up having calls get dropped -  several times a day.  It's very annoying and frustrating.  I had this problem first with Panasonic's spiffy bluetooth compatible DECT model (KX-TH1212B).

Now I only have the high quality photo inkjet and this new Brother 9840CDW. And it's great -- quality color documents, check printing, black and white documents, laser speed and quality, faxing, copying and scanning. And in a multicomputer household, the unit's built-in networking makes it easily available to all users.

One thing I really like is it's ability to scan a document to a PDF file and have it automatically sent to any computer on the network. Scanning to PDF effectively makes faxing obsolete. It is far better to scan a file and email it to someone than to fax it and kill more trees.

The only thing you should be aware of is this is a big machine. And it's heavy. It shows up in a massive box that you'll have to spend twenty minutes breaking down into small enough pieces to recycle. And get help lifting it. Really.

745,"This so far is what we were looking for. BUT you must use the right kind of staples. Not any ole staple works in these kinds of staplers. There is some cheap things about it. Two in fact. The decal that shows the depth of staple size to sheet of paper ratio was coming up and still continues to need pressing back down from time to time. I could apply some clear tape to hold it in place or even perhaps find some glue that will take care of this annoyance. The moving throat measurer as others have noted is not steady or slips all to easily. This can be a problem if you are doing a lot of units through it. Overall I knew it was a CHEAP version in this category of staplers so do not knock it down for these things. Folks the strike plate comes bent. I often see where someone cry's foul the strike plate bent after just a use or two. Probably it came that way and is suppose to be that way to promote the inner bend of the staple arms when it's pressed down. I chose this one over swinglines similar size item because swingline had numerous complaints about plastic handle breaking. This is metal and it so far is working great. We are not a business so will unlikely have a lot of use for it. But once in a while a club or our own job's require some major thickness of paper stock stapling. This will meet our needs. Otherwise we have to styles of binding systems. The wire kind and the plastic coils we hate plastic combs but the punch for the wire can do comb binding too. So we've undbound all our plastic comb cook books etc. and re did them with WIRE. OH YEAH..love DIY and thinking outside the box. So for under 20 dollars when we bought this it is what we expected. It is not top of the line. Those start around 60 and go on up. We decided if this does not hold up we'll look at the EXPENSIVE ones to replace it. But so far we expect it to do the job. Make sure you buy the right staples. Make sure you always have paper in the strike plate before stapling. Box was damaged but item was just fine inside. So not sure what was with that. The decal sticking issue is my major one star off. The moving and loose throat plate might someone elses. I think you could stick a piece of tape or card stock behind the throat gadget to hold it in place if doing a lot of repeat same depth jobs. I would recommend but with the points emphasied above.

I normally use these pouches cut in half only using one side to laminate to the surface of a print. This has worked great for several years but this new batch I received the lamination easily peels away with almost no for required. I will have to return these and order another brand as I can't have the clear lamination lifting off of my prints. I still have some of my last shipment and they work fine so I know it's not the result of my laminator.

(Original Review) I use this for sealing printed photos. I have only used 4 sheets and already one didn't seal at all to the paper and another ended up with wrinkles. The wrinkles were probably my fault but I just wanted to mention it.
So 1 out of 3 so far is defective which isn't very good odds. I chose the Apache brand because that's what I thought came with my Apache laminator but it doesn't seem to be the same quality.

**UPDATE** 12/24/2014 - I have only had the problem of it not completely sealing 2 more times out of about 25 pouches and those were fixed by running it through my laminator a 2nd time. Since my original review, the seller contacted me directly and issued a refund and replacement products. They have also tried to call me (I sleep during the day) but they couldn't reach me so they emailed me several times to make sure I was happy with the outcome and to offer any assistance with the product. That says ALOT about the seller that they actually care.",50,7.166184

775,"I'd had enough paying in excess of $40 a month just for the voice line alone with my phone company. I don't understand how it is justified to charge customers that much money these days now that so much communication is done through the internet and with smartphones.

It took me several months of methodical execution.  I had copper DSL and phone landlines.  And since keeping my phone number is a non-negotiable must, and since I didn't want to do the looping stuff, I had to first switch to fiber optics internet with my number ported into my phone company's VOIP network.  Then, I had Ooma port my phone number, after which I ditched the VOIP service with my phone company, keeping only the internet.  To my pleasant surprise, Ooma's porting process took only 1 week--although they say it could take 3-4 weeks.

Here is a breakdown in terms of cost:
(1) Ooma Telo: $193-$50 (rebate)= $143.
(2) Premier Annual Subscription.  I got this for $99 with ""free"" number porting.
(3) About $48 for taxes a year.

Total cost for 1st year: $290, which comes down to $24.17 a month.  Even with the Premier subscription, I am still saving money.  What's more, the beauty of this is that I am no longer at the mercy of these phone companies.  I can switch between different ISPs at my choice.

Here is a suggestion you might find useful.  I am not sure whether to get the warranty for the next two years. I believe as with most electronics that have no moving parts, early failures are usually attributed to heat build-up.  (That's the case, for instance, with the many computers I have owned. Issues arise often as a result of inadequate cooling and ventilation.) With the lights on, the underside of the Telo is especially warm.  I have the LED lights on the unit turned to ""off"" at all times. (At the top of the Telo unit, there is a line of three touch buttons. It is the second one.) You don't need these lights anyway, since I gather most of you are already using a separate answering machine.  This should reduce the likelihood of early failure.  If you are gung-ho about this, you can even put a heat sink on the unit's underside by cannibalizing used computer parts such as hard drive coolers or graphics cards.",2,14.219286

It features monthly spreads with a column for notes. The weekly spreads feature three vertical boxes per day covering the morning, afternoon, and evening. I know some people cover these with washi tape or stickers to customize, but those categories do not bother me. The bottom of each page either has faux washi tape or an inspirational quote.

The paper quality is thicker than printer paper with minimal bleed from highly pigmented pens. Each month has a different color scheme and design on the divider page.

I've never owned an arc-based notebook but I can certainly see the appeal after holding this in my hands. It allows you the customization of a three-ring binder or A5 six-ring planner with the ease of a spiral-bound notebook. You can either use a compatible hole puncher or a single hole punch with scissors to insert pages into the planner. With a pinch, they're easy to take out, too.

786,"I will start with a disclaimer: We have cameras on our porch so we do not really need a door bell with video. We just need to be able to talk to the person who rings the bell but we could not find anything like that. Also, we do not want the doorbell to work through our cell phones. We just need to be able to talk to the person who rang the bell. REVIEW: We have a chronically ill family member living with us. She has been sicker than normal this year and was ordered on bed rest and had multiple surgeries and a long recovery. This also required a lot of time in bed. We have done everything we can to make her self sufficient and comfortable. But we failed to realize how much of a problem the doorbell can be to someone who has to be in bed. So we set out to eliminate this for her. She is not left alone all the time, but it seems that when she was, that's when the door bell rang. It left her feeling very upset. She could see the person on the cameras, but she could not communicate with them. When we found these phones it seemed like a perfect solution to our problem. Not only was the doorbell no longer a problem, we could use them as a intercom from her room to anyone else in the house. We ordered them and they arrived well packaged and on time. I read the instructions and we set the system up. The whole process took no longer than an hour! From the doorbell to plugging in the phones to programming them, one hour - max. We are so happy with this purchase! The video is not perfect as others have said, but we don't really need that. The sound is amazing and it is easy to hear the person on the porch and they can hear us. The doorbell in your house will ring then the phone will make a door bell sound. You pick up the phone and it says, ""doorbell ringing - incoming video."" There are options to talk or to ignoreor mute yourself. You decide at that point.  This is also an option when the phone rings. You can ""silence"" the ringing! We love that feature. If you mute, then you can listen to the person on the porch and they can't hear you. The phone itself is very intuitive and ergonomically pleasing for little hands and those who are not as strong as they used to be!  The panel on the phone has wall paper background that you can changed or omit. There is one button voice mail option. The phone does keep a recording of all who have rang your doorbell too. It is just so easy to use in every way. I am a person who doesn't like to learn new electronics all the time and I found it easy to learn. The battery did run out fast on the phone the first day, but since then - it has been conditioned to last longer. If you program the phone with the caller ID of the name of the caller - the phone will announce who is calling. And I thought I liked our old phones! The only advice I would give is to buy the pack with the door bell and three phones. We ended up buying a separate phone because two handsets were not enough for us. The single handset was very easy to set up. You just put the phone on the home base and it programs itself in 30 seconds! Again, we are not using this as a security system and we use a home phone line. I realize this will not work for everyone, but it is perfect for our needs and well worth the money and time to install it. Now we are better prepared for bed rest than we were before.",4,12.089585

794,"Ooma makes an excellent unit that works great. It's important to note that you need quality internet service to use Ooma. This is my second unit that I bought as a backup in case my original unit should fail. The original unit has worked flawlessly for almost two years. Ooma offers many extra features that are extra with most landline services. The extra internet features are very easy to setup and the voice quality is very good. The quality is so good we forget that it is not the wired landline service.

We are using the Ooma two line feature but in some ways it does not allow someone to pickup another phone to join in the call, as the unit switches to the second line. I suspect there is a setting to allow a second user to join in the phone call. Now if someone is on the line every other phone will have the dial tone for a new line. A great feature is phone messages can be retrieved via email. Call forwarding is very simple and can be set to any phone including your smartphone. Another great feature is you can block any phone number or direct it to a message or whatever you want.

Ooma service is relatively inexpensive and is as reliable as your internet service. If your internet service is unreliable or down, your Ooma service won't work during those interruptions. This the one downside to Ooma. The full year rate offers some savings so consider that as another benefit if you chose to keep costs down. Ooma will frequently offer something extra (device) for paying for a years service.

If you plan to port your regular landline number to Ooma, it can take weeks so you need to maintain that number and service until the number is ported over to Ooma. It's unknown why it takes so long when cellphone service number porting can takes less than 2 hours or faster..The few times I've needed customer service, it's been good and reliable like the service.

The Ooma extension modules work well and we have two units for separate phone areas. Once in a while they get flaky and a simple reboot (unplugging the unit and plugging it back in) usually solves the problem.)

Overall, I consider my purchase of Ooma device and service an excellent purchase and it is a very good value. It's not free but it's worth it. If your internet service is not reliable you may need to reconsider using Ooma as your main phone service especially If your cellphone service seems more reliable, the Ooma device and service can be a great backup service..",7,10.283215

Putting it all together was a breeze and it's mighty nice in appearance.

I really like the LCD touchscreen,it's where you go to to tell this machine what you want done,the only actual button on the unit is the on/off button,which is a new thing for me. The various functions only illuminate when their functions are valid at that time,so it makes it a bit less confusing.

I've done some printing now and the sheets look pretty good,I'm been using Canon for years and the Lexmark prints at about the same speed but the duplex printing is easier and faster than the Canon.

This printer's inks are set up with individual tanks for the three colors & the black,which is what I'm used to and prefer.

This model also has a scanner that has a 8.5 x 11.7 inches copy area and it's fine for my everyday business copying,letters,bills,receipts etc,but for more adventurous scanning that requires a higher resolution I'm going to stick elsewhere.

Setting up the wireless is very easy and direct,it's something I will be using in the spring and I can't comment on the actual use currently but seems surprisingly simple. It is web-enabled but I don't see the advantage there so I'm going pass on that at this time.

Fortunately, since the printer lives a couple of feet from my Linksys wireless router, I could skip using the built in wi-fi and potentially a lot of time and headaches. With reading the instructions very carefully and perusing Brother's online faq, the process went smoothly, though plug and play this isn't.

The printer is fast and prints great text. 4 point Times New Roman is crisp and easily readable. One problem that I haven't seen mentioned is that this printer is pretty lame when it comes to printing graphics, and that's not just photos but Excel charts and clip art, anything with gradients. The graphics quality is about what I expect from a not too well calibrated Kinkos copier  But, since I bought this for text, my main printing output, and I have an excellent Canon inkjet for graphics, that is a minor concern.

Like many recent HP models, this calculator can work in either RPN or algebraic mode, but I use only RPN.  The keyboard layout has been well thought out, with most functions being quickly available directly from the keyboard and a few lesser-used functions available through menus.  The keyboard has a traditional HP layout and colors, and the keys have a nice positive feel.  A very thorough and well-written printed manual is included.

A new feature with this model is that each level in the four-level stack may hold a real number, complex number, or 2- or 3-element vector.  Complex numbers may be entered very simply using the ""i"" key (or ""theta"" key for polar form); vectors are entered using square brackets.  This design makes it very easy to manipulate complex numbers and vectors.

The calculator includes 30 kB of memory, which is enough for over 20,000 program steps.  There are 26 main memory registers (A-Z), six statistical registers, and 800 more memory registers available through indirect addressing.  Another new feature of this model is TWO indirect registers, (I) and (J).

A few cons:  With previous HP calculators, there was a shortcut for entering exact powers of 10: for example, 10,000 could be entered as ""E 4"".  For some reason HP has dropped that feature on the 35S, so you now have to enter ""1 E 4"".  Not a major drawback, but kind of annoying since I used that shortcut a lot on previous models.  Another nit is that the function to convert HMS to decimal hours is labeled HMS-> instead of ->H, which I haven't gotten used to yet.

Overall, the HP 35S is a very well-designed calculator, and I would not hesitate to recommend it as the best general-purpose scientific calculator available today.  In fact, I bought three (for home, work, and school).

*** UPDATE JAN. 2015 ***

After having used this calculator for a while, I would say the feature I miss most is the lack of rectangular/polar conversion functions.  It's possible to (sort of) do something equivalent using the built-in complex number functions, although it isn't really the same; you can't select components of the results very easily.  I found the best option was to write programs called ""P"" and ""R"" to do the equivalent of R->P and P->R, even though that either messes up the stack or uses memory registers.

I would still say this is the best scientific (non-graphing) calculator in this price range, but for my everyday use I've switched to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HP-15C-Scientific-Calculator/dp/B005EIG3MW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HP 15C Scientific Calculator</a>&nbsp;.  It would be nice to see HP come out with an HP-35SII that features:  (1) R->P and P->R functions; (2) the scientific notation shortcut (e.g. E4 as short for 1E4); (3) re-labeling the HMS-> function as ->H to be consistent with previous models; (4) re-label the ""!"" as ""x!"" for better readability.",170,14.671945

810,"Verified purchaser:
I dbl dare yah to find a lower price on this paper, or most other papers sold at Amazon.com combined with speedy shipping. I receive many complements using this paper with my 1/4 fold cards. The paper is for laser use. However, it works great with inkjet type printers too. But note!: The paper will need a lot of time to room dry as it takes time to soak into the paper. I use a hair dryer on the low heat setting, and it drys very well in less than a minute with no smudging. An inkjet printer's color will easily rival the prints of a color laser printer with this paper. It's also substantially less expensive than the heavier weight photo papers sold by the inkjet printer companies. Of course, each has their place, but when used for cards that get thrown out after their intended greeting the cost savings is tremendous. This paper is a winner in many ways. Give it a try because there's nothing negative about it when compared to the higher cost of other similar papers. The 32# weight when folded  into 1/4 fold is 32#x4 which makes for a substainal weight card. The 95 brightness is perfect as it's not blinding bright to appreciate the high gloss. It can be printed on both sides also. The paper will put a smile on your face, and held in high regards by its recipient.",3,8.860863
811,"I have used this product repeatedly and it works very, very well.

My main board is a midpriced Quartet 3'x4' gridline board. This product restores it to ""like new"" condition and leaves the surface slick and pleasurable to write or draw upon.

Here is the cleaning process I use:

1. Basic dry cleaning with paper towel, fabric cloth or felt/styrofoam eraser.

2. Apply spray cleaner and rub with paper towel or cloth to remove marks left after step 1.

3. (not always needed) Clean stubborn stains by spraying with liquid cleaner and rubbing with the Magic Eraser Whiteboard Eraser.

4. Let board dry thoroughly.

5. Apply conditioner and allow to dry thoroughly

6. Buff thoroughly

The conditioner is a bit messy, as other reviewers have noted. It also has a definite scent-sort of a combination of citrus fruit and petroleum product (it is a petroleum distillate. I dislike the scent, but it is not strong enough to give me a headache as strong household cleaners often do.

I don't find the mess to be an issue. I use the conditioner for deep cleaning after I've finished a project or if marker ghosting becomes an impediment.

The slick, slightly oily finish left on the board surface does show scuffing when I do interim erasing during my workflow, but it is an aesthetic issue and does not hamper my marking or basic erasing between deep cleanings. The scuffing is only visible from certain angles.

This product, when used correctly, makes my Quartet board look great. It doesn't perform quite as well on my inexpensive boards from Foray, but I assume that is caused by the material Foray uses in their construction.

Yes, there are drawbacks to using this product. It is messy and the issues common to most petroleum distillates (odor, environmental impact of manufacturing) are present. But other than using a glass board and a nonpetroleum product, I don't know of any other user applied product that performs so well.

Highly recommended.",10,9.35767

813,"As slide scanners go, this one is designed to be pretty user friendly -- no computer required, small color preview screen, and saves to (an included) SD card.  The ""scans"" (really, it's taking a picture of the slide with a small CCD above the slide/negative that's lit from below) are completed very quickly, and the auto-focus and auto-exposure that takes place during scanning seem to do a good job, although the auto-color balance leaves some color-balancing work to be done on a computer.  The image quality of the scans is about what you'd expect from something that works this quickly, at this price point, where the main selling point is convenience -- they're okay.  If you're mostly interested in being able to see the subject matter of your photos of family vacations and parties, then this will fit the bill.  If you want to capture all the quality that you can out of your slides/negatives, you'll have to spend a bit more, or consider other approaches.

It's probably safe to assume that if you're considering buying a slide and negative scanner, it's not because you're still shooting photos on film.  Rather, you have boxes or binders full of old photographs that you want brought up to date.  So a slide scanner is the kind of thing you would buy for exactly one extremely labor-intensive project, and then get rid of.

A more user-friendly approach to the box-of-slides-problem would be to utilize any one of a large number of professional slide/negative scanning services, which allow you to mail a box of slides/negatives and get back a DVD with high resolution photos that have been corrected in various ways (scratches, dirt, color cast).  Given the price of this dedicated slide scanner, and the low cost of scanning services (between fifteen and thirty cents per slide), the service might be a better solution (unless the photos you want to digitize number in the thousands).

The quality of the resultant scans that this scanner produces is not that high - if you're looking to archive your treasured family photos, and determined to do it yourself, you might be well advised to purchase a more expensive slide scanner (possibly used) and to recoup most of that hardware cost by selling the scanner once you've scanned all your old photos.

Alternatively, instead of a slide scanner, you could also use the same amount of money to purchase a reasonably good quality flatbed scanner with a slide/film tray (e.g.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/this-nice-Canon/dp/B00AGV7TQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">this nice Canon</a>), and enjoy the additional features of a flatbed scanner.  The tradeoff there is between speed/convenience and quality/functionality -- it will take a lot longer to scan with the moving scanner head in a flatbed than it will with this speedy dedicated slide scanner, and you'll need an attached computer to scan, but you'll be able to get better image quality and enjoy the other features of a flatbed (document scanning, print scanning, etc.).

Judging this scanner on its merits, it is undeniably convenient, fast, and easy to use -- which is exactly the feature set it promises.  It is, however, also a single-use device that will have no role in your house once you've scanned all your slides, and doesn't deliver the highest quality results.",122,14.644658
814,"This is an excellent combination printer, the latest in a long line of technically superior printers. This printer is easy to set-up, easy to use, and the newest ""E"" features is a superb idea. Being able to e-mail the printer and print items from a distance is a wonderful facility. I have not had this printer very long, so I have no idea about reliability of longevity. But- if it is anything like all of my other HP printers, it will last forever and remain problem-free for many years.

Buying HP printers is a very good investment, they last forever. When you finally get rid of a HP printer,it will still be working well. The replacement reason will be that a newer HP offers something that the older model does not. I highly recommend this printer, based upon my previous experience with HP all-in-one printers.

UPDATE- January, 2012 - After very light usage, the print head broke, rendering this machine unusable. I am surprised, HP has always had good printers.

What an amazing price, for a HP printer that does everything but walk your copies to you. I will see if the difficulties that I experienced are still evident in the brand new model. I doubt that that will be the case. HP has good printers. I have 2 Office Jets from 1999 and from 2004 that are great, no problems at all.

I may have more pens then I'll be able to use in my lifetime, but my sons will be very well stocked for their entire school careers. Until now, there has been just one pen that I won't share - the Staedtler triplus fineliner. These Jetstream pens may just get added to the list.

The ink is super smooth. It just glides over the paper. The barrel is thick enough to be comfortable to grip and it's rubberized, too. I also like that the ink is slightly dark, thanks to the black/other colors mix. That is especially helpful when I write on darker, natural fibre paper where lighter pens tend to disappear. I can't wait to try this in my art journals to see how well it holds up. It is definitely great for my regular note taking and journaling.

I've liked a lot of the Uni-ball products before, but I think they really hit it out of the park with this one. The only question remaining is... how MUCH mileage will I get out of one pen? Time will tell, and I'll come back to update when that has been answered.",5,6.5418367

If pen isn't writing, perhaps the cartridge either wasn't snapped in correctly or you have a clogged nib.  I did wash my fountain pen nib first -- knowing it hadn't been used in 10+ years.  I rinsed my nib until water ran clear.  In a bad clog, I imagine soaking a half-hour might be needed but mine needed no soaking.

822,"These markers are intended for adding detail, as they have ultra-fine tips.  What I like is the colors they include.  There are colors that you never see except in very large or very expensive marker sets.  That said, the cap colors do not match the ink color in most of the pens, which doesn't mean that the colors that they are isn't pretty.

My biggest complaint, and the reason that I gave 4 stars instead of 5, is that the avertisement photo includes colors which are not at all in the set I received.  Which makes me wonder if they have more than 20 colors available, because I do have colors which are not included in the photo.  I was really looking forward to the 3 purples shown in the photo, as well as the 2 light brown or flesh colored pens.  AND, the reason that the photo shows only 19 colors is that they included 2 black pens, in the set they sent me.  I suppose this is for the people that use the black for drawing or perhaps writing.  I very rarely use black as I only use my sets for coloring in my adult coloring books.

825,"I have been using it for over a week now. I do not use the mousing surface, which is not very high quality to begin with. The palm rest is a great find.

On paper, this device is a great idea. It's a palm rest that goes with your hand. This compares favorably to mouse pads with a fixed palm rest that pulls your wrist skin if you try to move the mouse without lifting your hand. Furthermore, the designer left out space in the middle of the foam of the palm rest so that there is no direct pressure to the middle of the wrist.

The problem is that it is really hard to keep the palm rest aligned with the mouse as you move. The palm rest ends up in somewhat arbitrary orientation, and the second benefit is lost. I end up taping the bottom of the mouse to the palm rest and the orientation is now fixed. Effectively, I am using a mouse that has built-in a foam palm rest. See the photos I uploaded.",25,7.3228717

862,"This is a cheap piece of plastic...

I got this phone for my mom. We Skype all the time, but a direct line of communication, such as a desktop phone, would be better.

Look and feel:
This LOOKS cheap - all over. The phone cord isn't even (it's got all kinds of bumps in it...), you have to assemble it like you've just bought a kit, the headset doesn't properly fit on the hanger (and that little square thing keeps moving... so crappy). I don't know if the other reviewer TAPED that phone on the table, but it moves around like no other. It's very light because it's 100% cheap plastic. Worse yet... you try to hand the handset on the hanger, and the *whole* phone tips sideways, because no one has thought of how it would weigh if someone *actually* used it. The screen on the phone is tiny, and my mom can't read anything on it...

Usage:

You open the box, and first off, you have to ""build your own""... manual's not very helpful. The handset doesn't hang on the hanger.

When you plug it in, it takes a good 15mn to start... I've since then bought an IPEVO SOLO, that takes a whole 1mn to start. So if you ever plug it off and have to plug it by in, make sure you're no hurry... it takes for EVER.

The handset quality: the audio quality was very average. I believe it's because of the wiring and the quality of the components inside the phone.
The speaker quality: that had to be the worse. It sounded like the other person was all scrambled, the way that would happen if it was miswired or something. The amount of static was so overwhelming that you thought you were talking to a robot. Lame.

Overall: the processor inside that phone must be extremely cheap, because it didn't deal with information very well. If you have background noise on your side or the other person's side, then kiss your conversations goodbye. This phone is cheap and they really cut corners on every aspect of the phone: not very durable (handset not hanging, back of the phone not supporting the phone very well, phone cord all uneven), not very clear (conversation all static in speaker, lag in handset use, static when background noise), not very efficient (every menu option has a lag, can't press too many buttons in a row).

Conclusion: cheap. Very cheap. For all the wrong reasons.",9,9.954793
863,"Own a Palm TX? Avoid this at all costs!

As others have noted, and as documented on the Palm support forums, this cradle has a major incompatibility with the Palm TX. It will cause the Palm TX to lockup, requiring a soft reset (using the reset hole on the back). There is unfortunately no solution, and no predicting when the lock will occur. Sometimes, after one HotSync it will lock, sometimes if the computer is placed into sleep and then reawakened, other times just sitting there.

Palm has a patch on their site that supposedly fixes this problem, but it actually makes matters worse - with the patch installed, the TX will lock when not even docked. DON'T install the patch!

Interestingly, the problem appears to be a hardware design flaw of the cradle itself. If you plug the TX into the included connector, and NOT the cradle, no problems! I suspect it has something to do with the silly LED light that always stays on - perhaps a static discharge problem.",19,8.149659

Another thing to note is that the desk is very smooth and slightly slanted so my mouse tends to slide off unless I'm careful.

872,"I can't even tell you how much I love this planner already and I've only been using it for a couple weeks...scheduling things for the new year since mid December. It is thinner than my old planner by almost half, so that makes it so much easier to carry around. I like that the covers are made of a stiff plastic and the back is rigid cardboard. This way if I have to schedule things at a busy meeting I can write with it on my lap and still read what I wrote. I thought it would be a lot taller than my old planner, but it is basically the same size of a piece of copy paper.
I work in 5 different schools and they all have different class schedules. The light dotted lines on the top section of each day allows me to customize each day schedule and fit everything perfectly. The bottom section with the hours of the day help me keep track of appointments that have a specific time of day. In previous planners I never had room for both. I would have to squeeze in scheduling for my one school that has 10 classes a day and could barely read my notes. There is a ton of room for notes, random doodles and such for each week.
The beginning of each month provides a section to write goals...I love this type of thing not just for goals but for keeping track of what I need to do for each month. Then there is a full page that shows the month including the holidays. This is where I keep track of my paydays. Obviously the most important part of the planner. ;)
I love that each week shows the full month calendar for the month before and after the current month. My previous planner didn't do that it and I did miss not being able to glance up in the corner to see the week before if it was the beginning of the month.
The pages are thinner than I imagined they would be, but they don't bleed through when I write in pen.
Oh...and on the side of the planner are little grey boxes that have a small number next to them. If you are looking to flip to June, you either count down six boxes or peek at the grey boxes until you see the #6. LOVE this part because my last planner didn't have anything to designate month from month so I had to flip through to find different months.
Some of these things may seem somewhat minor, but when you do stats each month for five different schools, you rely on a planner to keep track of events and often have to flip back and forth from month to month.
There is a good amount of space for Saturday and Sunday as well. So many other planners have a little slice of space for the weekend. I have my own business and do per diem social work on the weekends, so I need to be able to write a few things for each weekend day.
I can see ordering this planner every year from now on. It has taken me several tries to find something that really fits all my needs!
One final thing. The front of the planner itself is actually clear. So you can put whatever you want on the front page and it is your planner cover. One of my students drew a picture for me to put on there. I love that I have a unique piece of art for my planner!",4,10.189572

876,"I bought one of these Pewter Nemosine Fission pens with the 0.8 calligraphy nib almost by accident, when I was first starting up again with fountain pens after not using them for years.  I had always preferred metal pens so I ordered this one, but what I had in mind was something like my old Sheaffer Targa, a slim-bodied brushed steel pen (very nice by the way, I still love it).  I was unprepared for the thick, solid brass item I received - I'd forgotten how big some fountain pens could be.  And I didn't mean to order the italic nib, made some mistake in the ordering process.  But as accidents go, it turned out to be a lucky one.  I had a bit of trouble at first adjusting to the size and very heavy weight of the pen (for me with my small hands, it works better unposted), but fell immediately in love with the smooth italic nib and the very high quality of manufacture of every detail of this beast.  After a little practice, I now find it very comfortable to use.  And it has a 3 year guarantee!  Not only that, but the pen colour turns out to be a perfect match for my beloved Rohrer & Klingner Sepia ink, which looks gorgeous in italic writing. After giving the pen an initial flush when I first got it, I've had no trouble with it starting up or writing smoothly and reliably, and certainly no leakage.

I can't understand why this brand isn't better known.  Possibly it's because of the fairly common complaints about the Nemosine Singularity (plastic) pens having problems with their caps cracking.  However, the Fission is another thing altogether.  Nothing on this metal pen is going to crack, and it's built like a tank.

Then I replaced the black cartridge I got this message, ""Ink cartridges cannot be recognized"" and I couldn't proceed.  Nothing I did seemed to work, so I emailed Techcopy, the company I purchased these from (through Amazon) in Aug. of 2010.  I had a reply in less than 6 hours and here's what they suggested:

""Please try re-inserting the cartridges as per the following instructions:
Remove the cartridges, shut off the printer and unplug it. While you unplug it hold the power button for a moment, then wait five minutes. Install the cartridges one by one, and it should work fine.""

I did exactly what they suggested and it's working fine now.  Note that I didn't replace all the cartridges, just the black one, but I removed all of them and then reinserted.  The other colors had various amounts of ink still remaining.

The color looks great to me and I don't really notice the difference between this ink and the more expensive stuff.  Plus, these are remanufactured which I guess means refilled, and it's always good to reuse things when we can.

I deal with a variety of home/small business printers almost daily and consider Canon to be the most reliable.  The MF6160dw tested my belief and failed.  I purchased this printer to replace an HP P1102W that was never able to stay awake.  The MF6160dw was overkill, but Canon does not make a print-only monochrome laser printer that is capable of Airprint and Google Cloud print.

The Good:  The MF6160dw was easy to setup.  The display makes it simple to check the process as you work through setup.  This is a big plus over typical print-only machines that do not have a display.  My unit was able to print from the bypass tray.  It was very fast and the quality superb.  I did not try the scanner.

The Bad:  My MF6160dw never did detect paper in the main paper Tray.  Canon tech support walked me through their script for one hour on the phone.  I opted to return it to Amazon for refund.

887,"I bought this pen because I wanted be all hipster tumblr and write in cursive in my journal. I saw the price and said, ""okay, why not?"" This pen is alright, the ink that this comes with is terrible, though, so I would recommend you to buy a converter and good ink such as Noodler's.

Some complaints:
- The nib isn't as ""extra fine"" as I'd like it to be, the thickness of the writing that I achieve with this pen is definitely thicker than  .5 mm.
- I've noticed that the ink leaks out onto the top of the nib, so if you hate having the ink there, you might have to constantly wipe it. I don't really care much about it, though.
- The grip is shaped so that you have to hold it in the ""traditional"" hand writing style, so if you hold it any other way it's really uncomfortable and your hand will actually start to hurt. I don't really use this pen as much anymore because of this.

It works fine as a pen, but the result looks to be the same as any other gel or felt pen. So if you're hoping to change the look of your writing when looking at this pen, I would suggest to get a good gel pen for a quarter of the price. However, if you're looking for a pen that gives you a better writing experience, the feel of this pen when writing is very smooth, especially when you hold it in the ""traditional way"".

Conclusion: Don't get this pen if you're trying to achieve that flourishy cursive look to your handwriting because anything done with this pen can be easily achieved with a regular pen.

These are great for detail work since you get a very thing line. One word of caution is to be careful while sharpening these since they are very thin, a little bit of sharpening goes a long way, otherwise you can break the point easily.

They are long lasting so long you are careful and do not over sharpen them.

896,"I have a Canon Pixma printer and the glossy cardstock is excellent! The cards are scored so they can be easily and uniformly folded after printing. If you create a card with a photo, this glossy card stock truly brings out the colors beautifully. If you have a line drawing or only print on your cards, regular cardstock will be fine. I've run off the same card with a photo on regular cardstock (not glossy) and then on these glossy cards and the difference is absolutely amazing. The glossy side brings out the beauty of the photo and the cards look professional. Intend to reorder again. Love it!",7,8.295086
897,"I grew up under Southern Bell Telephone and the rotary dial. Yeah, that's how old I am. Nonetheless, then it was AT&T and everybody had their phones. Well not anymore. This RCA is quite nice and I was pleasantly surprised with the ease in which to set it up ( us old folks have no patience and poor eye sight - just kidding). I spent many years in an office environment and black and silver is elegant, professional. This phone has clarity, easy to use and set, large buttons, a sexy woman's voice to answer the phone, and it is a bargain at Amazon's price. So, you don't have to buy expensive to get good looks, a great product or have taste. For anyone looking to replace that AT&T cr--, go for it, you won't be disappointed.

But you really need to be ""thinking"" purple to see it, at least under my office flourescents. For people that care about ink, will be a somewhat individualistic, but not really whimsical choice.

905,"This is a nice, relatively inexpensive phone that works well and has good sound quality. Voices sound much better on here than they do over annoying portable or cellular phones (especially the latter); there's nothing like having a good landline when you want to have a real conversation with people.

The phone looks nice and has a big, easy to read display.  The dial buttons are plenty big so you shouldn't have any misdialed calls.

My only complaint is the batteries don't last long. And none of the functions such as caller ID work if the batteries are dead (although you can still make calls). On top of that, the batteries are very difficult to remove making it a pain to deal with, especially when the phone drains batteries so rapidly. Hence the 4 instead of 5 star rating.  Otherwise it is a very nice phone.",7,6.642922
906,"I have several different color inks, but I can post only one review. So here are my thoughts on a couple of the colors:

The blue-black is Pilot/Namiki's idea of blue-black. It's not mine. It's definitely darker than their regular blue, so it's not like there was a mix-up in packaging or anything. But I would describe it as a dark blue rather than blue-black. If you hate most of the blue-blacks you've tried before, thinking they're more teal or gray and not blue enough, maybe this is the blue-black for you. However, it took longer to wash it out of my Plumix than the green and purple did. It seems to like to stick to the plastic.

The sepia was also not what I expected. Maybe that's my fault: I thought sepia would be a yellowish-brown. (The photo on Amazon was unhelpful, looking like a neutral brown, which also would have been fine.) However, Google tells me it's reddish-brown. Well, that's my bad. However, even if reddish-brown is correct for sepia, I'm not sure sepia is as reddish-brown as this ink. This ink is closer to brownish-red, in fact. Like a brick. It's not bad, actually, and it's a fine addition to my collection of dark/muted reds. It just wasn't what I had in mind for my BROWNS collection.

Both the blue-black and the sepia inks are well-behaved. They flow nicely, don't bleed through paper readily, and the colors look good without being too bright or too light. Just be aware that if you are picky about your blue-blacks and your browns, you'll want to get a good idea of exactly what color you're getting with these inks.",7,10.515575
907,"Got the printer in 2014 for 69 bucks.  Haven't used it much, but when I do it prints well.

I pulled my hair out for a day trying to get it to print recently.

Finally, I cleaned the nozzles, etc. and what do you know....after previous blank pages, it started printing again.

I have decided that I have to print something every single day....

you have to keep the nozzles from getting clogged.  Printing uses less ink than cleaning them.",2,4.272122
908,"I think it is always wise to buy the combo pack because you save some money that way.  I do run through the black cartridges
more frequently than color, but it seems you don't get as many copies with color as you do black.  I notice the XL cartridges do last longer than the regular.  I did price ink cartridges before buying a new printer and found these cartridges were reasonable.
So overall I am pleased with this product.",5,5.497938
909,"The positives are covered already by a lot of folks.  No need to boot the computer, dials off the contact list, etc.

But the phone is a bit dated now.  If I were using this as a main line instead of a supplement to my cell phone, I'd find an easier to use arrangement like maybe one of the newer phones or one of the adapters that allows regular phones to be plugged in it.

The physical cord connections on the Belkin are poorly thought out.  For example there are keyhole mounting slots so it can be wall mounted, but all the cords stick out the back of the phone, making that physically impossible.  Even the power cord which has a 90 degree bend is above the level of the mounts.

They give a very tall plastic attachment for desk use which eliminates any cord issues, but could easily have put any connections on the sides and made it wall mountable as well.

The software is not capable of many newer Skype features.  Contacts with more than one number only dial one of the numbers.  There's no way to select among the numbers.  You have to do the old Skype way of having a separate entry for cell, home, work, etc. for each contact.  And while Skype on the computer knows which country you're in, you have to add the + in front of manually dialed numbers.  So I keep falling into the 00 trap where I don't wait long enough and end up with 18+ instead of 1800.  A separate + key would have been great, or even if the # key was used for the plus, it would have been so much easier.

Since these features have been in Skype for a while and there's no update for this phone, it may not be possible with the hardware.  As of November 2009, Skype for the Belkin is version 1.0.1.3, dated Aug 1, 2008.

Other than the clunky usage, call quality is pretty good, although much better on the handset than the speakerphone.  I wouldn't use the speakerphone for an important call.  Overall, if you're more likely to receive calls than to call out or use this just a little, it's pretty good.  For more frequent usage, it might be worth looking for more expensive options.

2010 Update:  There has not been a software update in 2 years, so looks like there never will be.  One big problem is as of last Summer, the adapter that plugs into the outlet started emitting a very high pitched constant noise.  Not sure how to describe it, but it would be a hum if it were lower frequency.  It is barely audible, but extremely annoying and not really worth buying a new adapter.  Definitely recommend looking for some of the newer Skype phones now.",2,9.743621
910,"Best Sharpies for fine writing, very minimal bleeding, and very durable.  I welcome the click and you can write instead of dealing with a cap that can be lost.  I've used these for fine detail work on paintings too.  I prefer this pen for most of my writing and I write using block letters most of the time.  I love this pen for fine details when I zentangle and I think any artists would find this set useful.  I do have a sharpie addiction but if the tips are pressed too hard or not used properly they do fall apart or lose their tight tip.  Plus, they don't work well if you are writing on a textured surface.  The paper you're using matters with the smaller tip because the tip is so tiny that if there is lots of tooth to your paper the tip can skip over spots leaving missing parts of the lines.  Finally, the ink flows very smoothly with smooth paper so I find continuous lines very easy and it's a pleasure to write with these when those conditions are met.  Finally, of all the sharpies I believe these have the least amount of bleed through.  I recommend this permanent ink for writing checks because it's no easy task to erase it.",2,5.1797256

The legs are adjustable, which is super. The legs also have rubber tips which grip the surface they are on very well - no slipping and sliding. The legs are made of aluminum tubing - not a sleek look. In fact, a bit clunky, but I so love the functionality, and the fact that I am not stuck sitting, sitting, sitting all day, that I'll overlook that. Also, I would prefer clunky but solid and solidly functional legs to something sleeker and cooler looking that does not provide this kind of sturdy reliability. 5) It's made in America so the company provides jobs to workers in the U.S. Yay, them!

The marker tray is great for holding my markers and my eraser.  The big test for me, was to see how well this board would clean up after I was done.

Do youself a favor and invest in something more robust or you'll find this thing cracking and your chair breaking through to the floor in just a few weeks of use.

I've had these on: hardwood, shag carpet, and low carpet. Shag carpet is obviously the worst, followed by low carpet, then hardwood - but no matter what, this mat will break apart sooner than you'll expect. I ended up buying a different mat that, while totally different in appearance, has lasted since April 2011 and is still in perfect condition...

949,"I'm totally addicted to planners and writing notebooks so was thrilled to receive this item free for my objective evaluation and unbiased review. There are many reasons why I like this particular one, but I understand that the look, feel, and construction are individual desires and this may or may not be the perfect one for your needs.

I like the gray color, and though I really prefer leather exterior and even a zipper closure, I like the material on this one well enough. I definitely appreciate the orange band that you can use to keep the notebook closed. The extra large pocket on the outside is a very nice touch and I can see using it for many different items, most probably will be my mobile phone -- a Samsung Note 5. There is also a compartment on the front for you to store a writing implement. It's great that this cover can be reused -- if you don't like the pages inside or the type included, you can remove it and replace it with another type of planner, agenda or notepaper.

Inside the cover you will find the graph paper in a spiral binding. I like the binding because you can lay it open and flat. The graph paper is unique, and each page has space for date and a memo number in the top margin. The paper itself is nice and thick -- good for me because I use gel and other markers that tend to bleed through -- but not on this paper. I have never had graph paper inside a notebook before so this might take some getting used to!  The cover is nice and sturdy on the spiral binding.

Also on the inside are a couple of small pockets and a slide area for additional papers, documents, ID, credit cards or whatever. On the back inside is another larger pocket for you to use as needed. Lots of places for you to tuck receipts or business cards, etc. Another nice touch is the metal weighted ribbon bookmark to hold your page.

I really like this and definitely will use it for a long time. The material seems like it will hold up to some wear and tear and I noticed that it dried very quickly when I accidentally got some water spilled on the top of the notebook. Very pleased and can recommend it. I've paid a lot more in the past for notebooks and this one seems a good value to me.",2,10.204729
950,"I bought these to print out pictures, cut them up into puzzle pieces, and place them on a magnetic rectangle so they can be rearranged into the right places. The magnet they are placed on is pretty substantial (at least the thickness of all 5 sheets of this paper), and the puzzle pieces stick fine when the whole thing is lying on a table, but when I lift it up sometimes the pieces fall off!

I tried sticking a piece on my fridge and it wouldn't stay--and the packaging says it will stick AND hold up a piece of paper on most metal surfaces. I couldn't get it to stick at all! And the magnetic paper just stuck on a good magnet doesn't even stay very well when it's lifted off the table so that gravity is affecting the pieces. Overall, it works fine for my purposes because the puzzles are meant to stay on a table, but I just can't see any use for them beyond that.",10,6.4354544

954,"Note that I speak about laser printers, while this is an LED printer it works the same way (as opposed to an inkjet) as laser by melting toner powder and fusing it to the page, so anything I say about laser printers applies to this one.

Be aware that a laser or LED printer like this one does not use ink. It uses toner, which is either a wax-type solid like crayons, or a powder like flour or powdered sugar. (Circa 1995 I used to reload laser fax machines by refilling the tank from a bottle of black toner.) Similar to inkjet printers, the toner is packed in a cartridge that you replace when the cartridge runs low.

The toner cartridges are around $90 for all 4 or about $25 each which will get you about 2000 pages, for a cost of about 2c/page black, 10c/page color. One reason for using laser or LED printing is that black pages are usually cheaper on laser or LED vs. inkjet but you often could not get inexpensive color laser printers. But with an LED printer like this it does bring the price point down.

One thing I used to do was, to make letterheads, I would do ""spot color"". I would print the parts of blank letterhead in advance that were in color on an inkjet printer, then set those aside for when I'd print letters which I would print the black parts of the letter on the laser, reducing cost per page. The lower price point for LED printers like this reduces the cost for small-volume printing low enough to make it worthwhile to not go through all that effort and just use the LED printer for the entire document as opposed to a hybrid inkjet/laser solution.

If you do medium volumes, probably up to about 2000 pages a month this is probably a good choice. If you do low volumes (under 100 pages a month) you probably want to go with something less expensive like an inkjet.

But if you'd like something for medium volume this might not be a bad idea. Be advised a laser or LED has a separate drum for each color in addition to the toner, and in the case of a laser/LED printer replacing the drum is usually not worth it. I've bought inexpensive monochrome lasers where the printer was as low as $75, the toner cartridge which would do about 2000 pages was $60, but the drum which has to be replaced after about 6000 pages, cost $149 whereas you can buy a brand new or remanufactured printer with a brand-new drum for again, $80 to $100. So figure you'll keep buying toner cartridges as you run printouts but typically when a drum wears out you'll usually toss the printer and buy another one, probably with more features for less money.

So account for the expected lifetime of the drum(s) because you'll have to spend as much as the printer costs either to replace the drum(s) (if you're crazy!) or (more likely) replace the printer.",39,14.628754
955,"This can be worth it if you print about the same amount every month and the convenience of not needing to order cartridges is worth a little to you. If you print a few pages a week, or you print almost all black and white, this is not a good deal. If you print a lot of pictures consistently, this is the way to go! It's certainly nice for ink to just show up rather than me making a run to walmart and realizing the store has everything but the cyan I need!

I got a trial for the 300 per month page. If I actually print 300 pages in that month, It would cost me about 3.5 cents per page. So if I use this printer only for 4x6 or even full page pictures, that's actually pretty cheap. But if I use it for almost all black and white text, it's about twice what I would expect to pay for ink. And remember, you still have to pay for paper.

The reason I canceled is because I tend to print sporadically. I'll go for a month where I need to print a lot and then I'll have a month or two where I don't print as much. But now I'm thinking the next time my wife wants to do a scrapbook--why not get a 300 page card and we'll join for a month again? I wonder if that will work?",2,8.103956

961,"I have long looked for a well constructed foot rest that would improve my ergonomics at my home office.  This fits the bill in many ways with some draw backs.

The wide platform allows for shifting of position while still supporting the feet.

This is solid and well constructed.  This will outlast any plastic foot rest several times over.

Adjusts easily  -- I have left the angle adjustment loose so I can rock my feet back and forth allowing for increased flexibility and comfort.

Stays in place and does not walk along my carpet (unlike the lighter weight one I have at work)

Since I use this at home I am often bare foot.  Unlike the one at work (which is plastic) I can not with bare feet slip my feet along the edge to reposition it.

Overall, this is a much better footrest than the cheap plastic ones I have had at work settings.

update 11/28/2010 --

First of all I really like this footrest.  It has really made my home computer desk much more comfortable.

The only draw back is the edges.  I have repeatedly scraped my feet on the edge of the footrest.  I put duct tape along all the edges and have not scraped my toes any more.

963,"I have been using HP calculators since the HP35 and HP45 came out in the early 1970s.  Oops I gave away my age.  My first husband and I were in college--he was an engineering student and I was a physics student.  Years later in the early 1990s I got my favorite calculator of all time--the HP-32SII.  I used it lovingly until it finally died this past year.  Even though I don't strictly need a powerful scientific calculator anymore, I feel its loss immensely.  Finally after a lot of waiting, I got an HP 35S.  I noticed right away that the labels were harder to read for the functions and that the display was VERY hard for me to read.  The dots that are not lit up bleed through confusing the characters that are lit up.  I read the manual and found that the characters could be made brighter, but even at the brightest setting I often found it very much a strain to read the numbers.  Yes I do have 64-year-old eyes now, but when I use my husband's old HP-11C I have no difficulty at all reading the numbers.  It is a totally different kind of display from this cheap sorry display they put on the HP-35S.  It is a disgrace.

964,"This is a satisfying all-in-one printer, scanner, and copier. I have no need for a fax machine, although it is a convenient feature to have available if it is ever needed. It has a good, but not great, build, but always works when I need it. Despite a few setup issues, I'm please with its performance.

There are three ways to connect this device -- USB, ethernet, and wireless. My preferred choice was wireless -- but it did not go well at all. In order to setup the wireless connection, you need to connect the device to a PC using the USB cable. After well over an hour -- possibly 90 minutes -- I only managed to connect it wirelessly to my router once. But after the printer went into ""sleep"" mode, it would not wake up on its own and the wireless connection was lost. After several failed attempted to reconnect it, I decided to use the ethernet option -- since the router was only four feet away! -- and have not looked back. The printer immediately obtained an IP address, and after two months, I have not experienced any issues with a drop or lack of connectivity, even after rebooting both the router and the printer. While wireless would have been convenient, it simply didn't work out for me.

The device comes with a software suite installation CD. Needless to say, the software is very fat -- and take a very long time to install. There's no option (from what I could tell) to install only the parts you need. For example, if you don't plan on using the fax features, the fax features of the software are still installed. The software itself remains fairly hidden on your PC when running, and provides the usual status updates regarding jobs. What is odd, however, is that you cannot adjust settings on the printer while connected via Wireless or Ethernet. You need to connect the printer via USB, or you need to adjust settings using the device's front-panel menus.

From a design perspective, the printer does not have a particularly solid build -- very lightweight plastic, especially on doors and panels. There is no paper-cassette, only a paper tray, so paper capacity is somewhat limited. This is, at best, a lightweight/light-job printer. The front panel keypad can be lifted out to an angle for easy viewing. While it has status lights to show current status, the LCD does not illuminate, which makes it difficult to view.

From a performance perspective, printing is what you would expect. Quality is good. Warm-up time from sleep-mode is very respectable. It prints a page fairly quickly. My only complain is related to ""paper out"": when the printer runs out of paper, it thinks there is a jam, and you need to open the upper doors to ""clear"" this error status. Scanning is also good. The default quality of scanning is 300 dpi, which can be increased to 600 dpi, and the printer scans in both b&w and color. A great feature is being able to scan to a PC -- which means you don't need to open any software on the PC. You select the PC destination using the front panel keypad, scan the document, and the document will be sent to the ""My Documents"" directory of the destination PC. This functionality is so easy, my wife figured it out without having to ask me how it works. Copying is good, and very handy. The device has autofeed, so if you have a multi-page document that needs to be scanned or copied, you can load the entire document and then scan or copy the entire thing.

From a user perspective, ""it always works"".

It is important to note that the toner supplied is only a short-duration toner cartridge -- it won't last long at all.

Better setup, a slightly better build, and a dedicated paper cartridge would make this good printer even better. Otherwise, it is a reliable networked printer that has not given me any trouble in over two months. If you need a multifunction device, this is recommended.",10,9.14184

This thing works great!

We placed the DVD inserts into the Cassette.  When a Disc is done writing, use the bundled Epson software to knock out a DVD image.  They have templates where you can pick a few pictures to put on the disc print, and they look great, even without the High Quality setting - which I haven't even used yet.

The Disc print feature moves the heads up a little, and you have to manually flip down the small head cover.  The first time you do this, the machine takes close to four minutes to move everything around.  I was worried that this was the normal process; but no.  From then on, the DVD Print changeover takes 5 seconds or so.

You do have to flip the DVD print cover back up when you are done with a Disc print, even if you are printing separate titles.  The software apparently needs to reset the hardware every single time.  If you are printing multiples of the same disc, of course you just put them in and hit Resume until you are done.

I would prefer the machine stay in Disc print mode until I am ready to print paper.  It doesn't make any sense to flip that cover up down up down up down if all I am doing all day is printing discs.  Maybe they will fix this with a software update.

I would recommend this pen, because of price, smooth ink flow, and over all design and feel.

I may need to find a better nib though.",33,7.0853615
989,"Just received this printer today and I was a little dissappointed that I can't use it as a wireless printer because my router is in my basement and my desk is on the first floor.  If I move the printer downstairs and set it next to the router, it works fine except for shooting out an extra page before printing an email.  It even prints fairly quickly, which I like.  I'd really like to give it at least 4 stars, but not if I have to have it wired to my laptop for it to work.  That's not why I bought a wireless printer.

When I had it set up as wireless, I tried printing a simple webpage and it took 15 minutes to print 3/4 of the page.  It took a couple of minutes to print the same page when it was sitting next to the router.  I can't even use the Printer Pro app to print a webpage either and my previous little, slow printing Epson would print using that app.  It was in the same exact spot as this Brother.

I'm keeping it because when it's wired, it prints quickly.  About 5 times faster than that little Epson and it wasn't a wireless.  But I'm still only giving it three stars because I want to let people know that it needs to be close to the router to work wirelessly and that when it does work, it prints quickly.  I checked and it will cost me $150 to move the Uverse router closer to the printer and I don't want that expense.  So for now, I'm using it as a wired-to-my-MacBook-Pro printer and it's back to not being able to print from my iPhone.",5,6.543339
990,"This all-in-one printer is quite advanced and can do many things, including printing on CDs. But it is not for the average user as its use is very complex. Besides, although the Users Guide covers 388 pages, the operating instructions are quite incomplete and partly wrong. No wonder, as some of the instructions etched on the input tray are in Chinese!

For instance I tried hard to load a #10 envelope on the rear input tray and although I chose Envelopes and Landscape on the Epson Print window, when I clicked Print on the Word document where the address was highlighted under Tools/Envelopes (as I did with my old Brother printer) this Epson flashed""Printing CD"" on its screen and the envelope came out either blank or crumpled blank.

So I emailed Epson Support and although their response was very fast, the instructions given in their email, obviously copied from an Epson source, were wrong and incomplete. After struggling with trial and error for a couple of hours, I managed to finally print one envelope but using different settings from the ones directed by Epson!

This is a fine printer, but the instructions do not do match its quality.",7,8.088235
991,"As USB flash drives become smaller, faster, higher capacity and cheaper I'm buying lots of them and using them for a variety of purposes.  With so many, I need to label them.  I started with round paper key tags, but they got scruffy too fast and didn't have enough room to write on.  So I looked for a better solution and am very happy to have found these.

o 8 colors, all nice, all easy to read the labels through, all balanced in tone with each other.  An uncommonly well done color selection.

o Sturdy, somewhat flexible plastic, should stand up well to extended use.

o The plastic loop to which the metal rings attach, which is a weak point in many plastic products, is strong:  grab the big ring with pliers and twist, and the small ring will twist open far before the plastic loop breaks.  It WILL break if you abuse it enough, but I don't envision these breaking in daily use.

o Grasp diagonally-opposite corners of a tag and twist:  the label compartment will pop open.  It hinges open on the side away from the rings.  I do not have enough experience yet to know whether this is likely to pop open in use.  E.g. when carried in pockets: will it twist open as things are jostled around?

o Nice (relatively) big rectangular paper label to write upon.  7/8"" x 1-7/8"" (44mm x 22mm). Of course you can use your own piece of paper if you wish :-).

o The large split ring is of good quality.  They aren't always.

o The small intermediate ring is strong, but not always perfectly closed where the ends meet.  This ring might turn out to be a weak spot, but it's too early to tell.  Definitely won't be a problem if you usually keep your keys (or flash drives, etc.) in a drawer or key cabinet.  Might eventually be a problem if you carry these in a pants pocket all the time with a bunch of other stuff.  I guess I'll find out.

o At only about 25 cents apiece these are far better than many key tags I've seen that cost a dollar or two apiece.",7,8.5124855

995,"I purchased this phone for my Mom who seems to have a way of killing cordless phones. Up until the Panasonic, the average life span for a cordless phone in her house was about 9 months. So far, with more than one year of use under her belt, she's still very pleased with how this phone works.

I'm especially fond of how easy it is to program numbers into the directory, since that task always falls to me. Very straightforward, and the directory makes speed dialing much easier for her.

Excellent sound quality and range. No interference from things such as microwaves, which was a problem with past phones.

My only quibbles are that after you program a number into one handset, you have to remember to transmit it to the others. It would be nice if it did that automatically. Also, the keys do not have back lighting, which can make it difficult to dial in low light conditions. But, the directory on the screen is very easy to see in any light, so there's a lesser need for a keypad light.

The batteries are easily replaceable at a low cost (standard AA rechargeable). Haven't had the need to do so yet, but it's nice to see that, unlike other phones, that the replacement batteries don't cost as much as the phone!

- the cutting edge does not handle even slightly thick paper such as glossy photo paper stock thickness.  It pushes the paper instead of cutting it

998,"This was almost my 2nd-favorite Cross model (after the Century II Selectip), but one little thing about it is just pathetic.

This model looks cool at first, until I noticed the weird gap on the body just above the pocket clip.  Normally when a pen has a pocket clip which emerges from the inside like this, the notch in the body is just deep enough to allow for the thickness of the clip, and the top piece seals flat against both the clip and body.

This pen looks as if the slot for the pocket clip was cut too deep, and the pocket clip is slid down too far leaving empty space above it.  But the silver tip is too narrow for the clip to be mounted any higher, so maybe they should have cut a groove inside the silver piece, or else made the silver tip start lower.  Whatever the solution, the designer of this pen should have been sent back to the drawing board to start again.

Aside from that manufacturing incompetence, the overall design of the pen is a perfect balance between classic Cross elegance and modern design.  It looks like some good artist sketched out this pen, then turned it over to an apathetic engineer.  Given the high price for a basic ballpoint made in China, there really isn't any reason why Cross couldn't have done a little better here.",4,7.999761

1000,"I use these pens for my coloring books and they are perfect!

They have nice bright colors and a decent variety of shades.  I do wish that the barrels showed the names of the colors, but they are easily chosen by the colors of the caps.  The colors are pretty true to the color of the cap, but I did notice that two of the light blues looks almost exactly the same when colored side by side.

The ink flows very smoothly and seem to last for a long time.  I've colored several pages and they are still working great.  I like that when I overlap the lines of color, they don't really show as long as the ink is still wet.  Hard to explain, but it's like when you color with a sharpie and you can see exactly where you overlap because the color gets just a little bit darker.  I haven't experienced that with these.

The ultra fine tips make it super easy to color in those tiny details in the books.

The triangle shaped barrel does make it nice to hold for long periods of time.  I was a bit skeptical of that, but I actually like it a lot.

All in all, they are kind of pricey for pens to use in coloring books, but I'm glad I paid for the more expensive pens and experience less frustration with the quality.  I love these and would definitely buy them again!",4,9.8958645

Indeed, there is no bottom hatch to dump in a ton of paperclips.  However, it's really not that hard to load it up--It took me less than 2 minutes to get 200 paperclips into this.

Despite what the other reviewer said, the magnet is not really that strong.  You can put this near a hard drive without a problem.  As an experiment, I put some data onto a hard disk, left the hard disk sitting on top of the clip holder for a day--no data loss.  Speaking as a guy who has worked in computer storage for some time, it takes some serious magnets to mess up a hard disk.

If you have the pencil holder in this collection, this paper clip holder is a little shorter and a little narrower.  It looks great with the other pieces of this set (I have the letter trays, a few pencil holders, the business card holder).

It is a small unit separate from the phone/tablet so it is easy to misplace, or for someone to run off with it.

The problem is that it is hard to keep it working.  It has one button and one set of LEDs that either flash yellow, red or green in unison.  So - you just keep holding and clicking the button until it connects and it works for a while.  But, if it sits too long between transactions it un-links from the phone and nothing seems to get it to re-link.  I'm guessing it has something to do with saving battery.

The pictures from this printer are EVERY BIT AS GOOD as the ones from the photo shop!  The colors are true and vivid, and the images are crisp.  (I used a 7.1 megapixel digital camera.)  Even the photos of Neuschwanstein in the rain and fog, along with several rather dark photos of church interiors, turned out well.

Since the ink cartridge that comes with the printer lasts far longer than the small paper pack that comes with it, I highly recommend buying the 2-pack ink and 270-sheet paper pack -- the extra 70 sheets of paper helps even out the ink and paper usage, which is important since you can only buy the ink and paper together.

My only complaints about this printer (and neither is bothersome enough to deduct a rating star for) is that 1) for some reason I had to clean and realign the heads after only 10 photos -- suddenly the 11th photo was streaked and the 12th photo was TERRIBLE, and 2) there is no easy way to shift your photo image even slightly to center an image when using the decorative (mostly Disney) borders.

I returned this mouse pad because of the stupid sticky surface on the bottom. I am now buying a rubber bottom one.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

It has a VERY GOOD texture on it for a laser mouse to move on (so it slides around easily). But the only downside is that it comes with this sticky tap-like bottom on the underside of the pad, and so if you take off the protective paper to expose the stickyness, it eventually loses its stickyness and it also picks up dirt from the desk. If you decide to keep the paper over the stickyness then it slides around to much and is hard to work with..

I work at a school with three classrooms, and two of them had Exacto Sharpeners (one school pro, the other XLR).  I figured I'd continue the tradition in my room by purchasing yet another Exacto brand sharpener.  (Formerly,  we had a school pro in it but it broke).

The first one sent to me didn't power on, but this one does...and boy does it.  It's audibly powerful.  Like,  noisy as heck, in part because it rattles on the wooden bookshelf it sits on.  I'm thinking of placing it on a mouse pad to see if it dampens the sound.

Even after the pencil is pulled from the unit,  you can hear the grinder spinning.

But, hey, it produced a mighty fine pointed pencil tip...after a bit of finessing.  You have to insert it just enough (but not too much)  in order to sharpen, and you have to rotate it in order to get all sides.",2,9.724937

1038,"I was eager to try out this scanner.  Several years ago we bought a Canonscan 9950F to convert all our film into digital.  At that time I converted 12,000 negatives into digital format.  Since then I have used my Canonscan mainly as a flatbed scanner, although occasionally I need to convert a few negatives, for other people or when we use a disposable camera.

I set it up on a Dell Dimension 8100 on an external powered usb port.  No problems with installation, I was up and running in under 10 minutes.

To compare I took a new set of negatives and scanned 6 shots in both the Canonscan and the Epson both at the same resolution and using the dust and scratch removal programs for both.  Here are my comparisons

The Canonscan is faster, it took about 7 minutes to scan the 6 shots.
The Epson took a little longer, 9 minutes for 6 shots.  The quality of the Epson was better, dust removal was more precise and the Epson software was better able to pick up where the edges of a very light photo were than the Canon.  I wonder if the LED, (being one wavelength) helps with this clarity.

However, the Epson only has 2 slots for putting your negatives into on the plastic mask.  Theoretically it can hold 12 images, but that is only if that is how your negatives are cut.
If your negatives have, say, 5 images each, you are only going to be able to do 10 a time unless you are willing to cut up the negatives.

The Canonscan mask has 5 slots, each for 6 negatives.  In theory you could do 30,  but I found that because of how the negatives were cut I could usually do 24 to 28.

Not an issue if you are just doing a few, but if you have a backlog of thousands it can make a real difference in how long the project would take.  The scan time is not hugely different but the time involved in physically placing the negatives into the slots and setting up the scan would take longer with the Epson.  The mask with the Epson is more difficult to work with than the Canon mask.  The Canon has a hinge on one side, the Epson the whole front snaps out.  It seems a bit flimsy, but so did the Canon and it lasted through the 12,000 scans.

I really like the LED instant on being the impatient person that I am.  You do not have to wait for the scanner to warm up, great for a quicker scanning of a couple documents.

The Epson is much more intuitive.  It took me about 10 minutes to figure out how to scan a negative (I, too, made the error of not putting the mask in the correct place).  With the Canon I remember it taking me an hour to get the general idea and a couple hours to figure out exactly how to get it to do what I wanted.

I also could not get the front buttons to work, but you can do it all from the software.  Being able to scan to a PDF is really nice.",19,14.5344715
1039,"As a professional artist, I've been using Prismacolor's Premier line of pencils exclusively since I started working on my BFA degree. All of my professors required them, and definitely for good reason. They are not, however, the best pencil choice for beginners. All of the negative reviews I've read seem to be from those who are new to drawing and are frustrated with broken tips, the core falling out, etc. If used properly, none of those things will happen.

My humble advice from my own experience is this: buying these pencils before learning proper blending techniques and the ideal amount of pressure will result in heavy-handed drawing and considerable frustration from broken tips. It's kind of like buying a $100k sports car to use while learning how to drive. Prismacolor's line of Scholar colored pencils are definitely the way to go if you're just starting out. Or, better yet, just buy a super cheap hard-tipped pencil set to have fun with and learn with. And then, once you've mastered the basics, proceed with buying an expensive, soft-core brand.

Learning how to use colored pencils without pressing too hard, etc., is only half the equation, though. The other technique to master is how best to sharpen these pencils. Without the right sharpener, you'll end up with weak tips that'll break with even the softest pressure, and even more frustrating, you'll lose large chunks of lead by stripping the wood and thus loosening the seal between the core and shell. From my experience, there is a German company that makes a sharpener that is extremely inexpensive and yet performs even better than the one made by Prismacolor. It's made out of wood and the blade is extremely sharp, so you'll get really great tips that won't break when used correctly. Electric sharpeners will absolutely churn these pencils up and should avoided unless you're using a brand of pencils with an extremely hard core. Lastly, use a regular lead pencil before sharpening your first colored pencil of the day. This will clean out any residual wax, making it less likely that your tips will sharpen unevenly.

The final piece of advice for those who're frustrated with broken tips is this: after sharpening, put the tip of the pencil on your paper (watch that it's perfectly vertical) and press down. You'll need to use the right amount of pressure since too little will have no effect and too much will break the tip. However, when done correctly, it will compress the lead just enough to make the tip stronger and less likely to break.

All-in-all, once you're ready to get stunning results after learning the ropes on a cheaper set, Prismacolor truly is the best choice. They are such a blast to use, because they allow total control over color saturation and blend flawlessly for a stunning end result. Just keep in mind that if you purchased these and are new to the craft, patience and persistence are key. Focus on how hard you're pressing, especially when holding the pencil at a sharper angle, and don't underestimate how important the right sharpener and sharpening technique are when using a professional-grade colored pencil. :)

Good luck and have fun! :)",10,14.493548

Although the product works well, there are some minor issues.  It does tend to jam, even when one does not place too many pages of documents into the shredder, and that can be mildly annoying.  Also, when emptying the shredded remnants, sometimes they don't flow easily into the garbage bag and one has to pick up some of the shredding from the floor.

This kit is fairly comprehensive, especially for addressing those checklists schools/teachers provide to kids. Amazing how this is a relatively new phenomenon (when I was in school, the school had most of the supplies you needed), but regardless, this is the realm of school in our time.

Is the price worth it? If you were to buy these individually, you'd pay more, so there's your answer. For the brand names and the all-in-one ease and reduced price, this is a very solid deal. Get a head start now and get it out of the way before you head away for the summer!",7,7.1973834

1046,"I bought a set of these blue light filters as well as the ""white"" (really, off-white) ones. I work in a government office with the typical harsh fluorescent lights. Yet even though ours are high up (20 feet or so), the light still bothered me and my office mates, creating a sterile environment. I had originally wanted to get the fancy light diffusers with clouds printed on them. I was blocked by two reasons: those are incredibly expensive (this was coming out of my pocket) and the fixtures in our office are ""open""; that is, they have open ""louvers"", not a hinged cover where I could replace the plastic with something else.

My office mates and I have mixed opinions of these. The worst of the observations is that, in bulk, they reduce the amount of light rather significantly (the blue more than the white). But the reduced glare and harshness seem to more than make up for it. There's also split opinion on whether the white or blue is better. I think it comes down to personal preference. I like them both equally. Many, including myself, have noted that the blue version makes it seem as though we have skylights - for an interior office with no windows, at least we have a fake perception of the outdoors! :)

The reason I knocked off a star is because I didn't realize when I bought them that there was no frame. That is, it's just a folded piece of nylon with six (not 4 as described) magnets sewn into the border. This made putting them up (again, up to a 20 foot ceiling) rather difficult without a ladder (didn't want to notify facilities that we were putting up non-approved light covers!). It was doable, but a challenge, especially with the side magnets constantly wanting to stick to one another. Having even a modest frame to keep the rigidity of the fabric would be preferable.

While you can notice the fold lines once installed, it's not really a problem. And the filtered light helps me focus and has reduced my eyestrain and headaches.",7,8.857303

No shocker, then, that Ooma effectively refuses to reactive used units.

I am using this one in my home office as an office organizer for things like extra pens, ""sticky notes"", scissors, paperclips, etc. My stapler even fits so storing all that in an organizer like this really cleans up the desk as well as keeps all those types of things in their place. I like having paperclips, binder clips, rubber bands in the top and less-used or needed items in the bottom. For me the drawer fits quite nicely. The desk drawer I am using it is  15X12X2 1/8. The actual top of the organizer is the stated dimensions, though the bottom is slightly slimmer; about 10.25X14.

Let me describe what you get, and then what I wish was different:

What you get is a purple notebook with a design in lighter purple on it.  On the outside there is a metal plate with a paper insert where you can write the child's name.  There is also a a place on the cover to add a name.
--the purple cover is sturdy (cardboard?) but it's purple.  Why purple?  Why not a range of colors?  Purple?
--the side area to write a name is too small.  At least to small for my scribbles.
--a plastic or plasticized cover would have been nice. Surely I'm not the only person who spills their coffee.

Inside there are fairly sturdy pockets  - one for each year.
These pockets are labeled with the year.  There is a place for a large photo to be glued on.  A place to list the school, teacher, nickname, age, height and weight --on the front.  On the back there are larger areas to labeled: Current Events, Friends, milestones, and signature.

-- Too Small.  This is my main complaint.  Not really that the pockets are too small, but that because they are in a spiral there is no way to add additional pockets or things like artwork or medical records.  How cool would it be if you could use this notebook for more than just school photos and report cards.  If it was like a regular notebook, you could add plastic sleeves and keep artwork your child made that year; or you could buy other pockets to hold additional info, like shot records.

After a few hours of frustration it completely stopped working. I know that my review made it to the company because I received a message from them in broken English stating that ""I am so sorry for this, and i wil replacement, can you withdraw the feedback? Thank you."" I have yet to receive a replacement not that I wanted one anyway, nor did I remove my feedback. The next day they sent another message ""Warm tips:  please be sure to insert the usb cable with your devices interface well when using the scanner. Thank youI reflect your problem to technical staff, they think may be you do not interface well. "" They then went on to tell me how to properly interface. I am shocked by their customer service, the person handling customer feedback should be able to properly write in the language that is used. Second of all, I know how to properly interface, its not my fault that this is a crappy scanner. I recommend spending a little more money for a more quality product.

1082,"Even though it is a ""professional"" pencil sharpener, the size of this Bostitch is surprising. It is quite large, which means that the reservoir for shavings is a very good size, but it also means that storing this sharpener in a drawer or cubby is not easy.

This sharpener has the ability to sharpen many different sized pencils. There is a rotary wheel on the front, which can be turned to align the proper size hole with the sharpening mechanism. At first it was difficult to determine which hole was for a regular number 2 size pencil, but there is an arrow pointing to it. Unfortunately the arrow is black, as is the background that it's on, which made it difficult to see. Most household or children's drawing pencils are number 2. Therefore, most of the other sizes will go unused, though when they're needed they will surely come in handy.

The ability of this sharpener to actually sharpen a pencil is a bit underwhelming. I had one pencil that was unevenly sharpened, and this sharpener did not do much to help remedy that problem.  The rotary wheel feels cheap, and it has a tendency to move during the sharpening process.

Removing the shavings reservoir was easy enough, but replacing it proved to be a cumbersome task. It took several minutes, and the directions were not of any help. Given that the reservoir is so large, it will only need to be emptied infrequently, but shavings were scattered everywhere while trying unsuccessfully to insert the reservoir back into the mechanism.

This sharpener is probably overkill for home use, but it may not be sturdy enough for heavy classroom use. Its greatest utility would be for sharpening pencils that are not the standard number 2.",2,12.603533

1086,"Bad news and then good news.  I bought this on a Sunday:  LCD panel was in Japanese. Directions in the box require you to read Japanese to change the language setting!  Really.  No answer to this on web tech support. [And there won't be, either, they told me later.] To find the tech phone number, you must go to web first.  Phone support not available on Sunday night. We needed it for homework due Monday.  Software to register on the internet did not find internet, even though there was a cable link that was working fine. [This was because the unit firmware thought it was a Japanese version, I found out later.]  The drivers would not install.  Tried twice on a win xp computer.  [This is because the drivers were for the U.S. version, but the firmware was set for the Japanese version of the unit, as I found out later.]

My initial impression on Sunday May 22, 2005:  might print nicely, I would not know.  I would not give it any stars for tech support.  installation software stinks.  big $300 paperweight wasting my time.  [That's when I gave it a one-star rating.]

The next morning, I called tech support and they were very helpful.  Told me how to switch it to English.  (It's not possible without tech support.) Then the drivers installed and it could register itself on the internet.  It does print nicely and is quiet (as compared to the Epson C82 that it replaced, which was loud).  Copies in color (a bit faded, but OK.) and black and white.  Starts printing in a reasobable time. Prints photos beautifully, much better than the Epson C82.

Scans nicely, but the scanner driver always resets to the defaults, so I have to tell it to use the doc feeder every time. Scanner driver comes up slowly and realy slows the process.  (I also use HP 3330 and Fujitsu ScanSnap scanners, and the Fujitsu has the best driver by far.)  This Canon unit replaced an Epson scanner 1640 SU.  The Canon makes a better image, but has a less functional driver.  The sheet feeder does not hang up or grab too many pages, which were problems with the Epson stand-alone scanner.

Initialy the Canon fax function did not work with the touch tone phone line and phone company voice mail.  Called tech support again and they said to sign up for a ""distinctive ring"" with the phone company. Did that online.  But had to call the phone company (Verizon) to get the new number for the ""distinctive ring."" (It might have taken another call to tech support to set up the fax after the disctinctive ring was set up with the phone company.) That done, the fax works very well on a single line with the ""distinctive ring."" Just like a second line, but you can't talk when a fax is sending or receiving.

I would buy the Canon MP780 again ... but not on a night that I needed to use it.  It took one tech support call to be useable at all and a second call to get the fax to work on the voice phone line.  I would change my star rating to 4 stars if I could.

1090,"I bought these wax crayons to use with encaustic painting. They were recommended by a teacher because they work so well on the wax paintings to make highlights and fill in lines etched in the wax for the purpose of filling the scratches in with color. The price was really good since it was higher at most of the on-line art stores I shop. It might be because the company is changing the box the crayons come in as one site had a new style of box in their ad. These wood covered wax crayons are called ""3 in 1"" because they are water soluble so they can be used for water color painting, wax based so they can be used as regular crayons (but kind of pricey for that use), and can be sharpened like a colored pencil and used like one (again--a little pricey for that). To use as a water color crayon you can either draw a line of wax inside the outline but near the outside of the item you want to color, then dampen a paint brush and brush it over the wax to liquefy it and draw color into the picture. The color will be darker near the outline and shade to a lighter color toward the center making a very pretty effect. You can also scribble a bit of the was onto a piece of plastic like an old flat container lid, dampen a brush and stroke it over the spot of color to liquefy it, then paint with the color like ordinary water color paint. You can also color over the surface of a rubber stamp, lightly spritz with water, let the water set on the stamp for a few seconds to liquefy the color, then stamp on card stock for a paint brush effect. Stamps with large flat surfaces work best for this since tiny details won't stamp well with this method. In my opinion, using these crayons in water color painting and on rubber stamps are the best uses for these crayons. Since I am new to encaustic painting I haven't tried them on wax yet, but the video where they were used on wax made it look very simple.",2,10.075988

I'm a homeschooler and we school in a small 10x10 room with a 4'x6' white board and the dry erase markers can really stink up the room quickly. I had originally gotten EXPO's low odor dry erase markers and after a week of use I kept wondering why there was constant ghosting (marks left after erasing, can only be removed with cleaner) on my white board. I was constantly having to pull out my cleaner and clean between lessons. Very annoying and time wasting! I'm sure other moms/teachers can relate! But yet I noticed that when we used the two D.E. markers my girls picked out from the individual bins at Staples, they never left ghosting (pink and blue-green colors, their favorites). The brand was Quartet EnduraGlide.

Well as a homeschooler, we have several different types/brands/sizes of white boards to use, including the special lined ones (both cheap dollar bin brands and Lakeshore Learning Store brand) that we use for writing practice. I took one of EXPO markers (I had both chisel and fine point) and one of the Quartet markers and wrote the same word on all out boards. Waited a minute (drying time) and when I went to erase, to my surprise, on all my white boards the EXPO never came off completely! I read online that it was the low odor in EXPO that causes it, so I assumed Quartet's markers were not low odor. However I went back to Staples and learned that Quartet were in fact low odor! I have since returned all my EXPO sets I purchased on Amazon and switched them out for Quartet. I will never regret this choice.",20,14.532578

1093,"I replaced my plastic Fellows keyboard with this model.  It's well built and easy to install *IF* you have a flat surface to mount the rails on.  If like me, you have a metal brace/beam running under your desk, some surgery is required.  I cut some 2X4's to provide a flat surface to mount the rails.  Not a huge ordeal, but something to be aware of.  One additional note, you have to turn the knob to loosen the keyboard tray to adjust it (angling it up or down).  If you keep the keyboard low enough, you can push it under the desk w/o having to loosening the knob.  However, if you keep the keyboard tray elevated, it won't slide back since the keyboard tray will be higher than the rails.  So if you're used to keyboard trays that slide in and out, it's something to be aware of.

Interesting thing about it, is that ink within the threaded portion of the pen are normal ( feeds to the nib), but at the base of the grip it is NOT, though if you mess things up a bit like I did in the beginning, you can wind up with ink in the pen tube, but not feeding to the nib.

1103,"I bought this little fax/copy/scanner about a month ago for light-to-medium home/office use.  I've been pretty happy with it, overall, with some reservations.

Pros:
1. Very good copy and print quality.  (Haven't used the scanner)
2. Moderately fast print/copy speed.
3. Variety of print settings to allow you to print fast/draft, fast/normal, normal, best, and maximum dpi.  You can also choose greyscale and ""black cartridge only.""  Given the price of color cartridges, I use the latter setting most often.
4. Easy to learn.  The manual is good, and use is pretty intuitive (mostly).
5. The size is great -- it fits on top of a small bookshelf, with all the features of much bigger units.

Cons:
1. While mostly intuitive, use is not COMPLETELY intuitive.  To print some custom-size invitations, for example, I learned by trial and error that you need to change the settings in TWO places:  in the document's printer properties settings (through Word, in my case) and through the printer's own settings, through the print manager.  Very strange way to do it, I thought.
2. The in/out paper slot on the printer is the same.  That is, it takes paper up, prints on it, and spits it out on top of the ""in"" tray.  It doesn't re-use printed pages, but this isn't the most convenient arrangement for monitoring paper level or even grabbing finished documents.
3. The paper ejection is often too powerful, especially in Fast/Draft.  This results in the finished document's being scattered all over the floor -- very annoying.
4.  Cancelling print jobs often requires restarting the computer to clear the memory -- although this could be a Windows bug.  I mean, an ""undocumented feature.""
5. Cartridges are pricey.  The HP site (only place I looked) listed black cartridges for over $20 and color for more than $30.

Overall, it's a decent machine that could use some retooling to improve functionality.  If you're just going for quality and price (and size!), and you have low to moderate volume print/copy requirements, you'll probably be very pleased.  I'll probably live with the annoyances of this unit, given my light print/copy needs.  If I printed/copied more often, I'd return this machine for something better engineered.

One special note:  I purchased this printer through Amazon's partner program from Circuit City.  When I went to pick it up, the store had lost the order, even though I had an order number.  The staff was incredibly rude and unhelpful.  I finally bought it off the floor and had to call to cancel the original order (for which I'd already been charged!).  Given Amazon's own excellent customer service, free shipping, and fair return policy, I wish I'd just waited the week it would have taken for Amazon to ship it to me directly.  I won't make that mistake again.

Update October 2008:  This machine is still working fine, and I remain pleased with it (with the above caveats).  I still haven't figured out how to stop it from spitting paper all over the floor, and I'd prefer a double-sided option -- but I'm happy it's still going five years later!",148,14.508309

1106,"You should be aware that this printer has a serious ""ink low"" behavior. When any ink cartridge is getting low (which still means a lot of ink left by the way), it changes the Fax reception model. Instead of printing your faxes as they arrive, it dumps them into memory. So, even though yellow (say) is low, it will not print your B&W fax!
It takes more than 5 steps to print the fax and delete it (menu, scroll to memory item, ok, scroll to print, OK document, scroll to print all pages, ok, menu to go up, scroll to delete, ok to delete, ok to delete, menu to get out).
Worse, after a couple of these, the memory is mixed up. So, when you want to send a Fax, it will say ""memory full"" even though the memory is empty. You then have to power cycle the printer (hold down on/off for 1 second, wait 10 seconds, power on, wait for it to get ready (another 10-20 seconds).
This means you either have to waste ink by throwing out cartridges before they are empty, or you have to deal with this mess. Canon says there is no workaround or fix for this.
There are 3 other problems with copying you should know before you buy (I wish I did):
1. You cannot use the Auto Document Feeder (sheet feeder) when copying or scanning with any setting in auto (exposure, size, etc). It does not make any of that clear, so if you find it refuses the auto doc feeder, reset everything to manual :-(
2. Black duplex printing uses color cartridges for one of the sides, so uses the more expensive ink. That is, it does not use the blank ink for both sides.
3. Copying speeds are much slower than the blurb implies. If you make 10 copies of one page, it is as fast as they say. If you copy multiple pages, each one takes much much longer, does the scan, and then does the print. Also, if any setting is in auto mode, it does a two pass scan (one to check the page), and that takes a really long time.",306,11.904398
1107,"I was a little hesitant purchasing this system for a new conference room because of SIP compatibility. However, I am glad that I did. We have an Allworxs SIP, and adding this phone to the existing system was no different than adding a regular IP handset. Although this phone comes with zero instructions whatsoever, there are a lot of websites with guides on how to set this up with your current set-up. Everything on the sound station works on our allworxs system (transfer, hold, and extension dialing) except the clock and I believe answering parked calls. I haven't found a way to manually set the time and it just isn't contacting the servers correctly. So I just gave up and disabled the clock...  Lastly, the microphone and speaker clarity are unbelievable; it is sitting in the center of a 18' conference table and it can pick up voices of people sitting on either end. I did end up getting extension microphones to help with echo. The echo is more of our conference room design than phone design.

Overall I rate this phone 4/5 with a one star deduction from lack of instructions. I understand they can not include instructions to accommodate every SIP system out there.

So, now that I've owned this multipen, and a different brand, for just over two months, I can accurately speak to Cross's superior craftsmanship, and this pen's undisputable functionality. I'd bought a pair of the same multipen made by a different company, and the value of those pens was stated as being around thirty bucks. Well, after owning each of those for a short week, I quickly became aware of why they were being sold for a measly ten bucks. Even though those pens had more of the heft I'd originally said I preferred, the cheap things broke after being dropped ONCE from a height of less than three feet! With my Cross multipen, I'm still receiving compliments on it, it's still my favorite, and even though I've dropped it more than once, the metal barrel and shaft on it make for a much more durable pen than the ones I've come across from other brands.

So, there you have it! If you're in the market for a stylish, elegant, and durable multi-pen, you're looking at your best bet!

Of course, I know that this pen beats his dimestore version hands DOWN - this Cross Tech 3 is a quality writing instrument, and elegant enough for ANY professional)! Wonder if it's too late to change that rating to five stars...

Since receiving my pen from Amazon (in two business days yet, and for FREE! Amazon Prime ROCKS!), I'm considering buying another one, this time in the black finish, if I don't end up deciding that another chrome is a MUST have as a back-up... If only they made it in a polished copper color....

As for my refills, I got my order from [...] a prompt five days after it was mailed via first class US Postal Service, and am thrilled with the leads and ink refills I bought from them. They're a perfect fit, and offered in colors beyond the standard red and black, right up my artsy alley! Good stuff!

When it comes time for me to buy gifts for close friends, this pen is going to go to the top of my ""ideas"" list. I can't imagine anyone not finding this pen as enticing and useful as I've found it! It's like the old American Express ads: I never leave home without this pen! It's also reawakened my desire to draw during my free time! What a versatile, snazzy pen! Everyone should have one of these!

  ~+~

So far, I'm very pleased with this pen. It's sleek and slender, contrary to what I was expecting, as the photo makes it look potentially bulky. Changing between the black ink tip, red ink tip, and lead tip is smooth and easy, only requiring a simple twist of the pen's barrel in either direction. Changing out the refills is also easy, simply requiring that you pull up firmly on the (rather short) pen tip refills to remove them and push in the new pen refill. For the pencil, you simply pull the lead-loading mechanism out, and insert no more than three .5mm lead refills. The end cap of the pen unscrews (rather than pulls off - a smart touch) to reveal the pencil eraser.

As far as refills go, I've only recently ordered ink pen refills, eraser refills, and leads (since they have the softer 3B lead hardness that I prefer; the standard #2 pencil is a 2B hardness) [...] who offers free first class shipping on all refills, excluding bottled fountain pen ink), and I'm expecting these to fit the pen just fine, especially since Levenger previously carried this very same pen, and Pen City showed the pen itself on the same page with the refill items that I ordered.

Overall, I'm thrilled with my pen so far - I just got it today, so I can't speak to overall functionality yet, but so far it looks like a very pleasing piece. The only reason for my rating it four stars as opposed to five, is that I would have liked the pen to have just a little more heft. At just over twenty grams, or just under one ounce, it seems to be an okay weight, but I suppose I simply like a heavier pen as it makes me feel as if I'm really getting a solid, high quality writing instrument. This one appears to be high quality, even if it doesn't have the heft that I prefer.... Only time will tell.

If you're considering this, it's definitely the best deal that you'll find for an elegant-looking 3-in-1 pen. I've searched the web from top to bottom to see what multi-pens are available out there, and the others are either clunky, sporty-looking, or more expensive than this elegant, tapered number. I'm positive that you won't regret deciding on this one!",36,13.930825
1112,"Very pleasantly surprised to find that this Lamy Safari performs so well for such a low price. Mildly irritated that it didn't come with a converter. This is mentioned in the text on the page from which I ordered the pen, but I missed it.

The nib is a very attractive black metal which is more flexible than my Montblanc Diplomat medium point, or Cross medium point, or Sheaffer fine point, which makes it fun to write and draw with. The nib is exceptionally smooth. Its flexibility gives variable line width while writing which gives character and individuality to one's handwriting and makes drawings different from -- some say better than -- from those done with rolling writers and ballpoints.

As the ink in the converter diminishes, the ink flow decreases causing an increase in friction as the nib moves across the surface of the paper.  The pen was supplied with one ink cartridge. I thought it was a converter and tried to fill the pen. Others have mentioned its similarity to a converter in appearance. After only a page of writing, the ink flow became unsatisfactory, with the nib dragging and skipping. The cartridge would not yield to my efforts to squeeze it to increase ink flow. When the converter arrived, I was able to twist the pump handle on the converter to improve ink flow, though this method is not without risk of ink blotches destroying your latest production.

The pen grip area may be an intentionally ergonomic design. It is more comfortable to use than my round pens.

This model is shown here and there on the Internet as being suitable for filling the barrel with ink by means of an eyedropper (after being sure to apply silicon grease to the barrel threads), resulting in a large ink reservoir, something which might forestall if not prevent periodic ink-flow problems.

Keep in mind that this pen is offered at various prices depending on the color. A pretty color can turn this $20 pen into a nearly $40 pen.",2,7.7902994

1118,"I have ordered a few of these cartridges and two of Black cartridges started leaving big streaks on the printouts. Some work fine while lately the cartridges have not been so good.  Don't know if it is a quality control issue or over fill issue.  One cartridge lasted about a week before the streaks made it unusable to use. The latest one streaks occasionally.  Have not had any problems with the Color Cartridges; but then again I don't use that much color ink.  I have also used the 60XL cartridges from this vendor on another printer and had one go bad immediately, otherwise the others seem OK.  I kind of expect these cartridges to sometimes fail.  I don't have the time or inclination to send them back for replacements but if this continues I will start doing that, if the failure rate increases.  All in all the refurbished cartridges are better and cheaper than buying new HP cartridges.  I have only used refurbished ink cartridges for about 10 years now.  One of my favorite vendors stopped making the cartridges I use, so I tried this vendor. I never had a failure from the other vendor.

1129,I've had shredders a long time and chose this one as the other one had a malfunctioning electrical cord. It was also extremely loud. I looked around on Amazon and saw this one. It was a bit more than I wanted to pay but I use a shredder quite a bit for personal security. Nothing with an address gets out of my place without being shredded. It's easy to use and the instructions were very clear. The basket can really hold a great deal of paper because of the micro-cut. They're really small pieces so there's no way anyone could see anything. As for credit cards not sure yet how I feel about it. I did shred 2 of them but one at a time. It was a bit rough on the shredder so I won't be doing that much. It's much quieter than the other too which is a real asset in an apartment. The one thing I stress is use shredder oil as directed on a regular basis or extra as you need it. I use Fellowes Power Shredder Oil and Amazon has it.  It'll keep the blades sharp and the shredder running smoothly. Very important. The blades are super sharp so be careful.  I didn't use 12 sheets at a time at most 5 and it worked great. It has casters so you can move it around which I really like. It glides nicely but you'll have to give it a little lift up over surfaces that aren't flat. Not a problem. Sticky stuff like postal labels will shred but it will some of it will stick to the blades so you have to remove it by hand after you power it off. Do it with great care so you won't cut your hand.

1131,"From the picture and the price, one might think this could be a low-end or cheap product.  But having purchased it and receiving this zipper padfolio having it in-hand, it far exceeds my expectations and looks to be a $40-$50 item.  I paid $15.99, and it is a steal.  It looks very professional.  The construction is solid, clean and sharp.  Don't dismiss this product because you do not recognize the brand.  I never heard of Samsill before.  But, it looks like it was made by a higher-end brand name.  It is not super fine high-end feeling leather or anything, but it looks very nice and serves its purpose very well and gives you a professional look for sure.  It is made of Nappa Leather.

Plenty of room to slide your tablet into the soft-lined interior tablet pocket.  Comes with the pictured full pad letter-size 8.5"" x 11"" writing pad.  It does not come with a pen, but it does have a pen holder where you can place your own pen.

I have had the machine since 5/2008 and it works great. I would add to my original review that there is an excellent feature where it will ask you after scanning a series of pages if you want to continue scanning. This is great because it allows you to scan a single set of documents of any size, despite the feeder only taking 50 pages at a time.

I also noticed the price is now $900?? Truly ludicrous. I know there is a new machine replacing the S510, the S5100 at $400 and there is an Epson model around the same price. I would stay with Fujitsu and buy the S5100 if I were buying a scanner at this time.

Original Comments:
I have had the scanner going on 24 hours and it works well.  I was using a very slow all-in-one HP machine.  The scansnap does in 3 minutes what took my HP over 90 minutes.

The scansnap software was easy to install but the ABBYY software will not install on my computer.  I keep getting an error code. The scanner comes with a ful version of Adobe Acrobat. This adds a lot of value to this purchase!

I scan loan packages which saves me a lot of money, and time on next day air.  I have already scanned 2 full packages, 85 pages each and it works great.  If you are concerned about the 50 page doc feeder being too small, not to worry as the software will allow you to bundle your larger scans into one single file.

If you are e-mailing large files, you will need to use a file service such as [...].  These services work very well, are secure and password protected.

There just isn't any comparison between a scan and a fax document.  The scan comes out nearly as good as the original.  You know how faxes look and print.  Also, sending an e-mail to multiple recipients is much easier than faxing.  While toll charges for faxing inside the US might be cheap, calling internationally might not be.  Lastly, you will save paper scanning versus faxing. My fax machine has become obsolete.  I receive my faxes with [...] and e-mail all replies.

In summary, this is a good machine, probably the best in its price range.  Frankly, I think the price could be much lower and I suspect it will be in the future.

1150,"I have been using the Pilot Metropolitan fountain pen for a few weeks now. I have really enjoyed writing with this pen. Let me tell you some of the Pros and Cons I encountered while using this pen.

Pros:

Smooth ink flow while writing: The Metropolitan flowed smoothly no matter how fast or slow I wrote, when drawing lines, doodling, whatever. The flow was consistent, never heavier or thinner.

Ink dries quickly: This is a function both of appropriate ink flow, and the quality of the ink. I have used fountain pens that put down so much ink, you have to wait and wait ... and be very careful ... not to smear writing because the words were not dry. The Metropolitan put down only as much ink as was needed, and the ink dried almost instantly.

Metal body: The matte black finish is applied to a brass barrel. Accents are chrome and the nib is stainless steel. The only part I'm not sure about is the part you grasp, that holds the nib. It is shiny and appears to be plastic. It is not a portion that bears any great stress though, so this should not limit its longevity.

Very smooth strokes: The nib on the pen I received is marked as ""medium,"" but to me it seemed fine/medium. The strokes are very smooth. I found it did not snag or tear even cheap office copier paper.

Great value: For this quality of pen, the price is very reasonable. Truthfully, as a writing implement, it is better than my Mont Blanc pen (not a super premium fountain pen, but easily 5x the cost of the Metropolitan). The cartridges are a reasonable price too. I ordered the Pilot Namiki cartridges from Amazon as refills. (Blue black. Love me some blue black.)

Water resistant ink: I poured some water on the page. The ink will smear somewhat if you let the paper absorb the water, but it did not blob. Text was still readable. If you blot spills immediately, there is almost no smearing.

Tends to stay primed: Gravity is going to work against any fountain pen that is stored upright. Eventually the ink in the nib will dry and drain back into the cartridge or reservoir. I found the Pilot Metropolitan stayed primed any time the pen was stored horizontally, and even for about 4 days if stored nib upwards. It's nice when the pen writes immediately upon being uncapped. Cheaper fountain pens might leak if stored horizontally, but that has not happened with the Metropolitan.

Lightweight and comfortable to hold: I found the Metropolitan looked a bit chubby, but it is very lightweight and it is comfortable to hold while writing.

Cons:

No good for any sort of multi-part forms: These days, one rarely comes across multi-part forms any more, such as NCR paper or even (yes, it STILL exists) carbon paper forms. If you use them on a regular basis, this is not the pen to use on those forms. Not that it can't apply enough pressure to produce copies ... it's just a quick way to ruin the pen's nib. Best to stick with ballpoint or rollerballs for those forms.

Ink cartridges are proprietary: I have not tried alternative cartridges, but I can see from the shape of the ones I received that the Shaeffer and Parker cartridges will not fit it. (Of course, Pilot cartridges will not fit their pens either.) The point is, of course, that you want to make sure you have spares of the necessary cartridge, since you can't use just any old refill to stick in the Metropolitan.

Not good for folks who bear down while writing: Using a fountain pen is for people who write with a light to average stroke, not people who really bear down on the paper.

Ink tends to blot if you hold the nib to paper: Ink has to be thin enough to flow easily through the nib and dry quickly, but the downside is that cheaper paper tends to draw that ink into its fibers a little more quickly.

No instructions: How hard can it be? Well, cartridges have 2 ends that are different ... which end do you insert? The converter for bottle ink ... how do you fill and use that? I'm sure the answers can be found ... out there ... somewhere ... but wouldn't it be nice for Pilot to include a simple, one page set of instructions, or even the link to where they can be found on the web? (Yes, it would be nice.)

Bottom Line:

I found the Pilot Metropolitan to be a surprise; I had not expected this inexpensive pen to write as nicely as it did. The low cost of pen and refills are a few of its Pros, as well as smooth flowing, fast drying ink, and very smooth stroke, metal body and accents, light weight and comfortable shape, and water resistant ink. It also writes whenever you pick it up, unless you've stored it with the nib upright for more than 4-5 days. On the downside, the Metropolitan suffers from the usual weaknesses of fountain pens: thin ink that can blob with cheap paper, nib that can be damaged by heavy pressure while writing. Also note that the cartridges are proprietary. All in all, if you like fountain pens but are not into the ""big bucks"" variety, then the Metropolitan is a nice choice.",6,14.652767

1153,"This is my first Rite in rain pen
Got the orange so I don't lose this $$ pen
Was nervous because reviews
The paint is fine, can understand why some say it's cheap
I can live with that

But the cheap feel of the pen, no
Feels like a cheap dollar store pen
Why? Feels hollow
Feels like an empty very thin metal pen
Not solid feel to it at all

The biggest reason for my 1 star is because you have to write with the pen fairly vertical or it doesn't write good.
Like you scrap the edge of the metal where the ball meets.
Like using a mechanical pencil that needs more lead out.

Hope this helps others because saying feels cheap just didn't help me because everyone is different there",3,4.5607233
1154,"This box works great for organizing your cards and is much bigger than it appears. It is not toooo big though; it is perfect to fit plenty of cards so you are never late in sending your best wishes to friends and loved ones. You can use it two different ways, whichever suits your MO. You can organize by occasion, including miscellaneous, or by month. I purchased the item listed below to place my cards for each person in the coinciding month of the occasion and use the box for extra cards not yet designated for a particular person. I have two sets of thank-you cards and they both fit in the box as well as a bunch of other occasion cards as I collect them. I find this system very effective so far!

1155,This sign is doing a good job in the front window of my store.  It's visible and easy to read even through the tinting on the windows. I like the way the motion attracts eyes from the parking lot.  My main thing that I would like to see improved on it is that the chain that comes with it for hanging it up is very short.  I managed to make it work in my window by hanging if from the base of another sign that hangs above it.  But I could see places that don't have that kind of huge front window signage to piggy back off of having a tough time finding a way to mount it with that chain so that it would be anywhere near eye level for patrons to see.  It is a bargain sign.  It's not as super bright and impossible to miss as a fancy expensive sign. It's not a big sign. But it totally gets the job I intended it to do done just fine.  I'm very happy with it for the price.,3,4.3973284

I printed several sheets using different colors to test each cartridge and you would have thought it had original ink cartridges in it. To get 3 refills for each color at this price is amazing. I use to paying much more for generic cartridges. In my personal opinion, these work as well at original cartridges with the same quality of ink and colors.

1157,"The pencil is OK, and is wonderful to hold and write with as the size is great for my hand (rather large, I wear a large men's glove) and the lead is soft and has a very smooth glide to it; however, the pencil itself has a few problems.

First the lead is very short and soft so it is quickly used up.  I use up one of the leads in a couple of weeks.  The leads are more troublesome than necessary to change.  Second, the front of the pencil pulls off to change the lead and that is the failure point.  This pull off mechanism is a friction fit and it doesn't hold well.  My pencil is already starting to fall apart.  When I turn the front to advance the lead it kind of freewheels.  Plus the point section is loose and wiggles.

All in all a poor mechanical design.  So, the hold is excellent, the eraser is A plus, and the lead is super smooth, but the mechanical parts of the pencil are poor as the front gets loose quickly.  Also, the lead is very short and expensive given the size and number received in the little round box.

1160,"I had originally purchased this product as a way to hold my laptop up off my kitchen counter so I could work on it comfortably while standing up. Over time that morphed into using it while reclining in my lazy-boy chair. Then I got used to using it while in bed. For over a decade I had gotten used to plopping myself down into my office chair and working at my desk. Now I feel liberated getting out of my cramped office and being able to work from just about anywhere in the house.

But then the problems started. My daughter wanted to use it while she wrote her papers for school. My wife wants to use it while she is in bed. My ""work"" portable laptop tray was being hijacked by my family!

So now I am coming back to buy some more and realized I hadn't made a review.

The pros:

Lightweight material
Not too big, not too small
Three bend points seem to get it into the right position
Easy to clean

The cons:

Lightweight so the legs must be set correctly to support my seventeen inch laptops weight (there is a photo illustrated guide to help you)
Legs have many points of locking which at times felt like too many making it hard to line both sides up. Granted it does have numbers of degrees to help you, but it seems like it would be fine with only half of the locking spaces.

I really like this thing and so does my family. The issues I have with it seem to be product market wide and not specific to this one brand. I would definitely recommend this to a friend!",5,5.7613654

I like that seems easy to see how full it is. The sharpening stops when the pencil has a nice sharp point - sharp enough to write small, but not so thin that it breaks easily. There are various sized holes for various pencils, and there is a warning not to use waxy or colored pencils. I have never seen a pencil sharpener with a seven year guarantee before.

 have only had this printer for a few weeks and I am in LOVE.  It works so easily and I can print from my phone, tablet laptop etc.  It seems to use much less ink than the Epson it replaced.  I really enjoy the double sided option.

The packaging and shipping was fast and appropriate.  I would recommend this printer.

It hasn't worked with my desktop for sometime .... it sometimes prints and sometimes doesn't.  It always prints from my laptop.

I'm sick of buying things that can't be fixed.  I'm sick of putting electronics into the trash because no one can help them work again.  This needs to change.

For a while I was convinced the optical resolution was 2400 instead of the advertised 6400.

Eventually I discovered that the Epson software sucks.  I would recommend only using the Color Restoration (which seems to be first rate oddly) and Digital Ice options.  Everything else seemed to ruin the photos upon close inspection.  You will need to make any adjustments in photo shop.

In addition to this, the software is difficult to use.  It has an option to save your scanning settings -- but it doesn't work (on OSX at least).  I have to set the  option manually for every scan.  When you preview your scan, sometimes it only selects one photo when you mean to change the settings for them all.  Between these two problems, I find myself scanning photos with the wrong settings on a regular basis.  As a SW Engineer myself -- this is inexcusable.

Some people have complained the scanner is slow -- it is -- but if you compare specs it seemed to be in line with other scanners of this price.

Despite these problems I give the scanner 4 stars.  I own a Canon scanner and the software is *far* worse *and* the image quality sucks, so Epson wins by default: Marginal Software and excellent image quality seem to be a winning combination.",219,8.889228

The front pocket easily accommodates a protractor and 6"" ruler with a mechanical pencil, and the back one is probably where the extra pencils, erasers, and compass will be stored. I suspect the compass may poke through the mesh in the front pocket if it were put there.",2,7.165679
1197,"Based on the mixed reviews (and the inexpensive price), I bought this for my church hoping that it would turn out like the 5-star reviewers' printers.  Good thing for return policies.  I printed about 6 CDs on it -- only one looked good.  The rest would be missing a letter here or there or there would be a smear or the text would be all over the place.  I have included a picture of the CD that convinced me that it wasn't just a cartridge issue, as well as a picture of the unit.

1199,"I learned about Pilot parallel pens from watching an instructional video on YouTube, and they looked so easy to use that I had to look them up right away. If you're just learning calligraphy, as I am, and you don't want to start out with a dip pen system, I highly recommend these parallel pens. I find their flow to be very consistent when using medium firm pressure, whereas with some of the ""regular"" nibs, I had a difficult time getting an even flow. The price for the four sets cannot be beat, in my opinion.

Each pen comes individually packaged with a black cartridge, a red carting, a cap, a nib cleaner, a Pipette for cleaning the pen unit when changing cartridges, and an instruction pamphlet with charts for writing 3 fonts: Italic, Roman, and Gothic. It also includes some suggestions for warm up stroke exercises, as well as some samples of decorative elements.  The four pen sizes in the set are 6.0, 3.8, 2.4, and 1.5.",3,10.383345

I sharpened one pencil and even on the least pointy setting it took off a lot of the supporting wood and left a point very unlike the points that the colored pencils come with. I ended up purchasing a manual sharpener made by Prismacolor especially for their colored pencils, but now I find that the manual Prismacolor sharpener is actually harder on the soft lead, nicking it and pulling pieces off it. I am back to using the Artistique. Maybe I am just not very skilled at using the manual sharpener. The Artistique sharpener seems to protect the lead better than the manual one.

1208,"EDIT AND UPDATE - one year later the chair is still going strong, not falling apart or anything.. I should point out however that it sees infrequent use (my wife is not constantly on her laptop ;)  )

I should point out that this is a VERY subjective review on my part... what feels stiff and uncomfortable in a chair to me might be perfectly fine to another person.... having said that, after setting the chair up I found it to be somewhat stiff and uncomfortable as far as the back rest.. then again given the cheap price of the chair it's a matter of getting what you pay for so there's a limit to how much I can complain... this chair will see infrequent use (my wife is on the computer but not for long periods of time) so it would probably work best as an ""occasional use"" chair.

I should also point out that this chair is best suited to smaller sized men and women and children... at 5 feet 8 inches and (unfortunately, trying to lose weight ! ) 200 pounds I found that the chair felt rather small to me.... probably fine for infrequent use but again it would be a problem if I was sitting in it all day.

The chair comes with several parts and has to be screwed together in several places but this is typical of most chairs... I didn't find assembling the chair to be that difficult at all.  The screwdiver L-shaped bar thing that comes with it though - the way the chair is assembled you can't simply turn it in a full circle at every given spot in the chair.... you'll have to remove the L-shaped screwdiver, turn in a half circle, remove the l-shaped screwdriver, put it back in, turn again in a half circle and so forth for several parts of the chair... not a deal breaker for me but could be annoying for some people.

For the cost of three Andre Jacksons plus tax (the amazon bots won't let me put real prices in :P google slang terms for american currency ;)  ) you can get a better quality chair when it's on sale at Office Depot or Staples (check your Sunday flyers !  ) ... that's only one jackson  more than the price of this chair but , again, given the chair will see infrequent use I decided to just go ahead and save the twenty dollars.",3,9.920643

********UPDATE TO ORIGINAL REVIEW*********

I wrote the original review 6 hours ago and was very impressed with this product.  However, when I showed the medicine bottles to my husband tonight, some of the previously undistinguishable information could be FAINTLY seen through the dried roller ink!!!  It wasn't until AFTER I applied a permanent black marker over these areas that all information was totally concealed!!  I still would recommend this product.  However, I would advise the user to apply permanent marker over the dried roller ink to insure total permanent concealment.
I would give this product 4 STARS instead of the 5 stars, I originally gave.

OCTOBER 2013 UPDATE:  I AM EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT WHEN USED WITH A PERMANENT BLACK MARKER.  I FOUND THAT TOTAL BLACKOUT CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED BY APPLYING A PERMANENT BLACK MARKER ON TOP OF THE DRIED ROLLER INK.  USING A PERMANENT MARKER ALONE (without the ink roller) will NOT work- the printing on the Rx label will show through.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
This is the only product that I found that works on glossy Rx bottle labels!!  I tried permanent markers, acrylic paint markers, alcohol ink markers, and spray paint, plus MANY more things without success. The ONLY successful way I could remove my ""identifying information"" from a Rx bottle was to remove the label!  This was no easy feat either!! These labels could not be peeled off or scratched off with a fingernail.  I literally had to take a sharp instrument to scrape off parts of the label, soak the bottle in water, or repeatedly apply an adhesive remover!!!  I am THRILLED that I finally found this roller stamp!!!

The ink on this roller stamp blacks out the print on glossy labels so it cannot be read!!!  This stamp ""prints a pattern"" that makes it impossible to ""read"" anything it covered.  I tried this on several glossy labels and NONE of them could be read!  I really checked the labels for ANY visible identifying information.  I used a bright light and tilted the labels to see if the underlying information was visible from different angles and could not see any printed information!!!!

I HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product to anyone who cannot easily remove their identifying prescription labels. Just make sure you purchase the ""ADVANCED"" Roller Stamp that is designed for glossy labels. This is a real TIME SAVER and you will not be disappointed with the performance of this product.  The ONLY negative remark I have is that this ""self inking"" stamp is NOT refillable. Since I just got this, I cannot tell you how long it lasts. But, I will update this review when I have to replace this one.",44,14.57443

This pencil sharpener has the capability of running off of the provided power cord or 4 AA batteries. The battery capability is a nice touch as it makes this sharpener more portable. My favorite feature of this sharpener is the ability to pick what type of pencil tip you want with the slide of a button. It is a great feature with little kids in the house. I can get to the lead without getting a razor sharp tip. The pencil sharpener is quick and will get the desired tip in a few seconds. The pencil sharpener features a detachable shavings storage compartment that allows you to discard the shaving with ease. I have not had any issues with the quality or function of this sharpener.

The pages do curl but that seems relatively minor because they straighten right out. The print is sharp (if a little lighter than I would like).

In the research stage, I plagued Customer Service multiple times with questions but they were always nice, patient, and helpful. I especially liked it that their customer service is still free even after the warranty is over. I have not tried the scanner, but everything else suits me fine.

Color printing is just fair. there's significant wide banding for photos but, then, this isn't a photo printer. It's fine for color text if you use the Best function. Normal function is very light and washed-out color text.

1240,"My mom (in her late 60's) has been running Linux for years as her main system, because I'm her tech support and I gave up on Windows a decade ago. I've had her running Ubuntu for a few years with minimal issues. When her old printer died last week, she went to a well-known brick-and-mortar outfit and settled on either this printer or a similar Canon (she loves the AIO printers for their copy capabilities). I told her to go with the HP because HP offers Linux support, and Canon doesn't. I've always had issues with AIO's in Linux though, and dreaded the thought of hooking this printer up. I have to say, though, I was amazed at how well this printer works under Ubuntu. I connected the USB cable, and the printer was instantly recognized as a 7600 series. The print driver (at least on Open Office) gives access to the duplex modes and other settings, and both B/W and color printing worked flawlessly from the get-go. I then tried xsane, and sure enough, it identified the scanner on the printer. I tried color scans, multi-page ADF scans, etc., and it all worked with zero setup on my part. Amazing. I give HP four stars for some excellent linux drivers and a fully functional printer.

The remaining star I left off due to a few issues that have nothing to do with Linux. One, I haven't heard a printer make this much noise since the old lineprinter days of yore. Secondly, it's fast in single-page mode, but duplex mode is *much* slower because it pauses 10-15 seconds for the ink to dry before it runs the paper back in for the backside printing. Third, it takes 2-3 minutes for the printer to warm up after you turn it on.

I never did try the network connection as my mom doesn't have a switch, so I can't say how well this printer would work with Linux in a networked environment.

So, if you are running a recent version of Linux this printer should work fine for you, and you won't experience the bloated driver problems that the Windows and Mac folks seem to be having. It is a less polished offering than the current Canon models, though. Too bad Canon can't see fit to supply Linux drivers for their products.",3,9.778564

It's lightweight and compact, as well, and it has a ruler built into it.

The Bad: It doesn't work as advertised, it's flimsy, and cheap. It says it will cut up to seven sheets of paper at a time, but I couldn't get it to work with more than three. And those, it tended to merely perforate instead of giving a clean cut, so I had to tear them apart along the score it made. If you're only cutting one sheet of paper, however, it works great! It's made of cheap plastic, so you have to treat it gently.

Conclusion: I definitely wouldn't pay full price for this trimmer. It's just too flimsy to get the job done. If you can find it for a couple of dollars, and you don't need to cut more than a page or two at a time, then I'd say go for it. Otherwise, find something more efficient.",120,7.5767045

The colors printed fine with no smearing. Make sure that you choose the correct paper type when printing so you get the best quality print out. The first time I choose a the wrong paper weight and the printer put more ink on the paper than it can handle - (it will show through, the colors will look bad, and the paper will buckle.)

I made some Christmas cards using stamps, embossing powders and markers and they turned out nice, too.

The cards are scored in the center for easy folding, and the color is a nice bright white.

The envelopes (like others have said) are pretty flimsy. But for me, the envelope is not all that important and I don't run an envelope through my printer. True, the manufactures could improve on the envelopes, but overall they worked ok.

The base of the unit broke/came off sometime between China and Staples (purchased on line from Staples because Amazon was out of stock and the next lowest price was 12 dollars more).  Our office literally had a cloud of dust in the air from the sand filling.
With a little thought on the part of the manufacturer this problem could easily and inexpensively be remedied: put the sand filler in sealed bags to contain it and then put the bag or bags in the base. And of course use a stronger adhesive or metal fasteners to attach the plastic base -- if that hadn't come apart, there wouldn't have been any spillage.
The dispenser part of the unit appears to be well made (molded plastic) and so far works very well.

I would expect to pay at least twice this amount for the set after seeing it in person.  My husband loves them, the way they write and how they sit in his hand.  He is an architect and uses them a lot, so the weight of the writing utensil makes a difference.  I am very pleased with my purchase, and am very happy I took the chance and got these.

The pencil completely stopped working in this set.  I don't know if the mechanism was faulty, but I have tired everything to get it working again, with no success.  Its very disappointing since I have only owned them a couple months and since they were a gift to my husband I feel even worse.

There is nothing I disliked about the quality or performance of the tray and I would recommend it to anyone.  There is one caveat that you should be aware of, however.  Besides the obvious that you could not mount it to a glass-top desk, you should also be aware that many desks made today have a hollow core top (much like an interior door in your house).  The mounting plate needs something very solid to screw in to (the tray is the heaviest I have ever seen). If your desktop is hollow core the screws would rip right out.  You have a couple of options.  One would be to install a wood mounting plate from the front of your desk to the rear which you would attach into the solid wood edges, or another option would be to use short Molly-type mounts for the rear screws of the keyboard mount.

1282,"I emphasized the word ""deterrent"" because that's what the results of this product are.  The size of the cross-cut shreds from this product are absolutely a deterrent for someone looking through your trash/recycling for a target of opportunity, but they aren't going to stop someone who is actually targeting _you_.  Someone could piece these back together or use a scanner and software to reconstruct your documents.  Perhaps that's common knowledge, but I wanted to state it if it's not.  Some added techniques are to split up your shredding into different bags and put them out on different days, to soil them with something (like messy food waste), or to burn it.  But, for most people, these shreds will be fine.  So...good if you're trying to encourage a meth head to move on to the next recycling bin, but bad if you're trying to stop corporate espionage.

The shredder works pretty fast and isn't too loud (not quiet, mind you, but not too bad).  Works great on paper, photos, and credit cards (thanks to Target getting hacked, I had a spare to try).  The included container is a nice touch, and I always put a plastic bag inside to line it before shredding to make emptying it easier.  It says it has a six-sheet capacity, and that's true - it will do six sheets no problem, but that seems to be the practical limit.  For folks that do a little shredding at a time (some mail here and there, bank statements from time to time), the speed of this will suit you just fine.  If you're looking to clear out that closet before you move (or because the FBI is knocking on your door :eek:), then you might want to step up to a higher-capacity model.

CAUTION - please be careful when unpacking this (or when moving it).  The shredding blades underneath of the top unit are recessed but exposed, and it's easy to hit those when you reach into the box to pull this out for the first time.  Well, or I'm just special.  :D  Seriously, though, be careful.

It is the right thickness, gives good color saturation, and is a sturdy paper. Perfect for my needs.

I couldn't find a plain old photo printer that offered great pictures and a wifi connection, for a decent price. You have to go multifunction even if you don't need all the other functions.
So my review is all about the photo aspect of this printer.
1. The software included for enhancing pictures, is less than basic. There is not much you can do with it, and it is not worth anything. You can use any other program you have, or even download Open Source software like GIMP, and it is better than this.
2. Full HD Movie Print Software Included; however you need to have a Canon camera to use it! Even if you can take movies in HD and they are in .mov format, you can't use this feature because ""there is signature data attached to each video taken by a Canon camera.  If the program does not see that information, it will not allow you to take pictures from your video files."" This is a quote from Canon support.
3. Airprint is a feature you don't need if you are connected through a WiFi router in your home anyway.
4. Google Cloud Print worked fine, but when I set it up (You have to have Google Chrome on your computer to set this up.) it also detected my other printer that was still hooked up to my computer. So I didn't actually need this printer for Google Cloud printing. Google Cloud was an OK feature if you want to send pictures, or an email, to your home to print while you are away. It does not work too well for attachments like an article from the web. (Unless it is in ""Reader"" format). Maybe it will improve when it is out of the BETA stage.
5. The gray ink uses up quickly. But I knew and expected that.

The cover is nice and thin with a single round elastic band for closure.

After having a bad experience with this phone a few months ago, I foolishly decided to have it replaced instead of just being credited for the purchase price.

Multiple calls were made to the Uniden ""help"" number, but none of their suggestions worked.  Talking on this phone is like talking on a cell phone that has bad reception.  Or maybe two cans with a wax string connection",4,4.518695

It unrolls flat and stays that way. If feels really smooth with my mouse movements and doesn't cause skipping. It also doubles as a writing surface, causing ink and pencil to depress paper further than a hard surface. Spills are easily cleaned with a water soaked sponge and air drying. Would recommend for those with a flat desk, unless your pullout tray fits the dimensions.

Note: it was kinda stinky fresh out of the tube, a strange adhesive smell. This went away in a day and now the pad has that sweet tire store rubber smell expected from a new mousepad.",2,6.4344316
1293,"I'm admittedly biased to Epson printers as their hardware and software (drivers) offer the best quality on the market, but they've taken the R1800 and made it even better with the R1900.  The R1900 is the ONLY pigment printer currently on the market that can create believable glossy prints.  I'm not sure why Epson hasn't gone the gloss optimizer route on their more expensive models like the 3880, 4800, 9800, etc. but this R1900 would be my choice over ALL models even if price and size/footprint is not a factor.  I work in the digital photography business and have a half dozen high end photographic printers, both pigment and dye, from Epson, Canon, and HP, and this printer rates 5 stars for me whereas the next closest pigment printer would be lucky to get 3 stars.

1296,"Beware of ordering here if the product is being sold by Yoyoink!!!!

My first order of Ecolite Kraft Bubble Mailers fulfilled by The Boxery were fantastic. Exactly as ordered and perfect for mailing DVDs and Blu-Rays. Shipped hundreds using these mailers and no issues.

As I ran low I clicked on my previous order and ordered again but did not realize Amazon had linked a different company to fulfill this order. A company called Yoyoink. The mailers that Yoyoink fulfilled off of the exact same Amazon listing are NOT Ecolite. They are very poor quality, very thin, and smaller then the Ecolite mailers. The Ecolite mailers should say Ecolite on them across the bottom and the Yoyoink mailers do not.

If you see Yoyoink as the company in the SOLD BY field, I would caution you to re-consider as they have proven to be shady in advertising Ecolite while fulfilling sub-par products.

I have since re-ordered two cases of these from The Boxery via the same link as the first order I did with them was perfect. Hope this fixes the problem.

UPDATE: I tried to give this item 5 stars before since I've used this exact Ecolite product and it's a great product. The one star rating is for this listing not for Ecolite's product. The problem here is that Amazon does not seem to have any control over who is fulfilling the products per this listing so one seller is sending actual Ecolite (in my case TheBoxery) and another is fulfilling a non-Ecolite product (Yoyoink). This seems to be happening often enough to be a systemic problem and not just one or two mistaken shipments.

I've spent a good amount of time with Amazon reps on this issue only because it seems to be affecting many customers, some of whom don't know that they are being shipped non-Ecolite products. I think this is hurting the Ecolite brand name and I feel bad for them on this front.

The Amazon reps keep insisting I was shipped the wrong product and they want me to pay for return shipping. After a lot of back and forth they agree to give a credit towards future Amazon products for the cost of shipping. All the while they insist that I was just shipped the wrong product instead of acknowledging that sellers should not be using this listing for non-Ecolite similar products.",56,14.510064

1301,"I splurged a little in my moving boxes this year and bought these instead of going through the process of saving ALL my boxes and stealing boxes and having mismatched-sized boxes, and I'm glad I did.

These are very easy to put together, which makes me happy because it seems that it will be easy to store them unfolded in a closet for future use. The handles in the boxes are with two pieces of cardboard (because of how you fold it) so the boxes are extremely sturdy. The lids are easy to put together and fit on great.

I appreciate that there is plenty of space for me to write exactly whats in the box. I have been doing this with a brown marker and its been working great. I have about 8 of them packed already and just appreciate that I can stack them all simply on top of each other because they are all the same size.

One box I have is completely filled with textbooks. It hasn't messed with the integrity of the box at all and because its the small size, I can still lift the box easily.

I love this product. The only reason I won't be buying it again is because, while it says Prime, they won't ship for 2-4 weeks (I'm assuming because they are out of stock) and I need them in the next week and a half.

1306,"These are just a few of the items that are needed to have a complete kitchen. ;-) The printer was a perfect match to the computer, which is an MSI touchscreen and is small enough to fit almost anywhere.  You just never know when you might need to print out that recipe, store coupon, or perhaps a knitting pattern.

This was an interesting printer to set up, different from the ones I have done before. I say this because the quick start manual says to make sure the printer is not connected to anything and install the software. In all the other printers I have set up, the manuals walk you completely through the setup. This printer walks you through the complete procedure using the CD and the LCD screen on the printer. The package print head is located inside the printer and the CD will make you aware of that. But, I investigated inside first before I did anything else, and removed the printer head. The ink cartridges are in the area where the paper is ejected.  After completing the steps of installing the print head, and then the ink cartridges, the printer will want to align the print head, and upon doing so a page is printed out. Make sure the paper tray is fully extended. Otherwise, the paper will either jam or wrinkle, inside the area. The paper tray has a small lip at the end to prevent the paper from sliding off.  Next comes the procedure of finding your network. Again, this is where the Lexmark is different from any other printer. I have set up a few wireless printers, and  most printers are set up using their LCD display, usually somewhere in settings or network or however the printer manufacturer describes it. The Lexmark does it through the computer that you're setting it up for. Going through the steps it will ask you if you have a certain type of router that has a button on it that I have never seen. When you answer no, the next window that comes up asks you to connect the provided USB cable from the computer you are working on to the printer. By pressing continue it will search for your network, which you can identify and enter an encryption key if needed. After that, Lexmark lets you know it has made the connection and to disconnect the USB cable. Now you are able to print wirelessly.  So I gave it a try just to see if there was a lot of lag time between sending the data from the computer to the final print out. My setup goes from the kitchen to a room where the router is and back to the printer in the kitchen and to my surprise the lag time was very short.

The next thing I usually do is to try out the software that was installed on the computer. Under Lexmark there's a program called Printer Home. This is what you want to click on in order to have the versatility of the printer.  There are four scan categories to choose from - photo, documents, e-mail and PDF.  The scan to photo has two options; one, the single photo, and the other is split into individual photo. The second one was interesting. Lexmark will ask you if you want a test page printed out at the end of the set up. It prints out a page with a color bar on the top, the Lexmark logo on the right hand side, some hot air balloons in the middle and another color bar at the bottom of the page. When you select the second option of splitting the photo into individual photos it literally saved four versions of the photo. The color bar was one, the logo was the second, the hot air balloons was the third, and the color bar at the bottom was the fourth. This was an interesting first for me. I can definitely see some interesting possibilities. Of course the rest of the categories are pretty straightforward. Scanning to a document or to an e-mail or making it a PDF. The Printer Home software gives you the most options of how you want to scan and save different things in different formats. Plus it has other options at the bottom of its page, such as print head alignment, wireless setup, and so forth.  Next it was time to use the LCD control panel on the printer. The LCD panel swings out from the body of the printer and stays in its 45 position by friction. So I wondered if the panel would stay in his position as you push down the different icons on the screen. The touchscreen is very sensitive, so pushing on the screen is  a very light touch, and that helps  the panel stay in position.

Copying offers a lot of options. Things like number of copies, color or black-and-white. You can also select more options, which expands the versatility of copying, such as two into one, eight to one and 16 to 1. Along with other options such as paper type, paper size, quality, and the band plays on.  This is where an automatic document feeder is missed. If you had a two-sided sheet that you wanted to print out, you have to scan one side and then the other manually. This printer does have the capability of duplexing, which does add to the features.

Next feature tried from the LCD control panel on the printer was scanning. The options here are a little limited, compared to using the software. When you choose scan you have the option of scanning to the computer, scanning to memory device or scanning to e-mail.  When I say a little limited, I mean that everything I scanned to a file was always in JPEG form, whereas the software gives you the option of other formats. The computer would have to be on anyway in order to scan to the computer or to e-mail, but if you are just scanning to a memory device, I guess this would be very convenient.

The last icon on the LCD control panel is Smart Solutions. It comes with a few smart solutions on it to begin with, I.D. card copy and photo reprint. But in order to get the full features of smart solutions you need to go and create an account at the Lexmark website. This is easy to do. You can either click on the link that the software provided on your computer under Lexmark or on the LCD panel under the smart solutions icon then click on more options. There's a link there that will send your browser to the smart solution page.  The only other one I added to my smart solution was the MSNBC link, but there are quite a few to choose from. There are even smart solutions that you can customize for copying and scanning.

I also had to see what would happen by plugging in a USB thumb drive into the printer. It recognized the thumb drive and gave me three options on the LCD screen. One is photo, the other is document, and the last is send to e-mail. I chose photo to see what the LCD screen would display, and lo and behold, two pictures I had put on the thumb drive showed up. So I decided to print out one of them. You can just accept it and print it or you can go into more options and adjust all the settings. Then I tried looking at a document. It listed of all the supported documents, which are many, on the thumb drive. Next I removed the thumb drive and inserted a USB cable from my camera to the printer. The Pictbridge icon came up. When I tapped the icon, it told me to print from the camera, so I scrolled through the LCD on the camera, picked a picture, clicked on more options, selected my settings and printed the picture. With the 4.2 LCD screen, looking at pictures makes it easy to decide what you want to print out. The bottom of the LCD panel has four icons, one for eco-mode (duplexing, printing in draft, and reducing the backlight on the LCD panel), one for duplexing, one for settings, and the one that I appreciate the most is the amount of ink that is left in the cartridges.

My first all-in-one was the original Lexmark for home users. This continued to work flawlessly until the day I got rid of it. The biggest reason I upgraded to another type of printer was because of the cost of the ink for the Lexmark and the problems of the ink drying out when not in use. I hope this situation has improved. I like the uniqueness of this printer because of the LCD screen and the option that it gives you to interact with the outside world rather than just print or scan.  Is this a printer I would use for a small business - No.  Is this a printer I would use for the home office? I think that would depend on how much printing I was planning on doing every day. With each cartridge having a yield of 100 you could be using ink at a rapid rate. Is this a printer I would have for personal use, most definitely. This is a fun printer to use, and it has enough versatility to suit my personal needs at a reasonable price.",25,12.889579

1309,"The main reason I bought these folders were because they were colored, not because of the pocket inside.  The pocket was just an added bonus.  I am a fourth grade teacher, and there are a few activities I am doing with the students where I really needed some color folders.

The colors are bright and the folders are nice.  I would have liked for the tab position on the folders to be varied per color.  Meaning, all of the green folders have the tab in the same position, all the yellow have their tab in the same position, etc.  I would have preferred that each color had staggered tabs.  It's not a huge deal, but it seems that it should have been that way.

The pocket inside is handy for holding smaller items, although I'm not really sure we'll use that often.  The pocket is formed so that if you have these folders filed in a cabinet, whatever you have in the pocket should stay there since the opening to the pocket would be facing up.  If, however, you are carrying the file around like you would carry a notebook, the opening to the pocket is on the side, so there is a chance it could fall out.  In my classroom, the students will be walking around with their folders, so I am hesitant to put things in that small pocket.  Nine and ten year olds aren't the best at organization, and I'm sure whatever is in that pocket would fall out.

Generally, the pockets are nice because of the bright colors, they are sturdy, and seem very well made.  It would have been a 5-star review if the tabs were staggered per color.  Overall I am very happy with my purchase and wouldn't hesitate to order again next school year when I need to make new folders for the kids.",18,9.39092
1310,"I had another drawer organizer that was made of hard, more brittle plastic, and it cracked from use. I bought two of these for my kitchen 'catch-all' drawer to keep various hardware-ish things including light tools like screwdrivers, pliers, etc.

- Various size compartments
- Deeper than most organizers
- They're black and won't show dirt
- More flexible plastic that won't crack
- Sides are straight up & down, maximizes space

1311,"I'm new to the world of fountain pens, but I have to say that I am completely in love with my extra fine Lamy Safari. I bought this ink as a replacement for the cartridge that first came with my pen.  I chose to purchase the Polar Black because not only will it not freeze (which I'm not worried about) but it is bulletproof and lubricated.  Maybe its because the ink is lubricated that I'm having problems.  I find that the ink feathers very badly.  I am an art student and I use anything from notebook paper, to printer paper, to drawing paper- I find that this ink feathers no matter what. It actually makes my work look sloppy due to the very thick lines (which shouldn't happen with an ef nib) and the feathering that takes place.

Although it may write smoother than the default ink cartridge that came with my Safari, I can't recommend this ink over it.  Someone correct me if I'm wrong.  This may be all Noolder inks for all I know or just this particular type. I did purchase Blue-Black and Royal Purple from Noodlers so I will see then.

I do like that Noodlers is an American based company and you get your monies worth because they fill it to the brim.  I am slightly disappointed in this ink.  I wish there was a way I could have tried it before purchasing because there is so much ink in one jar that even if I did like this it would last me close to a year.

1313,"When recently I opened an eBay store, I knew that to help have the lowest prices around, I wanted a shipping scale. I had started off by putting everything in Priority pre-made boxes, however it wasn't until I put guesstimated weights into the USPS shipping calculator that I realized how much I (and in turn my customers) were missing out on savings.

I rarely ship anything that weighs more than 10lbs, so I decided to go with a light duty shipping scale, and I have not been disappointed! The weighmax is very accurate (I double checked the first few weights at my local post office) and is so easy to use. All I have to do is switch it on, set it to weigh in lbs, and away I go.

PROS
- Very economical
- Accurate when compared to USPS scales
- Has remained accurate over a year
- Ability to weigh in customary and metric units
- Can be powered by both battery and AC adapter
- Fantastically simple operation

CONS
- Defaults to metric units after being off for a while

The easy interface, accurate measurements, and cheap price, make me recommend this product without reservation.

1322,"For the home user this machine is more than enough.  Cross cut shredding up to 18 sheets simultaneously along with credit cards and CDs..
I ran some tests with the following good and marginal results :

The good;
- Cross cut sizes:  1 or 2 sheets cut just fine into about 1/8 by 1.5 inch lengths.  See picture attached.
- Credit cards and CDs no problem.  The shredder cut those up just fine.
- Staples no problem:  I loaded up 2 8.5x11 sheets with about 30 standard staples along all 4 edges and the shredder chewed up the sheets without jamming or slowing
- Input Overload prevention:  The opening is just larger then the thickness of 18 sheet 20lb paper which is about 1/16"" so a nice feature to help keep from over loading.
- Now the bin is great.  Its viewable through the clear front fairly large at 7 gallons and simply slides out to empty it.  Really nice not to have to remove the heavy shredder head to empty.
- Auto start/stop worked every time.  Once you shove the paper in far enough, as long as its near the center where the switch sensor is, it will start and stops a moment after the paper has passed through.

The marginal:
- Its slow:  It takes about 5 seconds to shred a 8.5 x 11 sheet.  In an office this is probably too slow except for personal use.
- 18 sheets do not cross cut:.  I put 18ea 20lb 8.5x11 sheets of paper into the feed.  With the thick mass the shredder did not quite make the cross cut.  It made long cuts and you can see from the picture attached that where it tried but failed to cross cut .  For personal use I would think just fine but it doesn't perform as advertised.
- I thought maybe a little pricey for a home use machine.
- failed after 1.5yrs of home use

Conclusion:  The  machine cut up everything it claimed from credit cards to paper loaded with staples and the ease of viewing the basket and emptying it is a great convenience.  On the negative side it is a bit slow and it did not cross-cut large paper inputs of 18 sheets but was still able to cut lengthwise.

Nothing happens.  Now, if you whack the top of it before you insert the papers to be stapled, it will work fine.  Once.

1328,"I think this is a brilliant idea -- I've used post-its for years, and often thought a removable label would be perfect.  These are pretty good, but not quite perfect yet.

They stick to glass just fine.  I use them to label the jars of different coffees I have on hand.  I reuse quart jars to hold individual varieties of both ground and whole bean coffees in my pantry.  This allows me to change up my collection and change labels without worrying about leaving sticky residue.  They're colorful, too -- and look nice.

Sticking to plastic was a problem.  I found that they stick to some disposable plastic containers (Rubbermaid Take-Alongs, for example), but NOT to the more durable reusable plastic containers.  This will be an issue for a lot of folks, I'm sure.

Getting an individual label off the pad can be an issue, too.  Some days I could extract a single label with no problem; other days, it was a struggle.  I'm not sure what the problem was -- humidity, maybe?

1332,"UPDATE (02/06/2018): I'm NOT happy with these! Several of the rubber bumpers have come off the base. Plus, the cover plates are constantly falling off and I frequently find myself needing to hover down to perform fixes. These are in areas with light traffic and minimal use! I thought I was buying a high quality item and shelled out a little more than I wanted for a detail as minor as freaking door bumpers, but I appreciated the aesthetics. Should have just stuck with those ugly ones that look like wire slinkies. At least they don't fall apart!

Original Review 01/21/2018: I adore the way these look. And I almost feel guilty saying this, as I'm constantly bitching about companies making low quality items, but they're almost too heavy-duty for my needs. The diameter is quite large for the standard size baseboards I installed them on. The mount base plate nearly overlaps the top edge. I believe these would look absolutely amazing on 4"" or + baseboard  trim. Or... Use them above the trim on the wall if it's solid enough.

All of the materials seem durable and high quality. These seem solid!

Installation is rather straight forward. It requires drilling in the base plate with 2 screws. The top plate is then placed over the base to hide the screws and finish the look. (They seem to fit very securely so I'm not concerned about them coming loose and falling off any time soon!) The pole is attached to the mounting base plate with a single screw (they come already in) and can be easily tightened by twisting. After a little trial and error, I highly recommend drilling in pilot holes first. Due to the narrow distance between the pole and the mounting holes, drilling is a little ackward. Even with my Milwaukee drill turned up to 16, I struggled to get enough force for a clean insertion and almost burned out the screw.

My only concern: I hope the rubber bumper lasts. One fell off during install, but it was easy to get back on. It just thinking long term... Will they all still be intact in 3 years? (I will update my review if this ever becomes an issue.)",6,8.56429

1355,"I bought these to hang small art pieces and they have worked fairly well. When I use them to hang 4x4"" canvas panels, they work great, but I think that's because the panels are very light and the adhesive is attached to paper on the back of the panel and therefore sticks well. I have also used them on 4x4"" aluminum panels, which are very thin and therefore almost as light as the canvas panels, but I have had a few of them come off. Maybe it's because they don't stick to metal as well so I'm going to test putting a paper label on the back before attaching the tabs. The thing I like about these tabs is they don't make the art stick out from the wall. If you hang pieces on a nail with a large, flat head, the pieces will lay almost flat against the wall. You can get small plastic spacers for the bottom corners of the pieces, and that makes it even better. I purchased these (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IL6E1RS?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_24) for that purpose.

1365,"I use these to print VERY low-coverage jobs (printing mailing addresses on envelopes, and printing some additional information on pre-printed order forms). The coverage was probably 50% of what a full page of double-spaced text would be. These are my results:

 Cartridge 1 didn't print well from the start, with random toner blotches and lines. After about 500 envelopes, the print was very faded, even with blotchy, missing areas. If I pulled the cartridge out every 10 or so envelopes, it would get dark again, but then fade after 10 or so more.  I then started printing some order forms which is probably 25% of a normal typed page worth of coverage (just a date and some pricing in certain places). Within 500 prints (1000 total), toner was gone, even though the software was saying 30% left. Shaking didn't help.

Cartridge 2 printed great for about 100 prints, then started fading. I'm currently at 600 VERY low-coverage prints and have to pull it out every 10-15 prints in order for it to stay normal dark-ness.

As a comparison, with a Samsung toner cartridge, I've printed 4000-4500 of these envelopes/forms before they ran out (they also claim 1500 yield). This product barely made it to 1000 printing the same thing, and even then, only by pulling the cartridge out and shaking it.

Once the magnets are attached, they are solidly on there--and the magnets are very strong, so I have no worries about the board sliding down or falling off my fridge.

The surface of the board is flat and even, as you'd expect. It takes marker well, and it's easy to erase the marker completely. The board has a metal frame that looks nice, though it doesn't feel especially durable. I suspect it will easily ding up over time. I like that the board comes with its own magnetic dry erase pen (the cap has a magnet attached), but, again, the quality isn't particularly great.

1370,"I ran out of both my Copic X-Press Blend it paper and the Neenah solar white 80lb card stock on my last paper purchase. I knew I loved the Copic paper, so trying the Neenah was not only a cheaper option, but if I liked it I had 250 sheets vs my 125 sheets from Copic. After running out of those two...and they were both able to do the job I wanted, to use in card making (not for card bases). I did find the Neenah to be quite yellowing compared to the Copic paper, so when I heard other card makers trying this paper...I thought it only fair to give it a chance against my preferred Copic paper & Neenah paper.
The first thing I noticed was that this is not marketed as cardstock, the second, that for the number of sheets this paper was almost a third of them will admit I've only gotten to hold, feel, and try my Copics on this Hammermill paper for a short time, as I haven't had it that long.
I have attached some photos, with more examples to come with the Copic markers at work on all three of these papers. For now, I have four to share with you.  The first shows how my paper came packaged and the shape it arrived it. The second photo shows the only tear...if you want to call it damage to my package...and that was a small slit of one of the creases in the ream packaging, with absolutely zero damage to the the paper inside!
The third picture shows all three of the papers I mention in this review. Can you tell which is which? (Photograph was taken under an Ott-lite for the best comparison). For the third photo your choices are:  Hammermill, Copic, Neenah. (Answers found at the very end). The fourth picture shows two papers. Can you tell which is the Hammermill and the other Copic?

More comparisons and photos to follow,  as I get use to this new paper more as well as my opinion of the overall paper for Copic marker use.

1. Copic, Neenah, and Hammermill. 2. Hammermill, Copic

------------------
This is my update that I promised all. I have added one more photo that hopefully will be of interest to those that want to use this paper for Copic coloring use. Using Memento Tuxedo Black ink I stamped a small stamp on all three papers that I mentioned in my initial review: Copic X-Press It Blending Paper, Neenah 80lb white cardstock, and the Hammermill Color Copy Digital Cover 100lb paper. Using the same stamp and the same colors each of the penguins were colored as close as I possibly could. I do not claim to be a fantastic at Copic coloring but I thought it might be interesting to a few the colors I used. The penguin: N4, N2, N0. The beak & feet: Y17, Y15, Y13. The earmuffs: V09, V15...with the tip to tip technique to blend these colors not side by side in the Copic system.

What are my thoughts about this Hammermill paper instead of the Copic paper or Neenah cardstock? I'm still in love with the Copic paper. For me it comes in #1 every time. It is very white, I love the weight, and the markers just glide across it! The Neenah is my second runner-up. The Hammermill comes in third.
Both Neenah and the Hammermill are smooth. But if money was no option I'd pass on the Neenah simply because the paper tends to yellow. It also does not feel as smooth to me as the Copic. I have used the 80lb Neenah paper as I don't make my own card bases. But the 100lb Neenah is thicker than the Copic, and the 80lb Neenah is thinner. Because the Copic paper is not rated by lb, and instead by gsm, it's hard to know what it's weight is. Based on this amateurs` calculations the Copic comes out to be between 93 and 97 lb paper. To me, it's the perfect weight.

The Hammermill is 100lb, but that isn't the first things that jumped out at me...and not doing this test side by side was essential to me remembering what it is like to color on each and what I loved and didn't love so well. Paper is a personal preference but I hope this helps someone. This Hammermill paper is smooth to the look and touch, but I could feel a good deal of friction when coloring. The paper seems to really suck the Ink from my marker...even with a small image like this. From top to bottom the penguins I colored are on: 1. Copic, 2. Neenah, 3. Hammermill. I don't think this is bad paper, and I fully intend to try and use my ream before replentishing my paper supply. Time will tell.  I've heard people say this is a duplicate paper of the Copic. It is definitely not!

If price is a concern, definitely try this. I still believe this is excellent paper for the cost. I also believe if you do cards, enjoy the Neenah! But if your entire works of art are done with Copics...invest in the Copic paper!",16,12.724611

As an anniversary present to myself, I finally justified a way to spend the money!
If you're looking to buy Prismacolor pencils, then you most likely don't need a review because you probably already know about them, but I'd be happy to give you my opinion.  I love these... the smooth and creamy application is wonderful, but so far the neon pink & orange are a bit waxier than the other pencils.  I have NOT (yet) had any issues w/ broken leads.  I will update this review if I do.  I found and printed a blank color chart for the 150 set and colored it in.  In the process of doing so, I discovered that I had received two of one color and none of another.  I called Newell Rubbermaid, they asked me to email them the UPC code & receipt of purchase, which I did.  I received the missing pencil about a week later.
Personally, I think the presentation and packaging leaves a lot to be desired for a $300+ set of colored pencils.  The plastic storage trays are flimsy, which could result in dropped pencils/broken leads.  It would also be nice of them to include a blank color chart, but the pencils themselves are awesome!",3,8.663227

1379,"Good value, fun colors.  These are not expensive fountain pens. While they don't write as nicely as a pen that cost as much as this entire set of seven, these are not at all bad.  I've found that keeping them in a cup, facing point down (yes, with the covers on <G>)  works to improve and maintain a more consistent flow.  So, while there are some flow issues from time to time, I've already gotten my money's worth with the first picture.

The choice of colors is, IMO, quite good.  What was a pleasant surprise, in addition to the strong saturated colors which work with each other, was the yellow.  Expecting a weak, basically invisible yellow, proving that a little yellow does not always go a long way, I was happily surprised.  The yellow is more of a vibrant yellow-gold which DOES hold up to the other colors with no need to lay it on thickly.  All in all, .if you like playing with pens and different colors of ink, this is a fun set.  I'd say the nibs are medium.  Definitely NOT fine (preferred by some, not by me).  While not broad, the nibs are perhaps slightly on the generous side of medium.  That works nicely for me.  The same set with a fine nib would be interesting, totally different, and not for me.  Perfect for some others I'm sure.  While I know it means about nothing, I admit that I am amused that the color of the metallic looking coating on the nibs matches the color of the ink.  Cute.  The pens come with the cartridges wisely not connected.  They dry out much more slowly than after connected.
I wonder, now that I've connected all of the cartridges to all of the nibs, if I need to use these pens to keep things flowing  If they dry up, I should be fine by opening the pen, same as if changing an ink cartridge.  I'll remove the cartridge over some paper and soak the nib in water.  I like washing warm water through the nib.  Soak the water out of the nib pretty much by holding toilet paper on the back of the nib.  My  preference is to put nibs needing cleaning into an ultrasonic jewelry cleaner for a while. Then, flush with water, and repeat until clear.  Soak extra water as above.  replace the cartridge.  Write on blank expensive rare handmade paper to clear the water, and when the ink is flowing again, throw the expensive paper in the recycle.  Wasting trees is bad.  Joking about the paper.",25,12.060939
1380,"It's a very comfortable pencil. It feels great while writing and the shaking for lead only requires a simple flick of the wrist. The major problem I have with this pencil is the eraser. It uses a very very small eraser like many other pencils, but half of it is unusable as it sits inside the pencil. If you wear the eraser down too much (which is easily done), it's very difficult to remove the remaining nub (which hinders access to add lead). Overall a great pencil, but only if you have a dedicated eraser.",8,5.927708

The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because the Wikki Sticks do leave a residue on the pages.

2) I had issues installing the replacement Black cartridge.  My husband googled the problem and found that this is common with Epson printers.  We tried all suggested fixes with no success.  He ended up buying a new cartridge and returning the one that wouldn't work, then problem solved.  It has to do with a chip that comes with the cartridges that's supposed to prevent the use of non-Epson ink.  NOT COOL!  Seriously, if you're going to do that kind of thing, then at least manufacture a replacement product that's not going to fail so often.
3) All of a sudden, when I replaced one color cartridge, the Epson ink meters were reading low for the other cartridges as well.  What the heck!

1410,"I have always stuck with OEM ink, because the results and reliability are worth the extra cost to me (plus printer manufacturers are making it increasingly difficult to use non-OEM solutions).

However, it is beyond dumb to see the combos that Canon is offering for the new line of ink jet cartridges.  In this case Canon gives you four color cartridges, but all of their current PIXMA printers take five or six - to get the Pigment Black or Gray cartridges you'll have to buy them separately and at a higher price.  Plus this combo includes 50 sheets of paper that not everyone needs (I have plenty already).  Perhaps Canon should ditch the paper and lower the list price of this combo by eight dollars - the amount this CLI-226 combo was increased over the CLI-221 combo it replaced.

BTW, the other package deal offered by Canon (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PGI-225-BK-CLI-226-C-M-Y-4-Pack-Value-Pack-4530B008/dp/B003QR87I6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PGI-225 BK/ CLI-226 C,M,Y 4 Pack Value Pack (4530B008)</a>) is another strange combo that includes Pigment Black and three colors, but does not include Black or Gray.

Sorry, but it makes no sense whatsoever to not offer at least a 5-cartridge refill kit for a printers that needs 5 or 6 different inks - except that it lines Canon's pockets a bit more than it should.  A kit that substituted Pigment Black for the paper would make more sense than this - or as I said earlier just get rid of the paper and lower the price significantly.

  So I do a little research on what the best pencils are and not to my surprise I find a bunch of posts by school teachers saying they lose so much time because Dixon pencils along with so many other poorly made pencils force the kids to keep sharpening their pencils when the lead falls out frequently.  Most of them had similar recommendations so I decided to purchase a few different brands to see which ones worked best for us.

The VTech DECT 6.0 system fit the bill and was ideal for our uses.  With a simple ""base"" station and one extension it allows us to control the use of the phone in our 2 story home (3 teenagers - need I say more?) at very reasonable expense.  I was surprised the phones were so light and actually weighed less than half of one of our old Panasonic cordless phones.

Out of the box, these were super simple to use.  Once plugged in to an active line, the base station and second line established connection immediately with no need for me to input registration or serial numbers.  As the system is expandable, if we find that we need to replace a handset due to damage or loss (remember those 3 teenagers?) or even add another line it will be a very simple and low-cost endeavor.

Comment just for the Seller:

Labels are formulated for laser in at least two important ways. First, the adhesive has a higher temperature capacity, so it doesn't melt inside the printer or copier. (Inkjet just sprays on the ink - does not heat up the paper surface at all).

Second, the surface area is specifically formulated to hold toner.

You KNOW that these labels are not formulated for laser ... so why would you market them that way??? If you had disclosed they are for inkjet only, I would give them 3 stars for being a decent generic/Avery knock-off.

But they are falsely advertised as laser safe. You get zero stars. You say the product is 100% guaranteed - are you going to pay our $180 repair bill on our laser printer? We'll see.

==========

Now onto the review...

Oh boy, these labels are a trip. We've ordered twice, got a different product both times. Never ordering again anything that says ""Americopy"" again.

The first time, the finish was more like a thermal label, somewhat glossy. I thought the finish looked nice & professional. They worked fine in inkjet, not so well in laser, but no major problems. A decent generic item.

However, the second time, the finish looked just like a normal piece of paper (like 20# bond copy paper). Almost as if they just sprayed adhesive on the back of it.

When you put the two next to each other, they don't even look manufactured by the same person. Very odd. The 1st style we used up in our inkjet printers, and worked fine. The 2nd type we used in our laser, and they are NOT working.

In our first laser printer, the toner just flaked right off. So we tried in our expensive laser printer (the first batch worked ok, not great, so we thought we'd give it a try).

The sheet LITERALLY melted and jammed up the entire works. We worked for hours to pull all the little stickers out of there. Ended up costing $180 repair bill.

Lowest score possible for the deceptive advertising.",4,8.788022

It is an intermittent problem but still very serious.  On an incoming call I would answer, hear the other party and then the call would drop, the screen would go blank.  If I tried to pick up the call again by pressing the talk button an error message would be displayed.  ""No Link To Base Check AC Connection""

I called their tech support dept and was told to remove the batteries and recharge the phones.  This ""trouble shooting"" procedure did not solve the problem.

On the positive side the voice quality on both ends is excellent and the speakerphone is equally high quality.  Obviously, there is a glitch in the design of this phone.

When the trouble shooting steps failed to resolve the problem, I notified Panasonic and they sent me out a refurbished replacement.  Same problem.  I notified them again.  They sent out a brand new replacement, same problem.

I called them this morning and they offered to upgrade me to the KX TG 6433.  I believe this may be a ""fixed"" version of the same model.  I will gladly give this a try.  I might also suggest for anyone needing to exchange these through Panasonic rather than Amazon that you give Panasonic a credit card and and ask them to send the replacement BEFORE you send in your defective unit.  Just be sure you send in your old unit within the allowed time to avoid your credit card being charged.

Like Jayk's, another reviewer here on Amazon, I've been a loyal Panasonic telephone customer for quite some time, in my case since the late 70's.  They have always had a superior product and stood behind their products.  I'm definitely willing to give them a chance to resolve the problems.  When they get it right their products are #1.  I have a background in the interconnect business so I'm very well aware of what's available on the market.

UPDATE 1/24/10: After over 6 months the KX TG 6433 has been absolutely flawless.  This new system is exactly what I wanted.  Excellent range, sound quality and feature set.  Panasonic has restored my faith in their excellent phones.  Every manufacturer hits a foul ball from time to time.  Evidently the 9333 was their foul ball.

1453,"I've had this phone for a couple of years now. I bought it for a home office hoping to get a two-line properly duplexing speaker phone that wouldn't have my coworkers and customers complaining about the sound quality I was getting with the Unicom that it replaced. It has met this requirement - most of the time. But there are times that it really misses the mark and you can't carry on a conversation with the speaker on.

The microphone has good pickup of my voice but is terrible at masking out background noise. The caller on the other end will hear everything in the room like they are sitting at your lap. There is insufficient gain control to even mute the sound of cars driving down the street with the window down.

The speaker sound quality is great but way too loud. Even on the lowest volume setting, it's much louder than my speaking voice. I usually end up putting something over the speaker to mute it to a tolerable level.

Using it with the handset is not good. The cord is too short and stiff. Sitting a reasonable distance from the phone pulls the base off the desk. I know you can purchase a longer, more resilient cord but at this price point you have the right to complain about the cheap, barely adequate one Polycom ships with the unit.

Like other reviewers here, I've found the LCD display to be at the wrong angle and it's not adjustable. You have to stand up and look down at it to read the display. The menu for reviewing Caller ID information is terrible. I'd like to know if the call came into my home line or business line but it's impossible. The phone directory for storing frequently called numbers is too hard to use.

I've all but given up using the speaker phone feature and bought a Plantronics wireless headset to use with it. The headset is fantastic. But with the phone cradle design on the Polycom Pro it's impossible to get a good fit for the handset lifter. It works, but you'll find yourself having to manually hang up the phone about 20% of the time.

My real problem with this phone is that the labels on every button I use have worn completely off. And I don't do a lot of calling with it as most calls are received.  The paint is very cheap and started coming off in the first couple of months. All but a few seldom used buttons are all anonymously black now.

Summary
I used this to teach my 5 year old how to properly hold a pencil.  It works OK, but I wish the grips were just a bit smaller to fit a 4 and 5 year old's fingers. They fit my fingers very well (adult with medium-large hands) and are very comfortable, but when my 5 year old holds them, there's too much wiggle room given that his hands are much smaller than mine.  Since it doesn't fit him very snug, I see that occasionally he holds the grip (and the pencil) with some other bizarre concoction of fingers. If I were trying to teach an adult how to hold a pencil properly, these would be great.  Or if I just wanted to have something that would make holding a pencil more comfortable, these would be great.  But as a teaching tool for little kids, these are not all that great.",2,6.187837

1469,"This was a transaction where I obtained the unit directly from the Magicjack company.  I have had the original mj for a little over a year. I received a ""special offer by email only available for a limited number of units."" First, I doubt that is anywhere near the truth. I just might have the US Attorney look at that marketing ploy. One of the things that I thought was good was that even though I would be losing about 6 months of service, I could keep my same mj number. NO WHERE DOES IT TELL YOU THAT IT WILL COST AN ADDITIONAL 19.95 TO DO THAT! I could understand that if it was another company or a land line, but this is their own company trying to get people to pay more for the same service (29.95 a year vs 19.95 a year).

I ordered this unit on 12/5 and received it today, 12/12 (I didn't opt for their ""expedited shipping"" and low and behold they shipped it two days later instead of the 2-3 weeks they said it would take to get it sent out). So they are lying again. I connected to their chat today and learned of the additional charge and wanted to know how to return it. I went to the site to get the RMA # and it said in order for a refund, it would have to be received by 12/26. That is 3 weeks, not 30 days as they say in their advertising. (chalk up another lie).

By the way, if you get it in the mail directly from Magicjack, be very careful how you open it. The UPC is part of the mailing label and if it is not intact, you can't return it. Just adds to the overall sleaziness of the company.

There are other companies with better customer service out there....use them as MJ could care less if you are a customer.

Finally, I have a friend that got the plus unit and it works no better than the original. This means sometimes you will not receive calls even though everything is suppose to be working (you are plugged in and on line) or it doesn't put through a call unless a number of attempts are made.

For anyone who bought the previous ones years ago, these ARE exactly the same aside from the packaging.  In the past they came in an actual package and these new ones just came on a piece of paper mailed to me.  Not a big deal but it can make people think they are different.

1476,"So far so good.  Arrived very promptly.  Fit in printer perfectly.  Working just fine.  With fingers crossed-- looks like I'm going to be saving a lot of $$ as a lifelong Miroo customer.  Share on you, HP, for $ gouging.

ABOUT 6 MONTHS LATER....
I had one large black cartridge that just wouldn't work... so smoke that one.  A third cartridge worked well, as did the first.

I can't say the about the color cartridges.  They produce a streaky, very inaccurate image.  Their ability to mix and make non-primary colors is poor.  End result looks like ... well like it ought to be in a modern art show and sell for big bucks.,  But in the mean time when I try to put a goo presentation together.... no one will rave about the end product.  I will stick with Miroo for the blacks... but colors will likely have to be the bad guys and their highway-robbery prices.

I tried the Instant Ink program from HP... for one day.  Like a bad car lease, after >100 pp they were dunning me with emails about me going over limit but if I upgraded my subscription all would be swell in mudville.

My brief experience with the Miroo customer service people has been great.  And it wouldn't surprise me to see them respond to this and make good on the bad cartridge.  I'll certainly give them the chance.

UPDATE - 8/26/16:  The customer service people have been bending over backwards to please me,... just sent a new/fresh replacement set.  The color cartridges are still producing dark, smudged, streaky results.  (I have an HP 8620).  As much as I HATE paying HP their ridiculous prices, I just ordered a set of ""genuine"" cartridges.  There are positive reviews for this product and I hope you get those kinds of results.  But there are quite a few others that are as disappointed as I am.  I would give them one star... because I've wasted my $45.  But Alice at Customer Service gets a star on her own.

Good luck and caveat emptor!",10,6.369887
1477,"I have been using my ScanSnap s1300i for about a month now and it works great.  The first week I tried it on a couple of sheets cut from a Handyman magazine that I found crumpled up in the bottom of a brief case.  I ironed the thin sheets and stuck them in and it scanned them just fine.  Today, I scanned 23 ballots ripped off the bottom of a dues letter with relatively uneven and some folded lead edges, and of varying sizes and it scanned them all just fine.  I keep lots of documents for our Homeowners Association on line to improve communications.  This scanner has made that process so much easier.  The pdf's that are generated are excellent.  The dual sided scanning works great.  The document manager allows you to look at the pdf and delete any sides that were included that you did not want (like ads on the back of meaningful pages cut from a magazine) or flip pages that you put in incorrectly.  It takes up one fifth the desk space of my flatbed so it is something that I can keep on top rather than creating some special place for it.
An excellent product.
Ok, been using it for another month and still love it. Today my wife asked me for a copy of a grocery receipt.  I stuck the receipt in and when it read it the receipt skewed at a 45 degree angle.

1481,"After getting this printer set up, including printing the alignment page, I tested the copier function by copying a document with a little bit of color to see how it would come out. I wasn't paying attention while it was printing and didn't see the result until the entire page had printed out: covered entirely in dark purple ink that saturated the page. I was horrified, thinking of all the ink that had been wasted!  So I tried it a couple more times but watched the early printing so I could see if the same thing was happening. It was, so I canceled the print right away.

When I printed a document from the computer it worked fine. Then I tried scanning something. The image that appeared on the computer monitor had a purple tint over the entire frame.  Apparently something was wrong with the scanner.

I went to the Canon web site and e-mailed support. Given that Canon is such a huge company, and with many of my past experiences with other large (and not-so-large) companies, I really wasn't expecting any sort of reply very soon, certainly not the same day.  First came one of those automated replies letting me know my inquiry had been received. Well, that happens frequently but its the follow-up that is usually lacking. To my surprise, however, I received a response in about an hour or maybe a little more, from a real person, who actually addressed my problem specifically and not in some lame, generic way.

As we e-mailed back and forth, he concluded that the printer was defective and told me that they would be sending another one to me and when I received it, to send back the defective one. They would supply me with a prepaid UPS label. My correspondence with them began in the evening; the next morning they shipped the replacement!

Wow. I can't believe I received such good response from a giant corporation like Canon. Not only that, but the responses were intelligently written.  The guy also gave me explicit instructions for switching between old and new printers (since they were not immediately swappable, due in part to my having set it up for wireless use).

The new printer arrived. A plus was they told me to not send back the ink or print head, or any of the accessories that came with it, just the main unit itself. So I got some free ink out of this exchange, too. I'd really like to give kudos to the service I received.

Now about the printer itself: It looks very nice. I like the black gloss finish (even though it shows fingerprints) and it came very nicely packaged, with soft plastic strips all around, protecting the finish. The LCD panel in the middle of the cover is nice and bright, and the touch-sensitive controls work beautifully.

Setup: Make sure to read the directions carefully and just follow what it says to the letter. If you do that, you won't have any problems. Some of it is not all that intuitive, so just follow the instructions. They are clear and well illustrated. There are separate sections for setting it up with a USB cable, wireless, or with an ethernet cable. I set mine up for wireless use. The easy setup worked fine; it detected the network signal, latched on after I entered by passcode, and it prints and communicates flawlessly.

Print/copy/scan quality: I think it is very fine, especially for a printer of this price. The colors from the scan appear to be accurate. The print quality is great. Two things, though, it does not have a feeder so you have to copy or scan things one by one; and, like all ink printers it uses a lot of ink. I think that first page from the broken printer that used up a whole page of ink and was dark purple took a lot of ink out of the cartridges. A nice feature of this printer is it shows you on the LCD panel how much ink remains in each of the 6 cartridges. I see that some of them only have half left and I hardly printed anything (but that error page used a lot - way more than a normal photo).

Ease of use: You can use the well-lit and easy to navigate LCD panel and touch buttons on the cover, or use the software that comes with the printer. They are both pretty easy to use. The only ""con"" is that when you run setup, it also sets the various software programs to load into memory when the computer is started. I prefer minimal programs on startup so I removed them from the startup list. The only drawback to this is when I want to use the printer to scan something I have to open the software program.

You can also print from multiple computers, as long as they are all in the network. I set up my wife's computer and that went fine.

All in all, I am pleased with this printer. I know replacement ink cartridges are going to be expensive, but then name a printer whose ink isn't.. that's how the companies make their profits. At least this one is a very attractive unit, the build quality seems good, and the production quality is good as well. And the Canon's support also gets a thumbs up.

1485,"My older Brother monochrome laser MFC is on its last legs with regard to its drum, and I've been waiting for Brother to come out with a simple monochrome laser printer with true Google Cloud Print support to replace it with, since I have another MFC I use now.  When I saw this printer hit the market I knew it was the one for me.  Boy, was I WRONG!  The print quality is noticeably worse than my MFC with its dying drum, but print quality via Google Cloud Print (GCP) is much worse.  GCP is easy to setup, but the printer only supports ONE content type via GCP - image/pwg-raster, at terribly low resolution (it MIGHT be 300 dpi, but it looks lower).  Print quality is horrible when printing via GCP.  In comparison, my old MFC, which I print to via Google's Cloud Print connector service for Windows, produces much better results.

I contacted Brother about this, but naturally they tell me it's a Google issue.  I contact Google about it and... oh wait, you can't contact Google about much of anything.

Update: after spending several hours chatting with Brother support, multiple attempts at firmware updates, and my own testing, I've come to the conclusion that this is how Brother intends for this printer to operate, and that they have no intention of fixing it because they don't believe there's anything wrong.  I've decided to return this printer and spend the money on a replacement drum for my MFC instead.  In doing so I'll lose duplex printing, but at least the output will look like it came from a laser printer instead of a dot matrix printer from last century.",21,8.826558

1487,"We bought two of these (or at least a very similar model) at Target for about $32 each. We were expecting some flaws and flimsiness issues, but we were really surprised. The finish on both of our file cabinets is flawless. The drawers work fine and I love the tall sides. We're not worried about locking our household records, so we have no issue with the lock, which seems fine for keeping casual snoopers or small children from opening the drawers.

As another reviewer said, the height is perfect for our printer. We put the printer on top of the side-by-side cabinets, and that arrangement has the added advantage of making sure the file cabinets don't tip if we happen to overload the top drawer and pull it all the way out (which is not a good idea for any file cabinet!).

The empty cabinets are quite lightweight but NOT flimsy. They were easy to carry up to our second-floor condo. The handles were pretty easy to attach, once I figured out that I should tighten the screw while it was flush against the inside of the drawer  (I'm not very mechanically minded!); the second, third and fourth handles were easy, once I learned that trick. The drawers and cabinet are squared to each other; the fit is excellent.

To sum up: These are a great value. They look good.  We recommend them without reservation.

1488,"What's paper cutter good for?  Straight cut lines.

Why only 3 stars for this paper cutter?  Lines, while clean aren't perfectly straight.

Using this paper cutter to make clean lines in our daughter's school photos (getting all those wallet photos apart), this paper cutter immediately displayed 2 cons and one pro.  So here they are:

Pros:
-Lines on a fresh blade were clean and smooth on both photo and plain paper, one sheet at a time.
-Compact. This is a compact cutter, big enough for trimming an 8x10"" photo but too small for legal or constuction paper on the long edge.

Cons:
-Not immediately evident where the cut line will be.  This makes lining up a cut more difficult than it should be.
-Cuts are not perfectly straight even when using the paper clamp.  I'm not sure why cuts  like this.  On multiple photos where lines were easy to see, the cuts were acceptable but not perfect.  Perfect cut lines is what a paper cutter is for right?

Summary:
This is a nice home-use paper cutter that is sized right for most applications, and it has features to boot, like a paper clamp and blade storage.  It is debatable whether replaceable blades are more home-user friendly than a large knife like blade but the fact that cuts aren't pefect is the real drawback here.  Are they pretty good and will it do in most circusmstances? Yes, but people should know what they are signing up for in advance.",8,10.21587
1489,"In the past I've had problems trying to use refilled ink cartridges for printers, no matter what the brand. I even had some refilled at an office store for my current HP printer and had to take them back. I don't know what any of these companies are doing differently now but I am very pleasantly surprised to find they work, and they work well. Yes, my printer does tell me I am using a ""non standard"" ink cartridge, but, they show ""full"". Why did I take off a star? Because it seems to take too many test print cycles to get clean colors. I only had to replace the blue (cyan) cartridge at this time, and the first 6 or 7 test prints came out with the ""yellow"" test patch looking very green, and the ""magenta"" turned out purple. I could see with each successive test that it was sort of cleaning out and by the last one I had a perfect test print showing the proper colors. I don't feel I should have to keep running the test print to clear up color bleed or whatever it was doing. Otherwise these are a very good inexpensive alternative to name brand printer cartridges.

1494,"Excellent pens, but not without flaws.

First of all, I am considering the fact that you can get sets of 48 pens for $10 at the local hobby stores.  Sometimes on sale for less.

Second of all, I am considering that gel pens run out fast!  By their very nature, they are dumping a lot of ink fast.

That makes this an expensive set.  I would highly recommend Sakura and Gelly Roll pens, but it might be worth it to buy smaller packs with the colors you really need.  The reason I say that is there are some colors in this set that may not be useful to many artists or - in my case - colorists.  ;-)  My daughter and I color together and we use some of the more adult coloring books (art, patterns, intricate animal details, etc...) and the colors with silver or gold mixed in with them aren't as useful, but make up a large portion of the set.

Also, this set does have the color chart (that you fill in yourself) included with it, which is GREAT, but could also be better.  The colors are numbered confusingly and with very small lettering.  Still, you find this almost nowhere else with gel pens so it is a plus.

Overall, I haven't found a brand I like better, and I've tried a few.  Fiskars aren't even close.

In the end, I'd say definitely get Gelly Roll Pens, but this set may or may not be the way to go...  And if you are just toying around, it is far, far less expensive to buy the 48 color sets for $10 and just buy another set when they run out.  It would take ten sets to get even close to this price!

P.S.  I uploaded a picture of the pens with a color chart to try and help you see the colors it comes with and what I am talking about with the silver and gold colors.",162,9.747642

The push button lock works OK, but there are quite a few plastic parts involved, which I'm concerned could break.  The biggest potential issue that buyers need to be aware of is that the metal on this safe is not that thick.  The picture with the locking prongs leads one to believe that this is a safe on par with the old fashioned ones made out of thick steel.  That's not the case here.  Even if bolted down someone could break into it fairly easily with a hammer and screwdriver.  The security provided by this safe is mostly psychological (i.e. everyone knows it's a no-no to try to break into someone else's safe, even if it's not that hard to get into).

Its been about 9 months now and i'm afraid I must knock this review down a few stars for the following reasons:
1) 10-10-2016: The chair has begun to become unstable and wobbles side to side slightly.
2) 10-12-2016: The arm rests have completely come apart and now just hang on the metal support that screws onto the bottom of the chair. I took it apart only to find that the welds on both sides of the arm rests have come apart. Luckily, I have a welder and can repair it.
3) 11-28-2016: The chair now gave way on the reclining portion of it. Same reason as the arm rests. The weld came apart.
4) 1-2-2017:  Last straw, the fabric, particularly near the zipper, has now started to pull apart where it is attached to the zipper.

Overall, I really liked this chair but it started to fall apart all of a sudden and the welding job was not done correctly. I am a full-time student and sat in this chair constantly but I expected this chair to last longer than 9 months.

**************************************************************************************************
This chair is really comfortable and seems durable. Extremely easy to assemble and it comes with the tools to do it yourself without any additional tools required. Everything screws on with just 8 Allen head screws. The seat glides no problem on carpet and the lumbar support is top notch and essential for this gaming chair. The reclining positions is what is impressive. It can be adjusted similar to a car chair and folds all the way down, so whatever position and reclining angle you are used to, this gaming chair can definitely accommodate. Additionally, it comes with an authentic serial number tiny plaque to commemorate your purchase.

The only real downside to this gaming chair are the armrests. They are a bit shorter in length than I expected. So if you are used to having a reclining position at all times then your arms might not be supported by the arm rests.

Pros:
Easy to assemble.
Lumbar support and head rest already come attached.
Durable and less expensive than the DX racer models.
Multiple reclining positions.

Cons:
Short arm rests.

Overall, this gaming chair is durable and really nice at about half the price of other gaming chairs. If you are in the market for a bucket seat gaming chair then look no further if you would like a comfortable, sturdy, and stylish chair at a bargain compared to the competition.

1507,"I've never used a Dymo label maker before. So I gave the 260p a shot when it showed up on Vine.

Right off the bat, the 260P fits well in my palm, my right thumb resting naturally on the label cutting button. I'm left-handed, so it suits me fine to hold in the off-hand. For righties who also want to hold it off-handed, it's a tough more awkward to reach that cutter button. I use my middle finger. It isn't heavy at all, and both the label cassette and the battery compartment are easily accessible on the bottom, complete with studs so you can set it safely on a tabletop.

For all the buttons, it takes less than five minutes to figure it out. The format key has everything you need to set up the label, including a choice of a san serif, bold serif, and light serif font. All of the glyphs are accessed by their own key bindings. Numbers and letters have their own keys, accented characters are selected simply by activating the accent mode, and two-line typing is a simple as hitting ""Return"". Almost every option is just two key presses away, plus the directional pad to scroll through any lists. The commands are consistent, with dedicated ""cancel"" and ""OK"" buttons.

It offers plenty of sensible options. The memory accommodates up to nine labels, including all formatting. The unit itself is full of clip art and symbols and borders. You can print multiple copies, and there is a backwards text option in the format menu for putting transparent labels in windows or glass, or to reflect in mirrors.

A few problems. There is no ""Shift"" key. Just a ""Caps"" that you have to toggle back and forth. The keyboard is not Qwerty layout. I find the keys to be pretty stiff, and it can be easy not to register if you aren't paying attention. The up arrow of the D-pad seemed particularly numb to me.

Battery powered only, it's a portable option for running around the garage or bake sale. My complaint here is the same as other reviewers--the AC power adaptor cable only recharges the battery and does not provide power to the unit itself. The power pack itself is unique to the unit, loading a pair of not-very-common 14430 lithium ion cells inside, so once it goes bad you can't just pop over to your local store. The unit itself runs on 7.4 volts, so a future design couldn't just load up a couple of double AAs in its place; CR123s or a 9-volt battery might be good options. Of course, the unit itself might not last much longer than its current battery--we'll just have to see.

The unit uses standard Dymo label cassettes. It's not terribly noisy when it prints, though occasionally the glyphs don't always print completely. The text is also a bit pixilated, especially on curves and with the serif fonts, but the labels are very readable at 24 points from across the room, and they haven't picked up a lot of glare. I appreciate that the device leaves only about a half-inch margin of label on either side of the text, but I think it could do one better and trim it down to a quarter. I'm also unsure as to how long the labels will last before they peel away or fade.

We all have been so shocked by the news.  Therefore, I called myself to verify and the Mont Blanc store have confimed me that this is the FAKE pen, not a legimate authentificate MontBlanc pen, over the phone.

1509,"I have been using the printer for over four months, so I have a good feel for the performance.  I got it as part of package when buying a Windows laptop for my kids.  The printer is running exclusively wirelessly, and the performance has been outstanding.

Setup:  I first set up with my Macbook, then with the Windows laptop.  Had to connect with the included usb cable initially, and had no issues recognizing my wireless network.  Setup on the Windows machine was then doene wirelessly, with no problems.

Printing:  It just works. Reasonably quiet, and the printing is quite fast.  No complaints at all.

Fax:  Who has a landline anymore?

Scanning: This where the product shines for me.  I do a LOT of scanning of multi-page documents, and the 4500 has been flawless.  Many folks I send these to remark how clear the PDF's look.  The machine is worth it for this alone.

My kids also have no problem printing or scanning from where they use their laptop on a different floor from where the printer is located.  Overall, I don't think the value of the HP 4500 can be beat.",2,6.720782

It gives a more comfortable grip for the fingers and kind of screams out luxury at the same time. The pen is of solid construction. It uses a gel rolling ball refill which is better than ordinary rollerball pens because it doesn't use straight liquid ink which could leaf or echo to the other side of the page. The writing is smoother than any other type of pen I've used, gel or otherwise, and closely compares to top-notch fountain pens when it comes to smoothness. The lines it creates on paper are very deep in color and bold to some extent so that your writing stands out on the page.

All I can say is that you spend your money on a pens that costs up to 10x as much and they still won't write as well as these pens....and this is coming from a calligrapher who has been doing this for over 30 years of experience.",5,8.014105

The portability of the product was extremely helpful, since I can just slide it into my backpack and take it wherever I need to go.  The plastic seemed a little flimsy, but I didn't have any issues with it, and I assume they were trying to make it light.  I would recommend this to anyone who uses their laptops without a desk on a regular basis.

Unsealing and installing these cartridges require just a little bit of care since the cartridges can drip a couple of ink drops if you're not careful.

For over 5 years, Canon printers have been my brand of choice.  My friends and colleges who followed my advice and went with Canon printers have generally been very pleased.  It seems like my friends/colleges with HP printers tend to have more problems with installation and getting the wi-fi to work.

1523,"The 2200 produces beautiful prints and enlargements -- if you take the time to learn how to use it and follow all the rules.
Use the papers Epson recommends for this specific printer. Go through the options available in the printer software.  And it helps enormously to calibrate your monitor using a colorimeter rather than than less precise Adobe Gamma applet that comes bundled with Photoshop and Photoshop Elements.  (Amazon offers Pantone/ColorVision PhotoCal and OptiCal ""prosumer"" and pro calibrating packages at good prices, but this adds to the cost.)
I use it with digital files from a 5 megapixel camera edited in Photoshop Elements on an LCD monitor calibrated with PhotoCal, and have been delighted with the results. The color rendition is accurate and the detail is comparable to a commercial print.  The 2200 stands apart from it's nearest competitor, the Canon i9100, because the inks promise to deliver very long life, comparable to a commercial print.  But.. it's also slower than the Canon, and more expensive.
For amateurs, I suppose the 2200 is overkill with its 13 x 19 inch capability.  After all, how often will we make prints larger than 8 x 10?  Will we be around in 75 years to verify that the prints haven't faded?  Wouldn't it be less expensive to bring the files for those prints to a photo processor?  Sure it would, but how much fun is that?",13,14.122719

1544,"I've been using Mont Blanc pens for a six or eight years now, and the first point I should make is this - let's be honest, nobody is going to buy or use one of these pens because they are the value proposition. They are like a piece of jewelry, or a Rolex watch, that you use as much for the impression it makes as for the quality of the pen itself.

You put the pen in your pocket, you use it and then set it down on the conference table during a meeting, and the appearance of the pen is unmistakable. The white Montblanc star emblem at the top of the pen is the trademark and is intended to 'represent the snow-covered peak of the Mont Blanc - the highest European mountain'. It makes a statement.

Now, with that said, is also happens to be a fine pen, and if you have invested the money in purchasing the pen in the first place (or it has been given to you as a gift, which makes it more difficult), then the cost of the refills is just something that you end up accepting as part of the cost of maintaining that image, if you will.

And I will also say this - I've tried the cheaper refills, and they do not write as well, they do not feel as smooth when writing with them, and overall I would not use them with my Mont Blanc pen. I know this because a few years ago, my admin assistant at work, when asked to order refills for my pen, decided to save a few dollars and get me the 'generic' equivalent. So I used them, and I don't like them. They did not write smoothly, and they did not write evenly. I'll spend my own money for the real thing, or if I decide that it is not worth the expense to me then I'll just revert to a less expensive pen and not worry about it.

These are the real Mont Blanc refills, they are not cheap but I think they are competitively priced, and they work perfectly with the pen. The price is equivalent to what you pay if you go to Mont Blanc's website and order them there. They are made with a high quality - the metal screws into the pen with precision and fits perfectly - and they write smoothly and exceptionally well from the very first stroke of the pen.

I don't try to keep track of how long they last. Again, it's one of those things - 'if you have to ask, you can't afford it'. I'm not saying that applies to me in all cases, but for now, and when I want to use my 'good' pen, then it is worth it to me.",5,13.350763

1564,"I bought this recently and I have to say that I was incredibly disappointed. Aside from very obvious scratches, chipped gold tone on the rings, some minor rips inside the planner and the fact that one of the monthly tabs was not laminated like the rest, I found this planner to be decidedly ho-hum. PLEASE NOTE that even though it's described as gold foil, this is only true of the front cover - everything else is like a bad photocopy of gold foil, which ends up just looking kind of mustard yellow. What I also found very disappointing was the fact that only every 3rd or 4th monthly divider actually has a printed sentiment, meaning that  about 2/3 of the monthly dividers have no sayings or statements on them. Of course you could just add it yourself but I was really looking for something a little more fun.

As others may already have noted, the covers are NOT hardcover - they're just laminated cardstock or lighweight cardboard I think, definitely not super sturdy but will do the trick if you don't plan on taking it with you anywhere in a bag/purse/backpack. If you get this for college, I highly recommend leaving it on your desk because it will definitely NOT withstand daily ""abuse"".

I've used a variety of planners, ranging from Filofax to Kate Spade, DayRunner to MemoryDock, through Lilly Pulitzer, Sakroots, Vera Bradley etc. I also have a Heidi Swapp planner, which quite frankly is definitely a little nicer than this one. I found the content to be decidedly lackluster - the setup is great and the space is great, but then the colors are mostly so muted and boring that it makes you almost fall asleep as you flip through the planner. The pages are also thinner than I had hoped, leading me to believe that any pens/markers will leave markings on the back of the page and possibly even bleed through to another page.

I love this idea and concept, but the execution failed to wow me. I'd rather pay an extra $10 for a Lilly Pulitzer jumbo planner that at least comes with full gloss hard covers, a full sheet of stickers and an attached elastic band.",11,7.736935

When we took it out of the box, it was immediately obvious that he bin is made differently than in previous models.  Where before it was sturdy plastic, it now is folded and pinned composition with unfinished edges on the bottom that are bound to catch and bend with the frequent removal and return necessary to empty the bags.  When running, the bin door would not stay shut but popped open from the shuddering of the machine.  We tried it with the previous, high quality bin, which worked slightly better but still popped open.  The comparison with our previous model is stark.  That one is sturdy and reliable.  This one cannot be used and is being returned.  It's a shame because the previous product was very good and a real workhorse for us.

I have called customer support, they were little or not help.  I got it working after some hours (initial start up) using my own ingenuity and experience.  Now, for the 5th time, it will not print, saying it has ""print head problems"", but there is no way to fix them, apparently.  Also, in doing on line research I find that if a cartridge is removed from the machine for over 30 minutes, it could ruin the machine and the cartridge both.  Does that make any sense?  I have not done that, but that's a warning for readers that is buried deep in the trouble shooting guides. I have the ""Instant Ink"" option and the telephone staff managing that are nice, and competent, unlike those on the hardware help line.  They have shipped a far amount of ""instant ink"" but often only 1 cartridge in a box, followed the next day by a box of 2 cartridges. They waste much postage by now just sending a set at one time.  The glossy prints (when I can get it to work) are a bit dark, and lesser quality than my Canon that sits right beside it.  However, on bright white, ink jet photo paper (inexpensive) it does a great job.  Used as a copy machine it makes better copies than it makes prints from digital photo files.

1583,"When I discovered FriXion pens, I almost lost my mind with joy. I spent time creating the perfect undated planner that I would only have to print once. At the end of the year, I would take a hairdryer to it and erase it all and start over. The pens work very well, so I had the same high hopes for these markers. And they work--kind of.

You can erase the marker, but the pressure required to fully erase it actually warped the paper. I thought to myself that I would just erase the marker ink with the hairdryer. (It wouldn't help with the precision that I'd hoped to get from the eraser, but that's okay.) I hit it with the hairdryer, and it disappeared--sort of. I'm attaching a picture of the paper once it was erased. You can still see the color names I wrote and the hearts I drew. The pinks and oranges seem to leave behind the most residual color.

I had planned to use these to color code my planner. I was also going to let the 3 year old give them a go since they will easily be removed from walls, doors, and whatever else she decides to ""make pretty.""

1584,"I went from a very annoying 5 yo HP ink jet printer to the Pimxa 4000. It is a startling transition; printers have evolved far faster than computers in the past five years.

Other reviewers will comment on images, etc. Suffice to say they are extraordinary, you must use Canon papers and inks, etc etc. Here are some points that you may not read elsewhere.

1. It's a 50 MB driver installation for XP, about 30MB for OS X! Both drivers are complex. I also installed the borderless printing package on my G3 iBook, but it's too slow to be useable. It's also as ugly as Canon's other OS X software. It's an OS 9 app that's been tweaked to run ""native"" in OS X; I wonder if it uses some proprietary emulation layer. I suspect the OS 9 version of the same package might be faster.

The XP custom install doesn't really let you choose where to put things. The html documentation, for example, ends up in the WINDOWS directory. Weird.

2. They say this is a ""5 color"" printer, but two of them are black. Marketing!

3. I almost returned this when the other PIXMAS (5000, etc) came to the US market. On review though, this holds up well. The higher numbered PIXMAs below $200 US mostly have unnecessary gizmos. One of them IS a better photo printer (6 inks), but it seems to be ONLY a photo printer. I need something the kids can print color documents on. There's a $300 PIXMA that is clearly superior (7 colors, 2 black) but it's more than I wanted to spend.

4. Most ink jet printers should be used at least weekly, if not every 3-4 days, to keep the nozzles in fine shape. I don't know if that will be true of the PIXMA.

5. This is NOT a simple device. It's not trivial to setup or to use. I would not recommend it for someone who's not a photo geek or fond of studying manuals.

6. There's no way Canon is making any money on this printer. Clearly their margin is on the supplies.

7. Color management is a very dark and extremely misunderstood area. This printer did a plausible job rendering images taken by a Canon camera, processed on a Mac and printed from an XP machine (sRGB profiles on Mac). On the other hand my iBook prints were too yellow. I switched to using ColorSync to control the printing from my iBook. That dramatically slowed printing but produced more plausible colors. I'm still working with this, but I'm currently getting better color results printing from my XP machine than my iBook -- even though all my photos are managed on my iBook.

9. It has a parallel port as well as the USB cable. That seems a bit odd. I can't imagine a machine with power enough to use this printer that wouldn't have a USB cable.

10. I had trouble doing borderless printing. Eventually I figured out the various complexities of print orientation, image size, etc. I can do borderless printing from Adobe Photoshop Elements and from iPhoto and Graphic Converter. It is quite tricky to set up all the various driver configurations however.",299,13.849048
1585,"The only reason I didn't give this product five stars is because I found the tips to use it properly in my Prismacolor pencils.

From the Tips and Techniques sheet in the Prismacolor Premier Colored Pencils: ""Hold the pencil steady in your left hand and use your right hand to turn the sharpener clockwise around the pencil. Minimizing torque will help achieve a sharp point with minimal breakage.""

1587,"First, the most important point: The Pixma Pro-10 makes the most stunning prints we have ever seen from an ink jet printer. Put one of these prints in a frame with a big price tag, and nobody will question the quality. Here are the details:

QUALITY:
This printer replaced a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Canon-Pixma-iX6520/dp/B004HO58VQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Canon Pixma iX6520</a>&nbsp;large format inkjet printer, which in turn had replaced an&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Epson-WorkForce-1100/dp/B002HREI0C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Epson WorkForce 1100</a>&nbsp;large format printer. As you would expect for a printer costing about three times as much, the output Pixma Pro-10 puts the other two to shame. Specifically, the color reproduction is gorgeous across the full gamut, thanks to all the extra ink colors (10 in all!). Blacks are black as night, like the Pixma iX6520, thanks to the black dye and black ink cartridges. Red and green are brilliant. Colors are never ""muddy"" or indistinct.

SPEED:
The Pro-10 is the slowest printer of the three, by a considerable margin. Some prints take 5-10 minutes depending on quality and media settings. If you need a speedy printer, look elsewhere, but recognize you may be sacrificing significant quality for that speed. We want quality; speed is not relevant to us.

MEDIA:
We tested the Pro-10 with several different high-quality inkjet photo stocks from HP and Canon, plus&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inkpress-Rag-Cool-Tone-Double-Sided-Bright-White-Matte-Inkjet-Paper-24-mil-300gsm-13x19-25-Sheets/dp/B000CS9BKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inkpress Rag, Cool Tone Double Sided, Bright White Matte Inkjet Paper, 24 mil., 300gsm, 13x19"", 25 Sheets</a>. The Pro-10 came with a sample of Canon's Luster stock, which is simply stunning. One reason is that the Pro-10 includes a clear-coat ink cartridge which it uses on glossy stock to make the colors really pop. We are ordering boxes of Canon's Luster and matte stocks in 13x19 to test, and if the 8x10 Luster sample was any indication, we're going to love it.

WIFI:
The Pixma Pro-10 has the WPS button to simplify WiFi networking. I used it with the button on the router to automatically connect the two devices. This worked fine for a week, then the connection got dropped. The Pro-10 is in the same room with the router, not far from an&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Epson-WorkForce-845-All-in-One/dp/B005IVL0RS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Epson WorkForce 845 All-in-One</a>&nbsp;that is our every-day printer. The Epson is also wireless and hasn't lost its connection in more than a year. So the Canon wireless connection seems a bit less reliable at this time. The Pro-10 prints fine with a USB cable even when the WiFi driver cannot be found.

PHYSICAL:
The Pro-10 is very heavy and very large. Check out the product specs and plan your installation accordingly. We had been using a small table in a corner for the Pixma iX6520, but needed a larger table for the Pro-10.

SUMMARY:
The best quality inkjet we've ever seen, bar none. Prints are also superior to all of the dye sublimation samples we could find. I would normally deduct a half star for the wifi issue described above, but since Amazon only allows 4 or 5 stars, the Pro-10 clearly merits 5 stars. Speed is not an issue for us, we would happily wait even longer for prints this good. Highly recommended if it fits your budget.",2,12.275302

1590,"I am a PDA fanatic.  Actually, it's a illness.  I've owned ten PDAs and I must say that I love my Zire 71 best out of all of them--Pocket PC or Palm.
Let me state this now--you will NOT find a PDA that sports a built-in digital camera at this price.  Granted, it's not a megapixel camera, but it's good enough for websites and to take pics of possible gift items and bring home to your spouse for review.  It's not a necessity in a PDA, but it's a very nice convenience, and it actually does come in handy for those times when you wouldn't have a camera on you.
As for more realistic uses, I didn't have any problems inputting phone numbers, memos, creating Word and Excel files (I bought Docs to Go separately), or listening to MP3s.  Everything went smoothly and without pauses or glitches.
Here are some of the minor qualms I first had with my Zire 71, but quickly got over.  Learning Graffiti 2 stinks once you've gotten used to the original Graffiti, but for new Palm owners, it won't be a problem.  The Real audio player works fine, but without any equalizer settings, you would probably opt for a 3rd party MP3 player (like I did), and the bundled Kinoma Producer for the PC lacks quality settings that you would need to play high-res movies (so you'll have to buy it separately, if you want better quality).  Again, all small problems.  I'm just picky.
What I like about it:
-Beautiful, crisp color display (even better than my Clies)
-Built-in MP3 playback (Can also play video with Kinoma Player)
-Zippy TI OMAP processor (Makes my Clie SJ30 seem like a snail)
-Built-in digital camera
-Cool slide open design
-Takes SD cards to store pictures, MP3s, video clips, etc.
What I don't like:
-Back housing is a fingerprint magnet! (I hate fingerprints!)
-Isn't able to download pics from my Casio wrist camera or my Nokia 3650 phone.  (IR problem or OS 5.1?  I think it's OS 5.1)
-Huge, brick-like cradle/AC adapter
Okay, my only serious complaint was the compatibility issues with my phone and watch.  Other than that, this is an awesome PDA that will fit the needs of any working professional, student, or techno-geek.
So I give it a 4-star rating, only because it's not compatible with my phone and watch, even though all my other Palm OS 4 devices and Pocket PC devices had no problems with either.  As a side note, I own a Japanese Sony Clie PEG-TJ25, which uses Palm OS 5.2, and it works with my watch and phone, so it might be an OS 5.1 issue (or is it just because I bought it in Japan?), which is why I'll keep my 4-star rating.",5,10.893124
1591,"This is by far the worst printer I have ever owned. I have had it for barely 2 months and it is no longer working. The scanner stopped functioning after a month. Then the copier went out. And now the printer won't even turn on! You have to have a separate outlet to provide enough power to run t he printer in the first place. Heaven forbid you need to use an extension cord or surge protector bar. If you can't plug it directly into the wall - Forget about it! The paper does not feed properly no matter what. And to top it off...I can't get it fixed. The nearest Canon repair is over 2 hours away and as far as mailing it back and forth to Canon and paying their fees it is cheaper to invest in a new one - I used to love Canon products but after the last two lemons (this one and the MP360) that I got from them - I will be looking elsewhere!

I gave it 2 stars in my original review because it did print nicely when it was working. With this edited review it won't let me change the amount of stars I gave it but I give it ZERO.

1593,"This is a good printer for the money. I'm pleased with the quality of text, and the quality when using ""toner save mode."" I teach as an adjunct professor (i.e., part-time) in a graduate program, and do a lot of printing of handouts, Keynotes, worksheets, and such, for students. So, I want a decent, readable quality of print. I'm not doing true desktop publishing, so I can't say how it works for that.

I do want to caution - this printer can be networked, but it's not inherently wireless. It CAN be used as a wireless printer if your wireless router allows you to plug in a network printer - my wireless router is Apple's Airport Extreme. This printer functions perfectly as a wireless printer via the Airport.

I really dislike it when a printer decides I'm out of ink as opposed to letting me make the decision that the print is becoming spotty, and yet, so many printers do this. There is a solution.

Some people have made comments that this printer burns through toner. Months ago, I read an Amazon review for a similar printer; the reviewer had pointed out that the codes on toner cartridges can be re-set. I saved that item in my Wish List so I'd be able to find that review. When this printer told me I was out of black toner (after about 400 copies) I looked up the review and re-set the code on my toner cartridge. I probably got another 500 copies out of that cartridge (yes, I had to tip it back and forth a couple of times to get even distribution). I ended up with MORE than acceptable use for a starter cartridge. So, I don't anticipate toner use being a problem with this printer.

1597,"I remember when a laser printer was way too expensive to consider for your average home, let alone color one.  So I bought this, the least expensive color laser printer I could find. I've had this printer for about a week now and it has worked just beautifully. I'm feeling smugly happy about what I think is a great buy.

Background: For simplicity, I have only Apple stuff in my house: iPhone 5S, iPhone 6 & 6S, two 2013 MacBooks, a 2010 MacBook Pro, and a 2009 iMac. I have Xfinity for my internet service.

Set Up: Easy. I followed the instructions included with the printer and on the printer's display. One thing, there is a lot of orange tape outside and inside that needs to be removed. I was afraid I'd miss one and mess up the printer.

WiFi:  The wifi setup came down to just two steps for me. As I ran through the setup sequence on the printer's display, step one, I had to push the WPS button on my Xfinity router and then, once the printer connected itself, step two, add the printer to my printers & scanners on my Apple devices. Now my whole family prints from all over the house. I haven't had any problems with bringing it online if it's idle for a while, like overnight. It does go into an energy save mode and takes maybe 30 seconds (rough guess) to get going again.

Firmware: Using just the printer's display, I immediately updated the printer's firmware. (I'm wondering if not updating the firmware may be causing some of the problems found by other reviewers).

Drivers and Manuals: I didn't use the CD that came with the printer. I'm not sure it would have worked on my Mac anyway. I went straight to Canon's website to register my printer ([...]). Once done, I downloaded the latest e-manual and also the latest drivers for the printer and scanner.  Once installed on my computer (I've only put it on the MacPro because I use it the most), I went to my computer's SystemsPreferences>Printes&Scannersr>Options&Supplies>ShowPrinterWebsite. Then used the ToPortal link on the website (upper right corner) to change settings for the printer (like default print tray, the type of paper, the density/intensity of the print, etc.). Although you can also change the settings on the printer display, this was easier.  The manual is a little cryptic and minimalist. I accessed it by opening the index.html file in the e-manual folder that I downloaded. Then it brings up a home page with a menu/Table of contents and search box for whatever information you're looking for.

Printing: Some reviews have complained about the print quality. I did find that the initial print quality was a little light. I'm not sure if it's the cheap paper I use but using the printer portaI, I increased the density by 1 and it looks great. You can specifically adjust quite a lot of things actually, for example if you want more yellow. (You can do this from the printer display too). It's so quiet compared to my previous Canon InkJet, my kids keep asking me if their stuff has printed yet (because it's my job).

Cartridges: It comes with everything you need to start. From what I gather, these starters are half full and will last about 700 pages, but replacements, well this is where all the printers get you. There are 4 cartridges and to replace all 4 with Canon products will cost more than the price of the printer.  I fully intend to try some of the other sources available on Amazon.

Overall: As some reviews have said, it doesn't print duplex. I guess you need to be willing to pay more for a different printer for that flipping the paper function (Canon MF726Cdw about $50 more). For me, at this price, I am perfectly content without it. Overall, for my purposes (general home, kids' projects, iPhone, copy/printing stuff), it's been a terrific buy.",34,8.126026

Furthermore, now the printer says the cartridges appear damaged and won't print at all. Of course, we can say, this is HP's fault, however I am not about to swap out printers over this- What I am instead is very, very disappointed in these cartridges. NOTICE how they say in ""Retail Packaging,"" I would suggest it says this instead of ""genuine"" because they cannot say genuine but would expect innocent consumers to think these are the same thing- they are not.

The zipper lock keeps the name badge securely within, although it does reduce the size of the card that can fit in there.
If using magnets, and you're doing more than a bunch (50+) I recommend making a template for placement of the magnet to the back of the badge.

1607,"After testing the MP530 for a few days I can say that I am very pleased with this machine. Canon did a great job with the MP530, nicely balancing the quality of and thereby the value offered by each of its components. The setup of each function is often different and therefore awkward. For example, the if you want to copy something and there is no paper in the Auto Feed tray (in the back), you have to manually switch (by pressing a button) to the Cassette. I guess it would have been nice if Canon had included sensors for the two different input bays, something my similarly priced single function HP printer has.

The print quality is, as others have mentioned before me, excellent. You can't beat the one picoliter technology that Canon offers. The fax setup with the phone line connection took a few tries to figure it out (the manual can be confusing at times), but I got it to work without having to call tech support.

Another plus (which is coincidentally also a negative), the MP530 is so quiet that you could have it operating in your bedroom without any kind of disturbance. However, if you are like me and you want to get something from the kitchen while a large picture is printing, you'd listen to hear if the machine is ready. Once I step away from the unit, ambient noise simply drowns out the noise from the printhead.

Basically, for the price of a set of tanks for most typical SOHO machines, you can pick up this unit with ""demo"" tanks that will last (as they did me) for about 2 months of heavy use, and incidentally, get the about the best printer you can get for the money.

Wait; you say, it's too big, and it *only* prints! How often do you can or fax, really? And doesn't a dedicated machine always perform better? Yes, it's big, we get that. But I would have made room for an HP LJ in the early days if I could have had one. Besides, once you get used to having dedicated paper trays, you will never want a rear feed unit again.

I continue to be surprised and impressed by the Canon Maxify, ordering online I did not take time to visualize its size, but judging from the price I was not expecting to get a machine of this stature, possessing so many features and evidently some truly surprising functionality.

This printer does so much more than any other I have used to date- that would be many- it would require far too much space and reader attention to adequately summarize or describe here. And it does these things so well it is difficult to believe, and at a cost so reasonable that is equally difficult to believe.

It's been over 4 months since writing this, and after finally changing 3 of the 4 ""setup"" tanks (yellow is still hanging on) I discover through the Web interface the Maxify has printed over 800 sheets. BTW, the report generated is as thorough as I have ever seen, with not only page count, but color/BW, what type of paper, single or duplex.)

I have no difficulty in forgiving a machine for not being capable of doing more than it was designed, especially a printer that shows there are so many ways to produce prints you have not even been aware of until you try the Canon. As of this writing, the ability to effortlessly turn any document into a nearly-professional, perfectly ordered and sized booklet still amazes me.

The print quality is at the level of any inkjet I have used, perhaps not at a blazing speed but steady and reliable with nothing but enthusiasm at pumping out pages continuously. Using my up-to-now primary printer, a surprisingly enduring HP Photosmart 1000, the HP spit out a draft test sheet in 14 seconds, sadly, sometimes with a manual paper feed assist. The Canon, at ""normal"" setting was about 8. Changing to ""draft"" in the Windows dialog (there isn't one in the Canon software) didn't change the speed or quality from normal, but the HP dropped to 10. Legible, but not presentable.

At the other end, the HP on ""best"" was 24 seconds, the Canon about the same, but the quality was 100% better. Higher print modes deliver better results with the attendant slowdown, as with photos- I have no problem with the output quality, but still an issue or two about printer's thoughts regarding paper auto-detection. But this is really a matter of notification rather than war, and can be disabled so you can run whatever paper you please and never be bothered by what the printer thinks. It all depends on how you ""register"" paper in a tray in the first place. And after wondering why this is necessary in a one-user environment, I discovered how to disable any additional input when adding new media.

For what is essentially  workhorse draft printer, I find the photo print quality is acceptable. I planned to use the HP Photosmart as a standard of sorts, and while it was always capable of surprisingly good output, due to lack of color ink I can't presently compare the Canon to a fresh print.

I have long desired a dedicated large format photo printer somewhere down the line, and since the choice is basically now down to Epson and Canon, I believe this machine has done a lot of campaigning for Canon already.

Right out of the box- or for that matter, even still in the box- the Canon just looks as if it means business. And business is printing, not faxing or scanning or copying. I believe that serious users, Canon and I would be in agreement to think of this machine as semi-pro, and I only say ""semi"" because the cost is so absurdly low as to disavow any commercial use. I suspect they could have increased the list price significantly, and once word got out not only would they still have sold a boatload of them, people might actually feel as if they were getting a more serious solution.

Hope the video hits some key points, this is a Borg shaped flat black cube that defies adequate lighting, especially when shooting alone and quickly. (And yeah, I know the inking is out of order.) Of course, by way of a disclaimer one might expect that as for most all tech-mech, especially lower cost items, the final word is not readily available until a long time in service.

The quick start guide is beneath basic, and really is of little help telling you nothing that is not already fairly obvious. I had noticed a few reviewers had difficulties with the ink carriage shipping block, it did seem like it would take a lot of effort to remove without causing fear of breakage. But when, against the advice of the QS, I powered it up, the print head moved just slightly and it literally fell out.

I chose my oldest method of setup to start, an aging but reliable Windows XP machine, a USB cable and the CD. It didn't really take very long, and when done it just worked. The only small issue I had was paper selection. It took me a few tries to realize, at least so far, that it sees the upper tray (#1)as the secondary source of special paper, while the bottom tray, #2, is happiest when being used by regular size and weight paper. This is the reverse of some other machines I have used, and may be as simple as changing a setting I missed, but during setup it would not recognize photo paper in the #1 tray and allowed no way to change to it while running a job. But the #1 tray would accept and feed anything you cared to throw into it.

It didn't hit me until a little later- one small feature missing is a simple way to feed a single piece of unusual media through, usually an envelope. It took removing and resizing the drawer, then re-registering it when reinserting, (which is done every time you open the paper tray anyway). With one tray dedicated to plain paper,  the can other dedicated to a specific job- envelopes, labels, postcards, or a 4X6 photo paper, this is actually no big deal for me, but it would have been nice.

In the process of learning this, I had my first jam- 50# photo paper, and saw at once the disadvantage of having a printer that is more or less committed to a life in close quarters. I was barely able locate mine in a slide-out shelf of an equipment rack in my desk, it required both leveling and shims to allow it to move freely- and even so, you can't slide a thick piece of paper along either side.

A not-very-well marked panel on the backside easily swings out of the way to get to the back of the handling mechanism and lets you pull out the jam. I would not want to be doing it very many times a day, but so far I am confident most paper mishandling errors will be caused by the user, I think this was a crinkled edge problem.

Sending a job to this printer opens up a huge amount of control and setup choices. For instance, we have the ""Paper Save"" options: instead of just a draft mode, we can tell a 2 page doc to fit on one page, they call it ""2 on 1"", which resizes the text and rotates it to fit side by side as a landscape page. Additionally, there is ""4 on 1"", which is the same as 2 on 1 but duplexed and for many, will definitely call for better glasses. But would in fact be perfectly sized for printing CD liner notes.

Downloaded a user manual and want a hard copy? Just select ""Booklet"", it auto-rotates alternating pages, shrinks them to 2 facing pages, saves 75% paper, and you have a user manual in about 5 minutes. (Helps if you have a deep-throat stapler, too though:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Swingline-Long-Reach-Stapler-with-Built-in-Ruler-and-Adjustable-Locking-Paper-Guide-Black-S7034121P/dp/B0006HUPRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Swingline Long Reach Stapler with Built-in Ruler and Adjustable Locking Paper Guide, Black (S7034121P)</a>) or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stanley-Bostitch-AntiJam-Standard-Booklet-Stapler-20-Sheet-Capacity-B440SB/dp/B0006HVU8S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stanley Bostitch AntiJam Standard Booklet Stapler, 20 Sheet Capacity (B440SB)</a>. Genius

Draft mode is still available but not a Canon feature, which is not necessarily a bad thing. at least on a few other printers I have tried would be more aptly called ""smudged and illegible"". When using it with the Canon, the output is not delivered appreciably faster.

Ah, duplexing. A minor miracle for my office, after always having one at work (wherever that might have been ) I have never personally had the luxury. While the action here is a bit too visible for comfort, be sure to have the outfeed slide extended and you will scarcely notice and probably become instantly used to it. And be careful, in keeping with what must be extreme material cost reduction, the slide is absolute no thicker than need be and would probably not be wise to leave protruding in traffic.

Even watermarks or ""Stamp/Background"" as they call it, I had never even thought I needed it, now it'll probably become indispensable.

OK, I give up, too much stuff to list. Let's say, ""just about anything you can think of. And some you might not have.""

My other Windows XP PC was relatively easy to set up, it just saw it, copied the drivers and went to work, it just gets with the program. Speed is adequate for an inkjet, I would say paper handling and quality are superior.

The Win 7 laptop was a bit more of a bother, if even that- I tried to do a quick as an install as possible just to see, and while the PC saw the Canon on the network it could not find a driver anywhere to make it work. I downloaded the first one I found at the Canon website, it looked correct but was apparently in Japanese. No problem, I had worked through the CD install already and knew what buttons to hit, but chickened out anyway, suspecting the control panels later on would likely not be in Kanji.

I tried again and pointed the Windows installer to the CD, it found what it wanted and was happy. Well, almost: it prints fine, all the features are there, but the device does not show up on the list of available printers, this deserve a re-visit.

Wireless is a method  of connecting and printing which art this point I rarely use. But I enabled the wi-fi setup, it connected to the Internet through the router and also became visible to all devices but a really old iPhone. If it is connected via Ethernet, this method of connectivity is disabled as are the auto power-on and off.

 I have not fully explored all of the Internet useability which is possible here, there are just too many choices to test in order derive a well informed opinion, but I can tell you that you will be able to monitor the ink levels from anywhere. The iPad recognized the printer by native wi-fi, and eventually decided to print- it was quite slow. I am thinking (hoping) AirPrint will speed things up somewhat, but it is a separate app from Canon and I have so far not been allowed to try it.

OK, it's big. Almost every review anywhere I have read feels obliged to point that out, which shows how far tech has come- or slid, depending on your attitude about bigger = better. Also, this suggests that not everyone who reacted in this manner (including myself) had seen the printer in person before making a selection.

Another oft-mentioned perceived shortcoming and as is bemoaned in a large percentage of reviews is that this is only a printer. To me it is a welcome thing, I would much rather have a dedicated device for each purpose- which is essentially only two anyway, what is a fax or a copy but a scan?

I was prepared to laugh at this thing, but now I applaud it and Canon for breaking away from the all-in-one ""fad"", and for giving us an affordable device that does everything a printer should be expected to deliver. Efficiently, completely, and creatively. I could wind down by saying this is the first machine I have used that is affordable yet handles advanced printing functions including duplex printing effortlessly. But there is so much more this printer seems capable of than I have time and space to list, if you're in the shopping and want far more than you would expect for your dollars, I suggest you pick one up and see for yourself.

Consumables: While I am still collating data marred by sloppy record keeping, the magenta tank I replaced in April '15 just went below critical. It halted the print job, though once I cleared it, it was able to resume but with a warning each time. I guess they mean it, since the level went from low to empty in about 3 jobs. And fortunately I read the warning that alerted me to to the fact that you can't simply remove the tank and shake it for a few more peaceful days, once a used one is out it will only accept a new cartridge.

I have not been printing especially color-heavy, but not shoeing much restraint either, and have run more photos than usual. But while 4 months for the ""Regular"" sized tank is just within what I'd call acceptable, I will henceforth purchase only the XL's- which, unlike the regular size, are not available to me locally. I continue to print while shopping, but definitely keeping it to grayscale.

August 2017: after almost 3 years of medium to heavy use, the Canon finally packed it in. Had a rear paper jam, I gleared it and it did it again, this time noisier and making bad sounds. When I opened the rear door it didn't feel right, so I had a look and a small plastic guide had popped out; since the thing is nothing but small white plastic guides I figured it was hopeless, and pondered a replacement. Repair is the first think I think of, but the cost was a close second, knowing I could probably replace it with a superior machine for a good deal less than paying someone to fix it. And good luck with that, not only would it be a tedious and expensive process to try it, I myself would find it amusomg that anyone would bother.

But as it hapened, I found the place for the comb and snapped it in. Piece of cake. It printed a Windows test page perfectly and I thought I had it made.

Next a 20 page job and it jammed immediately, and clearing did nothing. Back to plan ""B"". I did not like the idea of having to shop for a replacement, last time I say a Staples ad there were over 20 printers on sale.

So much to my surprise, when I looked at the Canon I saw the price had fallen to about half from when I originally wrote this review. Since I had just bought replacement cartridges, it was sort of being forced into it, but you could just say that it made the decision easier. I also have read you cannot replace the tanks with partially used ones, which, as I just changed two of the color ones a few months ago, really sucks.

Once again I realized the main purpose of these machines is not to print documents, but to burn ink. Seriously, buying another set of tanks was three times the cost of the printer. And it kills me every time I see someone running a perfectly functional Okidata 320 or HP LJ3

But since ink usage was relatively low, it is ordered. I am interested but yet to be impressed by externally refillable tank models. If my replacement gives as long a life as the deceased, I am OK.

But will start shopping anew, just in case.",4,14.611499

While the ink is good, as are the pens, the ink in the barrel does not last too long. After a month of note taking, or less, really. Count about 4 lectures and 4 weeks worth of reading material notes, and the blue, green, and purple were skipping and almost out of ink. I would alternate colors for my notes and so that I wouldn't run a pen out so quickly.

1620,"If you're looking for a DECT VOIP phone system, there are a number of choices out there, and they're tough to decide between based on the ads alone. We'd been using Snom M3s, and while they worked, they felt like cheap, flimsy toys. Based on positive experiences with Panasonic telephone products in the past, we purchased a base station plus two additional handset, and have been very happy with the result. The units are solid, fit your hand well, and the audio is excellent. Though the screen is monochrome (unlike the color screen on the Snoms), its bigger, clearer, and visible over a wider viewing angle, making for a more positive experience. Configuration went quickly and smoothly.

All in all, the experience was positive enough that we'll probably be adding a few more handsets to the system pretty soon.",3,6.9415073
1621,"This printer is amazing for a home office or a business. I'm surprised at how  low the price of this printer is: it's worth much more than $200. It copies EXTREMELY fast, prints fast, and its copying options (reduce, enlarge) are up to par with copiers that cost considerably more. My favorite feature is by far the automatic document feeder. It is AMAZING and much better than any I've used before--even on the extremely large--and expensive--Xerox copiers. The printer goes into sleep mode when it's not being used; you can't even tell it's on when it's in sleep mode, which is great. It saves energy, too. Even if you don't use a printer much at your home/office, you should buy this product.

The Great Things are that:

 -The print quality is great, strong print

 -Copies virtually anything efficiently

 -AMAZING automatic document feeder

 -Extremely fast printer

 -Great sleep function to save energy

 -Great toner save function to save toner

Some people might complain though:

 -It does make some noise when processing print jobs/copying, but it doesn't bother me at all

 -Electricity. Sometimes when I print/copy documents the light starts to flicker a little.

Overall, the best printer I've ever purchased.",10,9.405738
1622,"I bought this set for my parents and it works great. I love that the keypad number keys are significantly larger than most cordless keypads. Even the fattest fingers are able to accurately and securely press on a key and not worry about the keys next to them. The LCD displays are pretty large too so it makes the incoming caller ID that much easier to read. Another thing I liked about the system is that all the handsets are ""interchangeable"" with the bases. For example, if I answer the phone in the living room and have to pass the phone to someone in the kitchen, I can just place the handset into the kitchen base (if it need a charge). With the old Panasonic cordless system you had to return a specific handset to a specific base station or it wouldn't ""connect"" with the system.

Also, the base station (the biggest unit in the picture) has big buttons and clear message indicators. There's a big button that has the ""Play"" symbol making it easy to identify which button to press to play a message. The ""Erase"" button is just as easy and big to locate. If you wait maybe 5 seconds after the phone rings, the caller ID will get displayed on the LCD screen and the handset will actually speak out-loud the number that is calling. It's really good for older people who might not be able to get to the unit in time after the 2nd ring.

There's extra functions like linking your cell phone and stuff to the system but I didn't activate / use that. Overall, it's a great, simple system that words well. It's great for older people but younger people as well. Oh and the volume is loud enough so that my Dad (who's a little hard of hearing) is OK with it. Usually he struggles getting the volume high enough with cordless phones.",2,6.5696654
1623,"I read the reviews but seeing the overwhelming amount of 5 star reviews, I took a chance and purchased this. I should have known better, this is NOT photo paper.

1625,"This has been so much fun! Whenever I get anything digital, I always worry I won't be able to figure it out, but this is really easy to use. You can use it as-is or put in your own memory card, which is what I like to do. Then you turn it on, you choose what kind of film it is (slide, negative, 35mm, etc.), then you decide if you want to save it. It's that easy. There are other otpions and I need to read the instructions more, but I've been perfectly happy with what I've been doing so far. It also will flip the image over (if you put the negative or slide in upside down or backwards). It's really handy and very simple to get the hang of it.

Then after I copied several pictures, I took the memory card out and put it in the little device I have to transfer it into my computer and played with the photos in Picasa (which you can google and download for free - for anyone who doesn't have Photoshop or anything like that), and I really had fun cropping and brightening old photos.

In the past when I used to always use a 35mm camera, as it got older it did not always take the best pictures. And sometimes when I would get a roll of film developed I would notice a picture in the negatives that they didn't print for me. I asked them once why that happens and they said it was because maybe the picture was too dark, or perhaphs over-exposed and too bright and it wouldn't come out good. But now with this device I can go and see what those ""lost"" photos are like. I have to say, I have been finding quite a few that to me definitely are worth having. Just because someone at the photo booth didn't think it was worth it doesn't mean it isn't a picture I would want. I put 2 examples above in the images near the product image if you want to see what I mean.

One picture was at the end of the roll and you can see where the film was ending and getting light exposure or whatever when it was time to take the film out of the camera. But these days with digital technology it was so easy for me to crop off the top of the picture and then just tweak the light a little to make it a little better quality. It's not the best photo as far as quality goes, but this brings back a memory of this day that I had forgotten, and I just love that.

The other picture they never developed for me is one that I am so happy to have. I had never seen this before and if I didn't have this Wolverine Converter, I would never have known this was on my negatives. Again, it seems a bit over-exposed, but I am so happy to have this. Our cat recently passed away, at 17 years old, and seeing this picture of him when he and my daughter were both younger just makes me smile. And to think, I would have missed this totally just because the person who developed my film thought it was not worth developing.

I eventually stopped using my old 35 mm camera and now I have a digital one. But all the boxes of old pics I have, I can now take the negatives and check them out to see if there are any surprise photos like these or sometimes you give pictures away even though you don't have doubles, and then you just forget about it. So this is a fun and very handy item to have. So often I would want to get copies of pictures made, but just never bother. Now I can do it whenever I want.

The only down side of this converter to me was that the cord is so short. I had to get an extension cord to use it. But I am enjoying using it so much that the cord is not too much of an issue. So I have to give this five stars because I love photos and memories and this really has been great. Now to get some old slides from my mother-in-law to get some pics of my husband when he was little. It's like all these memories that would otherwise just be lost are now right at our fingertips. Things like that just really make me so excited and happy. If you are like that too, then you will really be happy with this converter.

P.S. I have tried uploading the cropped and fixed versions of my 2 photos a few times, but for some reason, they are just not showing up. But the original photos stright from the negatives are there.",14,11.429266

1635,"ASSEMBLY

This little desk came to me in a lightweight flat box.  I couldn't tell there was a desk inside.  Assembly was quick and easy with the exception of the screws on the wheelie feet.  They need to go through plastic, which has indentations for the screws but no actual holes.  That took a bit of strength, but the rest of assembly went smoothly and only took a few minutes.

ADJUSTABILITY

The knob and ring for loosening and tightening the desktop tilt and height are stiffer than I'd like.  That's something I only have to deal with occasionally.  After I get everything the way I like it, I just leave it.

The height is good for people in most chairs.  Don't expect to use it on a barstool.  It doesn't go up that high.  Use it while on a couch or office chair.

WHEELS

The wheels are small and low to the ground.  My first impression was I'd like them to be bigger so they'd roll well.  After using it, I see the utility of low-lying wheels.  They're low enough to slide under the couch so I can bring the desktop right up to me.

Rolling the desk around on carpet hasn't been a problem.  If I need to take it any big distance, I just pick it up and carry it.  It's so lightweight.

Two of the wheels have locks, but I don't use them.

LIGHT

The light works on 3 AA batteries.  It hides underneath the desktop in a slot until needed.  The neck is adjustable, but I wish it was longer.  My left hand blocks the light when I'm working on the desk.

OTHER FEATURES

The fan and USB ports work off the power from the laptop.  We get four USB ports.

The fan turns on automatically when connected.  It's perfectly placed for a larger laptop.  My husband's 17 inch laptop fills up most of the desk.  The area where it gets hottest is on the left, which sits right over the fan.

My netbook is small and sits on the left side of the desk so that it also sits over the fan.  I don't need a fan for the netbook, though.  It doesn't get very hot.

I was hoping the USB ports could be used as a hub, but they are only to power devices.  I tried connecting a flash drive and an SD card in a reader and the computer couldn't see them.  I connected a USB powered fan, and that worked.

I'd prefer the ports be located on the right side instead of the left, because my netbook sits on the left over the fan, so there's more room on the right to sit my devices.

Lastly, there's a little drawer.  I like the drawer.  It comes in handy for storing cords, styli, and microfiber cloths.

OVERALL IMPRESSION

This is a nice little desk.  It's good for us folks who like working on their netbooks while watching TV in the family room.  I wouldn't recommend it as the only desktop.  It's too small for serious work, but it's portable and small enough that it doesn't take up much room.

1636,"There are pros and cons to these markers, depending on what you like.

PROS:
The white is VERY white, nice and opaque.
Inflow seems pretty steady with proper treatment (shaking nib-side up with the cap on and priming the tip before each use)

CONS (matter of taste):
The point is not as fine as something like the RayMay chalk marker (and I prefer a fine point)
The density of the ink means extra passes to get it all off when removing with water

I haven't experienced any issues with staining and would recommend these, especially if you're after a very opaque white ink and you don't mind a few extra wipes to get it off your surface. I'm using these on a 1960's era chalkboard that was recovered from a school, not on a modern chalkboard-painted surface, so YMMV depending on the porosity of the surface you're using, but the markers are VERY clearly marked with regard to how to use and how to test a surface before going to town.

As far as the seller goes, although I rate the product at 4 stars, CraftyCroc is definitely a five-star seller.

CraftyCroc is a small, family-run business selling through Amazon. Their customer service is very attentive - they emailed me once to acknowledge they'd received my order through Amazon, again when it shipped (same day), again to check whether the order had been delivered, and a fourth time to check whether I'd received the order (with the gift of an e-book including usage tips, inspirational ideas for use, lots of valuable information on caring for your markers,and some great offers). That fourth email promised a fifth check-in email in about a week to make sure everything is going well and I'm happy with the purchase.

1645,"These pens are GREAT! They have an astonishing assortment of colors, are comfortable to hold, have vivid ink, and are 100% ERASEABLE!

The Shell:  5 stars unless you NEED a clip
These pens are completely made of plastic, including the cap and grip, but I don't have any issues with that, because they don't look terrible (they look pretty good), it makes it easy to tell which color is which, and holding them is still supremely easy on you hands. Unless you write a 10 page essay by hand with these, you won't experience fatigue or cramping. One minor issue some people will have is the fact that they are lacking a proper clip, instead sporting a small ""bump"" on the cap.

The Ink:  5 stars
All of the ink colors are vivid, lay down nicely, and are, with the exception of yellow, clearly visible and dark enough to read on white paper. And, as advertised, they erase cleanly, and you can't tell whether an area has been erased, even if you have written over it. When you erase, it is slightly more difficult than erasing a pencil, as you have to create enough friction to erase the ink. As you probably know, the ink is temperature sensitive, so you shouldn't use them in places that will experience a lot of heat. No worries though: if you pop them in the freezer, you'll get it all back (including the stuff you erased before though :( ). The ink is pretty quick drying, and I have had 0 problems with smearing or bleeding. 0 PROBLEMS!!!

The Separate Erase: : (
This eraser was tiny, much smaller than it looks in the picture! I looked at the other ones on Amazon, and the dimensions were bigger. It works well, but is on the small side. But hey, it's only 2 cents to get it vs. the non included set.
There are a couple tiny issues that might deter you if they really need those feature, but all in all, if you are looking for an eraseable pen (or even if you're not), you should pick up this pen next chance you got.

Pros:
- Great grip
- Seems sturdy
- Erases completely
- Colorful ink
- Quick drying ink

Cons:
- No clip
- Small eraser attached",10,13.140373

I dread having to replace them.  Maybe that's why I don't do much printing with it.

Quality wise, it's a nice printer for the cost but if you have a lot to print, look for something else.  The HP 60 cartridges are decently priced but for the cost of the special XL cartridges, I could buy another cheap printer.  Not something I will do again.",34,6.669849

1670,"For the longest time I used whatever kind of CD/DVD marker I could find in whatever store -- Staples, Best Buy, OfficeMax -- that I happened to be in at the time.  More often than not I found Maxell markers.  But I found their rather broad points not terribly effective.  The first time that I used these Sharpie markers, I knew that I'd found the only brand that I would use in the future.

Frankly, although the marker has two tips, the broader one is similar to the Maxell markers that I already didn't much care for.  But the other end, the finer tip, is exquisite, perfect for labeling discs.  Honestly, I don't even know why markers for CD/DVDs is made with the broader tips.

Sharpie makes these markers in a variety of tips, but I recommend basic black.  I take a pretty utilitarian approach to all this.  I want it to work.  And for most purposes the black works best.  And for all purposes, the narrower tip works best.  If Sharpie ever brings this same marker out with only the narrow tip, I'll switch to that.",12,5.578022

1672,"I have 3 SLR cameras (canon film, canon t2i, sony alpha) and tend to print most of my prints at home after I got the Canon Pixma Pro Mark II in 2011 - which is a predecessor of this printer.  After I obtained the Pixma Pro-1, i have never looked at ordering prints, choosing to print all my prints on my Pro-1.

The advantages of printing pro quality pictures at your home is not really that of cost - infact it might be more expensive to print at home, but the advantage is the ability to control the image settings and print it exactly as you wish.  Not to mention all the fun you can have by printing your own photo books, Calendars with your kids as well as making business prints for a presentation.

The fun is endless, as long as you like photography, trust me, a printer like this is necessary.

Print Quality
=============
If you see an image shot on you SLR on your laptop, LCD/LED screen - they all look different depending on which display you see it, but when you print it on a Pro-1 - it is truly a real representation of the real precise colors of nature stored in depth of each of the pixel on the image.  The quality of the images even on a 11x14 print is just not comparable to any print.

Compared to the Pixma Pro-1 and Pixma Pro Mark II 9000 - both are very good, but Pixma Pro-1 clearly shows a greater depth and diversity of colors in detailed nature shots.

Cartridge
=========
Now, coming to the Pro series printers from canon - this is not your level 1/level 2 printers that contain B/W & color or 3 different color cartridges.
  Pixma Pro 1 comes with 12 Individual cartridges
  Pixma Pro Mark II 9000 contains 8 individual cartridges

The number of cartridges will help in producing the most precise color on your prints.  In each print dialog, it displays the quantity of the ink remaining in each cartridge, the cost is pretty expensive about 350 for 12 pack, 120 for 6 pack and 35 for individual cartridge.

Print size
===========
Both Pixma Pro-1 and Pixma Pro 9000 Mark II support similar sizes upto 13"" x 19""

Ink precision
==============
The ink delivery from the ink cartridges comes in as tiny droplets sprayed in precision, the smaller the size of the drop, the more precise is the print.

  Pixma Pro 1 is 4 picoliters and Pixma Pro Mark II 9000 is 2 picoliters.

  Pixma Pro Mark II 9000 is a clear winner on this, but the larger droplet size will allow the Pro-1 to print faster.

In summary :
If you are a hobbyist like me - a Canon Pixma Pro Mark II 9000 is a decent printer to play with - this is good to print all your calendars, posters for your small business ...

If you are a professional either sells photographs as a profession or someone who shoots nature photography as a hobby, you should go for a Canon Pro-1.  The quality and dept of colors will make a huge difference and impact on your customers perception.",16,14.678658

It was difficult finding a fire safe security chest on Amazon that was actually long enough to hold a full sheet of 8x11 without needing to fold it over. I ended up buying this one because of the reviews.

Unfortunately it arrived in a different color, tan with a few minor chipped paint around the edges. Which I prefer a livelier green color but am reluctant to return it all over again, so I will keep it. It's primary purpose is to hold tax returns so I wanted this to be sturdy and resistant. I ended up buying extra large Ziplock freezer bag and placing the files/papers/receipts inside of them for added water protection.

For example, missed calls are flagged by a broken arrow at the top of the display instead of the words MISSED CALL. The speakerphone is loud enough to be able to hear comfortably.

After refilling more than once sometimes the carts begin to leak the toner. It's fast enough for a small office. The print quality is very good and it is used it to print wills, court documents, and our business cards: we use only high quality papers (at least $12 a ream) by the way.

I like the fact that there are no plastic flaps or doors that must be left open.

I used general principles from Jim Treleases's Read Aloud Handbook (read aloud often and discuss everything) to improve my son's general reading comprehension, but I felt that he needed specific instruction on the types of questions he might encounter on standardized tests.

While I generally love Evan-Moor products, this book is better than their ""Read and Understand"" series and far superior to the Spectrum workbooks I've picked up.

This book presents reading comprehension as a game - my son becomes a ""Reading Detective"", looking for the specific clues in the readings that will provide the answer to higher level questions. Kids are required to specify the sentences that provide the clues in addition to providing the answer. I like how this gets my son engaged in meta-cognition, as he tries to figure out how he knows what he knows.

Specifically, the book provides instruction and practice in drawing conclusions & making inferences; defining vocabulary using context; identifying story parts; identifying the main idea and supporting details; identifying the theme; identifying cause and effect; and making predictions.

1696,"After 3 months of use, I am still very pleased with this Panasonic phone.  The sound quality on the speaker phone and handset is good/normal, but I am also pleased with the great sound quality when using a head set (which was my primary purpose).  I used an older ""no name"" mono-ear telephony headset I had lying around and it works fine.

It is important to note that this phone uses batteries to power the speakerphone and headset volume, and not AC from a wall socket.  Consequently, if you do not install the batteries, you will get poor/nil speakerphone and headset performance.  Nearly all of the few lower rated reviews appear to be caused by either not reading the instructions fully or improper use.

I have had great performance since day one and expect my battery life to be equally good. (personally I use rechargeable batteries in all my products anyway, so this is not a concern).  After only 90 days use, I am still on the original set of batteries. Heavy speakerphone use would probably drain the batteries faster, but that is expected.  Incidentally, I like knowing that my phone is not dependent on the power grid and will work even when the power goes out.  This phone will do that, even without batteries (but not via speakerphone).

The number memory function works well, with room for 24 saved numbers and the mute button and volume controls are very useful and work as designed. I also enjoy the large size of the number buttons/lettering. I have recently moved it from my desk top to a wall mount and am even more pleased with the phone (wall mount adapter is included).

Overall great product that I would buy again and highly recommend to anyone - especially if they are looking for a headset phone.

** UPDATE Feb 2011-  After 14 months, I am still happy with this phone - so much so that I bought another one for a different room for my wife.  Big buttons, great headphone, handset and speaker phone clarity.  I use the speaker phone a couple of times a week and still have not needed to replace the batteries.  Overall Excellent phone.  On one phone I use the Panasonic KX-TCA60 Hands-Free Headset and on the other I use the Plantronics M214C Headset, both work wonderfully with this phone and are inexpensive as well as comfortable.

Nicely adjustable with lots of variations for movement.
There are little clips that come with the USB cable and it took me a minute to figure those out.  Near as I can tell, they go on the front to keep the laptop from sliding down if it is in a more vertical position.
I have a 15"" laptop and it sits nicely.  This might be a snug fit for a larger one, like a 17"" one.  The laptop area has a dimpled surface (little dots all over, raised) that are supposed to help keep it in place I would assume.  The mouse pad area would do much better if it had that same surface.
I didn't think much of the cooling feature but I actually really like it.  Not so much for the safety of the laptop because that's never been an issue, but when I'm sitting and have this across my lap, it keeps my legs cooler.

I'm really glad I did because the pens work well and the colors selection is wonderful for the price point. These colors are vivid are the selection is so extensive that she'll be able to use these pens for a variety of different projects here at home and in school!

The set include a total of 48 pens that come in 4 trays that hold 12 each. Each set includes an assortment of colors that include 6 standard, 6 neon, 6 swirl (mixed colors), 12 glitter, 10 metallic, and 8 milky (these are actually pastels), and the tips is about the same as a ballpoint pen so it's easy to draw (or write) smoothly.  The set we received had one non-working pen, but the rest all worked well with the gel ink flowed smoothly without skipping. There were two blacks in our set, but otherwise we didn't notice any other repeated colors although some seemed similar; for example, you may notice a blue metallic or glitter that looks almost identical to a blue neon, but not two similar in the same medium that we could see. So overall the color selection was quite extensive!

These gel pens are fun and useful for drawing, making greeting cards, party invitations, or just about any creative project you can imagine.  The colors went on the paper nicely without bleeding around the line edges or through the paper, and we're delighted with them.  It's really handy to have the trays to return the pens to when finished using them as well.  I'm including a photo of the drawing my granddaughter made so you could see some of the colors in use.

1708,"I wish I could give this 5 stars but I cannot.

First, the details.
The cutter is solid and works as advertised and while I have not had the opportunity to subject it to the ""Test of Time"", it certainly appears to be capable and worthy of the title Durable.
This model is defined as a 12 inch paper cutter, HOWEVER, it should be noted that the cutting table is NOT 12 inches wide horizontally. It IS 13 3/8 inches wide vertically from guide to guide.
Horizontally it is 11 inches wide total.
You can cut 12x12 inch paper, however you cannot use the moveable guide on paper wider than 9 1/2 inches.
The moveable guide with red button lock is 1 3/8 inches wide and can only be employed at a position that is at the end of the horizontal guide and no further.
I cut 12x12 paper in my current projects and must remove the moveable cutting guide with red button lock completely.
Removal and replacement of the moveable guide is extremely quick and easy without any tools. (it is designed to be removed)
IF.... you require the cutting of paper in excess of 9 1/2 inches WITH use of the moveable guide, this is Not the model you should purchase.
Without use of the moveable guide it will cut 12x12 and 13x19 paper.

The plastic shield on the right appears to be a finger saver or safety device (and it is) but it is much more than that.
The shield is a finger operated spring loaded paper clamp you simply press down upon when cutting.
This is a Very Important and useful feature.
When a paper cutter begins its cut, it pulls the paper towards the cutting edges and ""can"" cause the paper to slip.
This shield / clamp, stops this from happening.
You line up your cut and press down on the shield / clamp and the paper stays put without trimming your fingernails or fingers.
Sadly this also creates an unfortunate side-effect that is only a tiny annoyance.
You must look down over the shield (from right to left) to line up ""where"" the cut is to be made. (a Very Minor inconvenience)
The cutter blade is sturdy and is Not spring loaded.
The cutter blade is held in place or in the up position by friction alone.
This WILL require periodic tightening of the Nut / Bolt pivot as described in the owner's manual. (good news is.... there is no spring to eventually break)

So WHY did I not give this cutter 5 stars????
I cannot give this cutter 5 stars because the guides are slightly Out of Square with the cutter blade.
This ""slightly"" out of square is roughly 1/64 of an inch.
This out of square IS the product of the guides being mounted by rivets.
Thing is.... the one YOU buy may be perfectly In Square and stands a 90% chance of being perfectly square.
This tiny out of square is the production tolerance created by the riveting of the guides instead of machining the guides.

You will not experience any truly substantial out of square problems but using this cutter to place objects into space with precise tolerances is out of the question.

I do NOT use this cutter to cut multiple sheets at once.
This entire review is based upon single sheet use ONLY.

Bottom line....
It is well built and and does a very good job for all but the most precise demands.",9,14.4568615

1711,"I needed a reliable dorm room-sized all in one printer, and the Epson XP-430 was the perfect fit. Its not without flaws, but its definitely a reliable printer.

SIZE AND FORM FACTOR: The Epson XP-430 feels as portable and heavy as a small stack of textbooks.

PERFORMANCE: The printer takes some time to warm up, but it prints reliably and relatively quickly once the printing starts. The setup process was smooth with the CD provided, and after following all the network configuration prompts on the printer and computer screen, air printing from mobile devices connected to the network is a breeze.

PRINT QUALITY: The print quality is good, both for black and white pages as well as photo prints.
A big downside to this printer is that it CANNOT automatically duplex print/print double sided. It took a while to figure out how to manually flip the paper around, but you have to follow the on-screen prompts and look at the printer screen for a small infographic on how to manually double-side your prints.
This printer does have an SD card slot, and can print photos at various paper sizes without the need of a computer. It can also print at virtually any paper size under Letter-sized pages, with a plastic paper guide and on-screen page size adjuster.

SCAN QUALITY: The scan quality is great, and true to color, much better than the scan quality of older HP models Ive used. The printer can scan at 200dpi, 300dpi, and 600dpi. For quick copies, 200dpi scanning for a full page takes about 30 seconds, but 600dpi scanning takes twice as long, up to a minute per page. You can save scans as a JPEG or PDF right from the printer onto an SD card. This printer cant fax, though, although theres less need for fax compatibility when its so easy to email a PDF or JPEG attachment.

BUILD QUALITY: This is where the printer lost a star for my review. The plastic printer body feels cheap, but theyve got to cut costs somewhere, and they cut it in the build quality. The plastic isn't flimsy, but it does feel like it requires gentle, careful handling.
I was trying to print a stack of papers and while opening the top-loading paper feeder, the dust cover bent out of its hinge! I had to carefully bend the dust cover back into its little hinge before I could start the printing job.
The scanner lid also requires similar TLC. Its very lightweight, and even when I open it to scan papers, it feels like it will flop open in the slightest breeze. I tape it down when transporting it, to prevent the lid from flopping around accidentally since its so light.

NOISE: The XP-430 is already quiet enough (you won't hear it if you close the door or walk into an adjacent room) but it has a quiet mode function, which reduced the abrupt ka-chunk noise of the paper feeder as its about to print a page.

INK LONGEVITY: The starter ink that comes with the printer is fairly long-lasting. I used it to print 10 sheets of 8.5 x 11 photos, plus at least 15 black and white pages, and all the inks are still around  full. Ink refills are also inexpensive on Amazon, and at the rate they have lasted so far, printing with this printer will definitely cost less per page than what theyll charge at most campus libraries.

VERDICT: This printers build quality is not so great and it cant print double-sided, but its quiet, has a great scanner, and its compact and portable. Overall, its a great budget all-in-one printer thats perfect for dorm rooms. I hope this review was helpful to you!",17,13.689493

1716,"I bought this as an upgrade to my smaller shredder and I couldn't be happier. The cost is well justified by the extremely small microcut feature and the fact that this can handle large volumes of paper. It can shred a whole folder, folder and all, easily. The tray is simple to remove for cleaning, though it does tend to knock some paper around which is a disadvantage over the sort that sit entirely on top of the bin, but it's a small thing to clean up any fallen shreds.

This makes getting paper shredded up much more fast and efficient. If you have any reason to need to shred a lot of paper or even cardboard boxes, this will make things easier.

UPDATE:

I emailed the manufacturer and hopefully this is something that can be fixed easily but after working beautifully for several days (days though) I went to shred a group of documents and this shredder simply would not turn on. I tried plugging it into different sockets. I checked the bin, the feed, turned it off and on again, but nothing seems to make the power come back on. I hope this can be resolved.

UPDATE AGAIN: They were very nice but I could not get it to work again. Then randomly I was in the garage and one of my power tools would not work. It turned out there was a problem with an outlet in the garage and it was causing problems with the outlets inside in several rooms, hence when I plugged it into other outlets it still didn't work. This was odd because other items did, but the issue seems to have been on my side. The shredder is working again. If I hadn't already added a star I'd add one for good customer service.",2,8.277023

1719,"Can I add a 6th star?  That's how much I love this printer.  FINALLY a 'real' printer that works, doesn't make a freaking mess, and actually seems like it will last a long time.  Why did I wait so long to 'upgrade' to this?  I don't think I can ever go back to an inkjet printer.  This thing is amazing. The print quality blows me away.  The speed is awesome.  And it prints both sides of a page without me having to touch or do anything. Nice.

I have it hard wired into my desktop CPU (a printer USB cord is included!)  Then I have an ethernet cable plugged in from the printer to my router and I have all my laptops set to print from anywhere in the house via wi-fi. Perfect. My 'old' ink jet required that I go ""wake"" the printer up before my laptop could wirelessly print to it. That was a nuisance. Not the case with this printer. I can be in the kitchen and tell it to print and it 'wakes' up the printer, prints what I want, then the printer goes back to sleep. Isn't this how it SHOULD be?

Then there is the scanner. You can put pages into the top of the printer and tell the printer to scan them as JPEG or PDF and it will just suck them in, scan them, and spit them out and when it is done, you can save the output to wherever you would like. Heaven. Easy. Got something you don't think would 'feed' right? Just lift the lid, put the item on the scanner directly and do it that way. I don't think it would work great with a thick book (or anything very thick) as the lid sits flat when it is down, but I suppose you could just leave the lid up and scan while closing your eyes or turning your head away as the bright light goes by?

The paper tray holds 150 sheets which is a step up from my last printer, so that's a plus. It'd be nice if it could hold more, but that is a minor quibble. This printer just screams 'quality' from the way the parts fit and operate to the way it prints.  It draws paper up from the feed tray without trouble AND I can feed a single sheet into the front of the printer if I just want to print one page that way.  Maybe you have a piece of letterhead you want to use.  You don't have to pull out the feed tray and put it in there. You just stick it into the slot on the front, the printer pulls it in, and whatever you print will go on THAT page. Very handy. It will even work on envelopes (from what I've read) so I'll have to figure that out soon.

Printing a color picture. Seems everything I read says ""Laser Jets just can't compete with inkjets in this area.""  Well, I'm no expert but I can honestly say that this LASER JET printer from HP prints a heck of a lot better picture than my last three inkjets! Your results may vary, but if you are 'worried' about picture quality, don't be. It'll print a really nice picture!

I would buy this printer again in a heartbeat.  For my 'small business' work, it is perfect.  As a home office printer, it is perfect.  If you just need a nice home printer and you are tired of the mess of inkjets and the hassles of small paper trays and 'finicky' functioning with the $150 inkjets out there, just bite the bullet and pull the trigger on this thing.  You will be so happy you did. I am.",4,6.9041243
1720,"In todays world, AA batteries and light bulbs are becoming obsolete. Companies like OxyLed are making products like the OxyLED Q6 Portable Multi-Functional Led Lamp as an all-in-one device without the need of replacement batteries or light bulbs.

 Package Contents:
 1 x LED Portable Lamp
 1x Mini USB Cable
 2 x Lanyards
 1 x User Manual

I don't usually comment on packaging, but I will for this device. It comes in a cylinder tube, similar to the ones that are used when transferring fragile documents or maps. I may be the only one, but I really like the packaging. I could also stick this lamp into it, while it is on, to create the effect of a conventional flash light.

 Accessories:
The lamp comes with a couple accessories, including the Mini USB Cable and the two Lanyards. I really like that the interface of the lamp uses a mini USB interface, a very common cable that can be bought at most electronic stores, but wish it used micro USB, an even more common cable that most mobile devices use today. The cable is white and approximately 22 inches long. It looks like any generic cord that you would buy from an electronics store, so I cant comment that it looks durable not. The fact that OxyLED includes two 7 inch lancets seems unnecessary, other than the cool effect, as one will definitely suffice.

 Specifications
Power: About 2W
Charge port: Mini USB
Input: 5V/1000mA
Color temperature: 5500K
Luminous flux: 200Lum
Battery: Li-on battery 1800mA
Life: >36000 hours (500 times charge)
Work temperature: 0-40C

 Hardware:
The flashlight really reminds me of a baton that you would see at a race, due to its cylinder shape. Its size and weight is 10.1 x 1.6 x 1.6 inches and 8 ounces. At the top and bottom have 0.5 x 1.6 x 1.6 inch cylinder caps that are colored one of five (5) choices: blue, green, pink, white, or yellow. I really like that there are different choices of color. On the top cap is the OxyLed name and logo, and the bottom has a mini USB charging port and a button to activate the flash light.

The button activates the following modes:
 1st Press = 2% Full Brightness
 2nd Press = 50% Full Brightness
 3rd Press = 75% Full Brightness
 4th Press = 100% Full Brightness
 5th Press = 50% Full brightness, Flash on and off every 1 second
 6th Press = Off
 In any mode, a long press (2-3 seconds) can turn the flash light off.

Underneath the button, inside the colored cap, is a red LED light that will notify the following statuses:

LED Statuses:
 During Charge: The LED flashes regularly.
 Fully Charged: LED remains ON
 Low Power: Fast flash 3 times every cycle

The LED light doesnt have a clear cap, or any clear indicator unless the room is very dim. During my tests it took 2 hours to charge the device with my 2.1A charger, but it is possible that the time to charge was less, because of the lack of a clear indicator.

Under the blue cylinder caps are circle rings with the attachment for the two lancets. It looks like OxyLed went far to create this symmetrical design. At the center is the semi clear, white plastic with the LED light and the opposite side is a metallic design. I assume it wasn't clear on both sides for the battery of the LED light.

 Setup
The only setups for this device are when attaching the lancets to the holes on the lamp, and to plug the Mini USB cord into a computer or USB charger.

 Testing
I started by testing the luminosity of the LED lights. At its highest setting, I am blinded by the light, so don't attempt to stare into it. I am able to see approximately 10 feet in front of me in the dark, which is by far the best range from an LED light that I currently own.

I then tested the time that the highest setting would last. The results were as follows:
3:15PM - Start
6:17PM  Shut off

During my tests, the lamp did get warm. So be cautious when keeping this on for long periods of time. At the highest brightness setting, I was able to keep this on for 3 hours straight, which is within the 3-72 hour time per discharge.

 Final Thoughts
I overall like this LED flash light a lot. It is a bright light that can be seen within a good distance, without the need of batteries of light bulbs, which is why I give this product a 5 star rating. I would recommend it to anyone who needs a light, as it is budget friendly, but feels like it should cost double the cost.

Pros:
+ Has multiple brightness settings, including an emergency mode. The brightness at the highest setting can see be visible up to 10 feet in the dark (during my tests).
+ In my tests, I was able to keep the lamp at its highest setting for 3 hours straight.
+ Uses mini USB, a very common USB cable (Although I wish it used micro USB, an even more common USB cable)
+ Includes two lanyards, which can wrap onto your arm or backpack.

Cons:
- LED indicator is masked by the colored capped. Can only be really viewed in dim lighted areas.

1721,"I replaced an Ion ""scanner"" with this one. Not really scanners, but cameras making copies. It does many things my Ion wasn't designed for. Adjust image size, EV control, seems to produce less contrasty slide copies. But, it isn't as easy to use. Accessing. The menu takes to long and is clunky. Worst is the single image slide carrier. No multi-slide carrier, no stack adaptor, the single slide mag is very hard to get open. I don't like having to slide negative film through a carrier. Ion has more friendly, faster to use carriers. Both are made in China, appear VERY similar in design. The Ion carriers seem to fit the Jumbl unit. Copies are not consistent! I've had to make two or more shots to get a good one. It seems best to use a GOOD image processor like Adobe Photoshop or maybe Elements. Highly sophisticated corrections are needed for best quality.

1722,"I almost gave this only 3 stars, but as long as you know the limitation of this product and what it's for, it works like it's supposed to do. This is perfect for older cabinets without rails.

The worst part was the assembly which was more difficult than expected. Well, it wasn't THAT long because assembly took about 10-15 minutes, but the orientation of how the two metal bars fit with the two plastic parts was a bit challenging to figure out. Watch the video posted with the product so you can assemble this quicker. Also, make sure the four legs are inserted fully.

As for being ""adjustable,"" yes, the length can be extended, but you have to pull apart the two c-shaped white plastic parts apart, and it requires some force - don't expect this to slide like modern drawers. At its smallest setting. it's about the size of a cardboard bankers box. However, you can't use legal-sized hanging folders like you can with a bankers box because the rail works only one way for standard-sized hanging folders.

This does what it says it does. I'm glad to have an old cabinet be more functional. If I were using this on my desk (i.e. not inside a drawer), I'd only use it for files that won't have to be moved around from various locations; I'd use an actual container, instead of only the frame.",2,7.1954594

I have a strong photo and technology background with 19 years experience in photo, graphics, and computers & equipment--much of that as a working owner/manager in the business.

I've long been a happy Canon camera user, but I spent years dismayed at Canon's home printer selections and because I had such a low opinion of Canon home printers I only recently decided to try a Canon printer because my recent experiences with E***n have been more than frustrating.

My local photo lab sells this printer and they claimed it printed better than the E***n and N*****u equipment they use daily for customer orders. Frankly, this printer is very good. It is quiet--very quiet-especially when compared to any ** and any E***n I have used. But, the most important part is how well it prints and how accurate the color reproduction and black and whites are. Out of the box, installed and the first print without any adjustments came out almost perfect. That is a far cry from my E***n experiences.

I do photo restorations, photo editing and a number of other services that require just 1 or 2 prints per customer.

1734,"These worked nearly perfectly (4 stars) for laminating some cardstock signs I have.  I bought these because I didn't want the shiny glare of the non-matte pouches and they don't disappoint in that respect.  I couldn't get a glare off of them if I tried.  They're substantial and I believe that they'll really extend the life of the signs (for my classroom).

My ONLY complaint - and it could absolutely be the laminator that's to blame and not the pouches - is that I don't think that they completely adhered to the posters.  They're definitely attached but they almost seem to be in need of more heat for a longer period of time for full adhesion to the sign.  I haven't ruled out taking my iron to them (with some parchment paper to prevent the laminate from adhering to the iron). They're certainly sealed up and the laminate border around the 8 1/2 X 11"" signs is completely fused together, but the laminate doesn't seem to be really strongly ""melted"" to the actual poster.

1749,"I have nothing to say to commercial users except that its bigger than before, can hold engine blocks (plural) and the only improvement I can think of would be a locking wheel.

For homeowners who are thinking of this cart, well, it is tremendously strong for its weight, rolls easily on its ball-bearing  4 wheels, and can hold six kids taking it out and careening down the driveway (watch out for that). But what I want to emphaSIZE it that it is BIG. 24 wide may not sound like much; I was never good at taking measurements and translating them mentally into reality. Weve had Rubbermaid carts for over 30 years, and kind of expected this would be the narrower kind were used to, good for navigating down hallways. I changed my mind when I opened the box.

No. You want this cart for patios, for big yards with fairly smooth paths, big garages with space between your junk, and workshops. High-density structural foam construction has the word foam in it. Sounds pretty namby-pamby. It is not. It weighs about 40 pounds and feels lighter once it is on its very smooth wheels. And it is tremendously stiff without any cross-bracing. I was amazed.

It assembled in 24 minutes. The instructions are on the box (see Photo). Just six parts & 28 screws, which is 4 more than you need-- I appreciate that, Rubbermaid. Assembly calls for a screwdriver and a mallet for pounding in the legs. My mallet was helpful but you could use a piece of 2X4. I'd have put it together faster if Id ditched the manual screwdriver sooner and gone with my drill with a phillips bit from the start.  Disassembly took 9 minutes.

Disassembly? What, you thought I could use this thing? My condo association definitely could, I loaned this big beauty to my Brother-in-Law in Reno to see what he thought. This kind of cart would  be perfect for his new four car garage (where did he get the money?) and down the hill in his yard.  He says he' going to get two of them so there won't be any pushing uphill to do on his sloping property.  There is an outside driveway as the easy route to the yard. But he certainly won't be pushing it back UP loaded with potting soil or sacks of gravel.

One pair is the Officemate 8-inch scissors listed here; the other is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scotch-Precision-Ultra-Edge-Non-Stick-Scissor-8-Inch-Brown-with-Assorted-Accent-Colors-Dot-Color-Will-Vary-1468TUNS-MIX/dp/B002QUZNQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scotch Precision Ultra Edge Non Stick Scissor, 8-Inch, Brown with Assorted Accent Colors (Dot Color Will Vary) (1468TUNS-MIX)</a>, which costs several dollars more.  I was curious whether the extra cost translated into any tangible benefits.  The short answer is yes, but I'm not sure how much you'd see in normal use.

Both scissors came extremely sharp.  The Officemate has definitely a lower level of finish, with roughness from machining clearly evident on the inside surfaces of the blades (the ones that face each other).  The quality of finish on these surfaces affects the cutting edge and thus how the blades slide shut against each other.  A smoother surface translates to a smoother cutting edge and closing action.  Even when brand new, the Officemate scissors had a bit of roughness as the blades cut through paper.  The Scotch scissors were absolutely smooth as they closed together.  Both scissors, though, cut through paper cleanly and with minimal force.  It should also be mentioned that the inside surfaces of the Scotch scissors are coated with a clear non-stick layer...they almost feel like non-stick cookware.  I assume that it's this layer that leads to the non-stick claim.

Both scissors have screws at their pivot point to adjust the tension between the blades.  The Officemate uses a standard phillips head screw; the Scotch uses a more expensive-looking machined slotted screw.  Both work fine to adjust any play between the blades...the difference is appearance, not function.

The blades on both are exactly 8"" long from pivot to tip.  The handle side on the Scotch is about 1/2""+ longer, which provides more room for your fingers.  The tips of the Scotch blades are rounded.  The Officemate's tips are sharp, but thick; they aren't finely pointed like you'd find in precision scissors.

All in all, both scissors work just fine, but I'll give the nod to Scotch.  It's better built and I like that in my tools.",23,14.457716

1761,"The Velcro brand is not exaggerating calling these fasteners ""Industrial Strength.""  All too often, brands will make an ""extra strength"" version of their main product, that ends up not being very different, if at all.  But these Velcro fasteners are far beyond the quality and strength of regular Velcro brand fasteners.  I am extremely impressed with their strength!

I purchased one of those hangable, mesh screen curtains to put in my sliding glass doorway to my apartment balcony that doesn't have a screen.  My ceilings are taller than standard, so no screen door on the market would fit my very tall sliding glass doorway.  The mesh screen curtains came with a few pieces of Velcro fasteners enclosed, but after installing one and having it fall down overnight, I was very frustrated.  I would have nailed the thing to my wall or ceiling, but the way my door is positioned, it is all metal doorframe around it, impossible to use nails with.  After browsing Amazon I found these ""Industrial Strength"" Velcro brand fasteners and hoped they would work.

They worked brilliantly!  These fasteners have extremely dense, tightly woven pieces of each type, that can hold a lot of weight.  The adhesive on the back is also industrial strength, and will stay put wherever you stick it, without falling down or even starting to peel off a tiny bit.  One word of advice - be sure where you want to stick these before you stick them on a wall, because once they're applied to the wall, they are extremely difficult to remove (I had to use a knife to pry a piece from the wall and I had only stuck it there moments earlier).  These Velcro fasteners have kept my mesh screen curtain in place perfectly.  In fact, they worked so well that I decided to install additional mesh curtains in some of my other very tall windows that do no have screens.  Out of 3 mesh screen curtains I have installed in my apartment with these Velcro fasteners, none have budged even a millimeter, despite recent storms with heavy wind.  So if you need to hang something heavy with Velcro but are worried whether the Velcro will hold, buy these and you won't be disappointed.

1764,"If I seem overly enthusiastic, it's because I'm so rarely blown away by products like this. This headrest matches the Aeron in more than appearances. It's engineered to move with you yet supporting your head without drifting. You can pull it up with your hands behind your head without effort. Just pull it to meet your head. Too high? Use your head to push it to the position you want, and it stays until you push it again. It's perfectly balanced. This makes my chair into the chair I wished for before I bought it. The Aeron Work Stool is so fantastic in its own right that I forgave it for not having a headrest. But I wanted one, nonetheless. When I saw this one, I bought it immediately just out of hope that it's not some piece of junk. It arrived two days later, and I had it on the chair within 3 minutes of bringing it in the door. That's all there is to it. It just worked.

I figured at best that I'd find a position for it, wrench it into that position, and there it would stay. It turns out that I change positions of the headrest almost as often as I change my own position in the chair. That's because it is so easy to put where it works best, regardless of your position. Just pull on it from behind you and it stretches up, then you can move it down again easily into the perfect spot for that moment.

I haven't had it long enough to know if it gets loose over time, but there are easy instructions for tightening it, should that happen. It even comes with spare end-plugs in case you mess up the installed ones taking them out to tighten it.

My only wish for the headrest that does not already exist is that it had come in different colors, like the Aeron itself. I have a platinum chair, and it would have been nice to have that color option. But I really don't care. It does not look bad as-is. But hopefully in the future they come up with more colors.

I especially like the 1.0 mm black because it is bold, which works well when writing notes that I want to copy later. Just know that the lines are thick so you may have to write more clearly than when using the .5 or .7 mm gel pens. I really looked around at different pens and until my daughter gifted me with the Sarasa Zebra gel pens, I hadn't found much that I liked. I like these.

I tried 12 sheets at once with this, and it trimmed nicely and evenly. (The manufacturer claims that it can cut up to 30 sheets of 20lb paper). The built quality is very nice, especially the wooden board is very solid and heavy. The handle is rubberized nicely, and it is much better than a regular plastic handle. Grid, ruler, and the safety lock is all standard on trimmers, but I liked the safety guard that is clear plastic on this. I could see better where the paper edge lines under the safety guard. And if I need to remove the safety guard, I can pop it out and use the trimmer without the safety guard.
Westcott makes good scissors so I trust the blade quality, and I am sure this one will last for a long time. One thing I wish they included with this product is the warranty on blade.

1772,"Excellent device - but set-up can be very difficult and frustrating

I own and have used two OBi202 devices for several years.  Configuration for Google Voice was relatively simple and the devices worked well for telephone > OBi202 > Google Voice > free US calls.

Since Google recently (May 2014) disabled XMPP support, which was used to provide the OBi202 > Google Voice link, it was necessary to find another VoIP SIP provider to replace Google Voice.  There are at least a couple dozen VoIP carriers that can provide inbound and/or outbound services of the OBi (and other SIP-compliant ATA devices.)  ""BYOD"" (bring-your-own-device) is a common acronym the carriers use to promote this usage.

Among the carriers there are a wide range of bundled/package and pay-per-call plans.  The costs, features, and reputation of the carriers vary widely.  One of the biggest surprises to me is that you can get inbound and/or outbound lines separately.  (I had always incorrectly assumed that if you could make inbound and outbound calls on any telephone line.)

Configuring the OBi for the new SIP account using OBiTalk's web-based portal is where the problems with the OBi device began.  I spent many, many hours searching the OBi, DSLreports, and other forums trying to resolve problems.  I eventually ended up deleting the devices from my existing OBiTalk account and opening a new (clean) OBiTalk account.  After doing factory resets, etc., of the devices, I was able to successfully get them to work on the new account.

From the various OBi and VoIP forums, I learned that other OBi device users have had mixed results in moving to other VoIP carriers.  Some users have had no problems, others have had significant problems.  It appears that on the OBiTalk server there are databases, and when users connect, there are configuration scripts which are run.  Additionally, OBi device memory and device firmware also are involved, and your local PC's browser cache can also provide misleading information.  The OBi staff are trying to address the various problems as quickly as they can -- which means lots of script patches are being added to the system behind the scenes -- which may, or may not, cause other problems.

My guess is that the experience of OBi device users will improve over time as the OBi staff resolves the various problems.  Until then, OBi users can expect some ""bumps in the road.""

1779,"I didn't buy these off Amazon for $7 for the two-pack. My local WalMart sells the same two-pack for around $4.

Dimensionally, the F-301 bold is the same size as the regular F-301 Ballpoint pen. It measures 5-1/4"" long and 3/8"" in diameter. The body of the pen and the tip are stainless steel; the clicker is plastic with metallic accents. The grip is textured black plastic, 1-1/8"" long. A clip is installed and can't be removed unless you break it off. It doesn't rotate. When inserted in a pocket, 1/2"" of the pen sticks out. The pen unscrews right below the grip to refill. A drop of lubricant will keep the threads clean and squeak-free. If you decide you don't like the F-301 in Bold, it can accept a normal Zebra F-series ballpoint refill. The opposite is also true: the F-301 ballpoint can use the Bold refill with no problems.

In use, the F-301 Bold works very well. It writes as smoothly as any other Zebra, and the bold line resembles a gel pen's line. The pen writes fluidly on most materials as long as they're not greasy or glossy (photographs, for example). I did notice a few gobs of ink coming out when the pen wasn't being used for long periods, but that's to be expected from a tip of this size. There's not a lot more to say. It's just a good pen.

1783,"Overall, this is a very nice printer. It's a very good choice for someone who does mainly (or entirely) low volume color work. It's geared toward the home user/low end hobbyist and hits the mark quite well. It's not targeted to high end hobbyist/semi-pro or professional printers  - you'll have to step up a bit in the Epson line for that. But if you're a home user and want to work with larger format paper, give this a hard look.

 Set up is (thankfully) a breeze -- good instructions that are easy to follow and, more importantly, easy to install software that works the first time (at least on XP - have not tried it on a Vista machine). Build quality is very solid -- the paper guides feel substantial (not all that common at this price point) as does the overall printer. Ink installation is fool-proof since the cartridges won't fit in the wrong slot.

So far, I've been very pleased with the color output using Photoshop. Epson claims that the printhead is a new design that provides more detail. While I'm not one of those who peers at prints with a magnifying glass, to my eye the output was equal to that produced by my higher-end printers (Both Epson and Canon). The key to working well with any printer is to profile your monitor and printer using something such as the ColorMunki (there are several other options as well).

The down sides to this printer are in its B/W work. I didn't expect a whole lot from it since it does not have the dedicated black cartridges as the 2400 or 3800. True to form, B/W prints from the 1400 have a color cast. You can tweak it to minimize it, but a perfectly neutral B/W print is a challenge to produce with this printer. If you do mainly color work, you'll be happy with this printer. If you do a lot of B/W work, you should look elsewhere.

The ink cartridges are on the small side, but that can be a good thing if you don't run a lot of volume through the printer. Inks do go bad if they sit for a long time unused, so a smaller cartridge ensures you'll empty the ink in a timely manner. Of course, this works against you if you're doing a lot of prints, since larger cart's are less costly per ounce. While you can save money with third party refills, it can be a false economy -- while some are just as good as Epson inks, others will produce sub-par results (at best) and can really foul up the printer with clogs. If you're willing to spend the money for the printer, you should figure in the cost of using Epson inks.

An unexpected treat was the noise, or rather, lack thereof. Very quiet running.

In short, this is a very good choice for low volume color work with the flexibility for larger formats, and delivers prints that look like they came from a much more expensive printer.",7,9.45055

The pockets are small and shallow, so don't expect to put books in these. Also, the product does not come with nails or hooks so you have to find and install those on your own.  Also, it does not come with labels - the packaging is a little ambiguous on that but no, you have to create your own labels.  But these are just totally minor issues.

The product is solidly made and easy to use (once you remember its limitations).  Each pocket has a clear plastic label compartment. It's flexible and light.

1798,"This is a versatile black & white laser printer that also scans, photocopies, and can send/receive faxes.  Although billed as business printer, I believe it would function well in the home or school context. Here's what I view as the advantages and disadvantages of this model:

Advantages

1. Impressively quick printing speed.  This is where laser printers have an enormous advantage over inkjet printers.  The specs for the Brother DCP-L5600DN advertise speeds of up to 42 pages per minute, and I believe it... that printer is FAST!

2.  Ease of setup.  Unlike other electronic products I've dealt with in the past, the ""Quick Setup Guide"" was concise, clear, and easy to follow.  You basically have to pull off a bunch of pieces of blue tape, remove a silica pack and foam cushioning from the toner cartridge area, plug it in, run a setup program from the provided disc, and you're all set.  The time from starting to open the box to printing out my first sample page was probably no more than 15-20 minutes.

3.  Top document feeder.  One nice feature of this printer that others lack is a document feeder on the top, so if you're trying to make a copy of a manuscript or other stack of papers, you don't have to stand there and place the sheets one at a time on the copier.  A huge time saver.

4.  Can print double-sided, a big plus if you're trying to conserve on paper.

5.  Includes adjustable trays for inserting envelopes, non-standard paper sizes, etc.

6.  Controls are straightforward and easy to operate.  The printer has one button (power), and everything else is handled through a touch screen that was intuitive to use--no fumbling around trying to figure out how to navigate sub-screens or functions.

Disadvantages:

1.  This printer is black and white only, and cannot print or duplicate in color.

2.  The plastic tray parts for document feeding seem a bit flimsy. I haven't had the printer long enough to determine its durability, but it seemed as if some of the parts could break or snap off under heavy handling.

So, in the crowded field of printers, should you pick this one?  In my opinion, it depends entirely on how badly you want or need color printing capability.  If that's not important to you, then this is a fine printer, and I'm guessing it would be more economical in the long run to operate, as the black-only toner cartridges are cheaper and seem to last longer in my experience than the multi-pack cartridges you have to buy with color printers. (And here I will register dissatisfaction with the Epson Artisan printer I have used in the past; it seems like I was constantly having to buy new cartridges for that thing.)

If you want a color printer, I'd recommend checking out the Dell H825cdw series... It's the printer I have in my home office and has done a great job for me in the past six months.",8,14.214054
1799,"Perfect for tucking in your pocket or purse, so thin and flexible, but strong--they hold up well. Sort of a versatile ""diary"" to record random information. I like the plain (no lines) so I can draw a diagram or write small or large or whatever. Since this slips so easily into almost anything I carry, I always have something permanent to make a note in, which is easily retrieved later.  And the pocket on the back inside cover can hold business cards, stamps, etc..
Also, for an organizational system, I bought several packs of these in different colors to record information for reference. I label these ""Health"" (enter symptoms, visits, tests, etc. with dates), ""Guests"" (include dates and menus), ""Weight"" (if I'm keeping track!),""Auto"" (what and when repairs were done), ""Computer"" (problems to have my kid teach me how to deal with when he visits!), etc.--you get the idea.

That pen disappeared with a backpack and got this one as a replacement, but I find this Rapidosketch terribly inadequate.

But at least it produces a consistent line, more then I can say about the Rapidosketch 3x0 I bought at the same time.

Update: Seller said that I had waited too long to use the pen and find the problem.  Called Chartpak (US distributor of many fine arts products, including Koh-I-Noor), they said they would could replace it if it was a RapidoGraph, but not a RapidoSketch.  They provide no warranty support for the RapidoSketch.

1804,"I cannot recommend this printer!  Why Oh Why do companies have to put out new machines every year, when they have already made the perfect product??  I had a Canon Pixma  MP610 that I bought about 6-8 years ago, and it was PERFECT.  Couldn't improve on it.  The most beautiful photos.  Easy operation  Quick printing, I mean literally within seconds of turning it on.  Never messed up with the paper.  The starter on it finally died, and I had to get another machine, and would happily have gotten another of the same model if they still made them!  I wailed and whined.
I got this new 7720 in white and I like the color and the looks of it, but am not happy with the operation at all.  It clicks, humms, whirs, clicks and hums some more and eventually prints what you want.  Then it clicks, hums, whirs some more.  Takes forever.  I also don't like that it doesn't have a back slot for paper, instead it has two drawers underneath, and each time you open them, you must ""register"" what kind of paper you have inside.  If I wanted to copy something on both sides (like notes from a notebook), it's really a pain to keep opening the drawer to put the paper  back in and then register the paper again, over and over.  Furthermore, with my old printer, I exclusively used the back slot for paper, so I could put things in front of the printer (like a stapler), now I can't, because of having to open the drawer underneath all the time.  I also can't see when the paper is low, I just get the ""memo"" when it's out.
Further, this is a ""touch screen"" dash for operating anything, like those electric stoves that only have a circle where the burners are.  It's not particularly responsive, It's basically invisible unless it decides to light up. I have to jab some ""buttons"" over and over to get anything to happen, and it's not always easy to see exactly where you should ""push"".  Not a good touch screen.
It wasn't hard to set up, but in  doing so, I got some nasty little add-ons that were the DEVIL to get rid of!  I almost had to take it to a computer shop to get one particularly bad one off.  Couldn't use the computer for the pop-ups that kept coming on.  So, beware!
Also, I can't make heads or tails of the short cut that comes with it for working with your photos, editing them, etc.  I have my own set up, I don't need theirs and I don't want it.  It  hogs space and takes time to come up.
Oh, another negative!  It often picks up two sheets of paper when printing, especially if I've just put in one sheet of photo paper on top of plain, and therefore it prints on the plain, wasting my time and my ink.  So infuriating!  And, then I have to go back to putting more paper in and registering it again.

1805,Ok first of all these pencils are different than what you are used .....the colors are different and the way the color lays down is different.  The colors are mostly muted and alot of them don't show up on regular copier paper very well but they are PERFECT for the Bassford coloring books and they also are great for more textured paper for artists who use colored pencils to draw.  The lead is very hard so you have to layer alot but you don't get a waxy bloom like you do with most wax based pencils.

It's got all the features we need, too: wifi support, automatic duplex printing, ability to load lots of paper in the main tray, cheap ink, ability to feed in envelopes and card stock manually.

The scanning also does what we needed it to, which is to scan documents for archive - letters, bills, etc.  In other words, we didn't care about photo quality particularly, just needed to be able to save an image.  It's a good thing we didn't care about quality, though, because the few times we have tried to use it for something where we cared about how it looked, it was terrible.  See my user photo for the product -- it started as an 8x10 glossy photo in good shape and of decent quality.  Scanned at 600 dpi to jpg.  The result was discoloration, blotchiness, scan lines, streaking, etc.  Really awful.

I'm only dinging it one star for that because we have an Epson perfect photo scanner for that purpose...but anyone thinking they are getting a good general purpose scanner should be aware.

I became allergic to earplugs made of EVERYTHING (even hypoallergenic ones!), and saw someone mention he uses this for earplugs. Son of a gun: it totally works! I make a cone-shaped blob, push it into my ear, and then use the end of a pen to push it in a bit further. NB: Do NOT make a long, pointy tip like I did the first time: I ended up in an urgent care clinic begging for someone to remove the stuff from my eardrums. This was NOT fun (it was scary as hell!), so now I'm careful to make blunt cone shapes.

I also use it to hold up polymer clay items in the oven which are in danger of tipping over, holding things still which need not to move (e.g., antennas), and even in the failing seal on my fridge.

1842,"Several years ago I purchased a Panasonic phone system because it had the ability to block 30 unwanted callers.  Now comes the KTG7873S which can block 250.  That's right, 250.  Avoid telemarketers or any undesirables by adding their number to your master list & you'll be a happy camper.  You can even set the preferences so that your phone will not ring when they call (previous models, the phone would ring once and CALL BLOCKED would appear in the caller ID)  The call block feature, by itself, makes this system a real gem.  The other features are also top notch:  very easy to setup, variety of ring tones, intercom system, just two AAA rechargeable batteries for each handset, robot voice featuring incoming call identification (you can turn this on or off at your pleasure), and you can setup your mobile phone to do its thing through your new Panasonic system.  (Not having a cell phone I can't comment on the quality of that particular aspect of this system.  As an aside - I love tech things - computers, laptops, new software - anything and everything tech related.  I absolutely detest mobile/cell phones.  I refuse to have one.  Never have, never will.  Some would say I need therapy.  My idea of hell includes being buried under a pile of ringing, tooting, blaring cell phones that go 24/7.  Finally,  I saved about $25 by purchasing this at the Amazon warehouse.  Absolutely no flaws except missing batteries.  One email to customer service fixed that issue - fast.  Bottom line:  I am impressed by Panasonic taking the initiative and listening to consumers who are tired of being disturbed at dinner time, bed time, early time by unwanted phone calls from unknown people hawking unneeded products.

1. Sometimes prints again, unsolicited, when the computer boots up again. This is bad when it contains sensitive personal info, like bank account numbers. Even when I wait a few minutes after printing before shutting down the computer.
2. The paper slides in the magazine tray, giving the ""out-of-paper"" alert flashes. Have to keep sliding the paper back up, and resetting the magazine. This happens frequently, even though the printer is on a level surface.
3. Pictures need to be edited with a lot of contrast added before they print right. Unedited the pictures look all washed out, like the overall color cast bled all over the page.

Otherwise, it's great. Really duplexes, no user intervention required (if the paper in the magazine doesn't slide). However, you must install the HP software to get the duplexer to work, the standard Windows 7 print driver won't do it (wired Ethernet connected).",2,7.015285

- multi-page docs can be scanned as one document (you don't have to chain the pages together manually)
- scans docs in varying sizes (max width is unfortunately 8.5"")

As a point of note to users: My printer told me I should replace SOON.  Having read varying reports regarding this product's compatibility specifically with the 6920 I decided to ""test"" the new cartridge on arrival.  My thought was to ensure that the printer would accept it and then put the old cartridge BACK into the printer to use the rest of the ink.  Three unsuccessful tries and I gave up.  When I put the new YoYoInk cartridge back in place it still recognized it as a ""new"" cartridge.

1862,"I have owned many pencil sharpeners over the years.  However, without exception, the sharpeners would completely fail or lose some performance after only a few months.

I am more hopeful than I have been yet, after several weeks with the X-Acto Teacher Pro Sharpener.  While I am not using the sharpener in a classroom environment, obviously any high-use environment whether home, the classroom, or office setting is what this sharpener is designed to tackle.  The pencil shavings canister is the largest I have seen.  This keeps one from having to waste time, emptying the container several times a day or week.  It can simply be emptied on a more reasonable schedule, without a worry of the shavings backing up and hindering the sharpening.

Furthermore, the point that the sharpener puts on the end of the pencil is fantastic.  It's ""just right,""  Plenty sharp, without being on the verge of breaking.  The sharpener tries to deter a user from sharpening too long, by having an indicator light come on at the top of the sharpener, and a cutoff, when the sharpening is complete.  A great feature, and I would imagine, great for children who I have witnessed sharpening a pencil much too long.

Obviously, there is an adjustment on the front of the sharpener for pencil size as well, if you happen to use an abnormally thick or thin pencil.  Most of us will simply leave it on the most common setting.

Overall, I am quite impressed by X-Acto's offering.  It seems obvious that the company's goal was to design a sharpener that could better handle high use situations.  I am holding the fifth star as I wait and see if it truly does hold up better.  However, it's looking quite good.  Recommended Product.",3,9.07391

I'm old enough to remember when index cards were a household staple, used for everything under the sun; while not indestructible, they could be reused and dog-earred and still serve their purpose. A recent project required I buy these... and while I was prepared for the poor quality based on previous reviews, I ended up kicking myself for not just buying a good packet of 24lb printer paper. Why? Because I ended up having to GLUE TWO CARDS TOGETHER just to make these strong enough to accommodate my needs. My stack of 100 cards turned into 50 thanks to a glue stick. Ug. Flimsy and thin, and practicality see-through, thy name is Oxford.

It's very user friendly and I'd say it took me longer to open the box and unpack it than it did to set it up and get it running!

What's very cools is that the machine aligns up the printing by itself.  Put a paper through once, it prints on it then you put that SAME paper through again face down and it aligns up ALL by itself!

The only thing I'd give a warning for is to make sure you by a USB cable (not included) AND buy a black HP #21 and color HP #22 ink cartridge extra as even through they're included they're ""test"" cartridges and there is VERY little ink  in them.

Buyers should also know that this pen produces a very fine line--significantly finer than the Pilot Precise V5 pen, which I like. I was so unhappy with these pens that I threw them in the trash. If I wrote slowly and carefully, I got an acceptable line, but I want to be able to write quickly too. Also, note that this pen does not have a clip to hold it in your shirt pocket. It has a little plastic loop in the cap. Maybe this is so you could put a piece of string through it for carrying it with you?? Strange. I love pens and writing with different pens and the feelings and imagination that go with them, but I wonder who uses that plastic loop and what they do with it.

I use it for weighing items only to 0.1 accuracy and it is spot on--I have several items of known weights and the variance has not been more than 0.01--namely something that is 'supposed' to be 1.2 grams was 1.19, and that is most likely a factor of the expected tolerance in the manufacturing and wear/tear factors (I'm talking post-WWII era Japanese coins).

My previous scale (which gave up the ghost and in retrospect I'm glad it did) was much more costly, much more finicky and had an annoying shape to the weighing platform.  This is smooth, sleek and the controls are easy.

Another nice feature is that the instructions are on the inner lid, and the printed ones that came with it, are very short, simple and don't presume extreme stupidity on the part of the consumer--""please don't use while standing on train tracks as vibrations will interfere with accuracy and collisions may be fatal""--nope that warning was NOT present thankfully.

Just make sure you have a calibration weight--100 grams.  This was also easily obtained from Amazon (and with prime shipping).  My previous scale had a 'zero' button, not a real calibration, so this is a nice step up.

They are pretty flat, so, if you use a photo print, you can even stick them on the locking panels that open and close.  You can put heavier stuff in them too, and hang them in a place where they don't need to be flat.  The 4 nice sized velcro circles (one in each corner) give you good stick-a-bility.  You can slide one document in and take another out with no problem.  You can use them horizontally or vertically.  No hassle, Mate!

I just redecorated my work cubie.  Directly in front of me, I placed photos of me having fun (riding horses, playing drums, swimming with a dolphin, standing on the bow of the prop from the Titanic with my arms in the wind, etc. and work awards.  The idea is self-motivation at work. To the left, I put photos of relatives.  To the right, I put photos of my favorite singer. In other strategic places I put motivational posters I made and instructions for some work processes I need to access quickly.

These are a must have for a cubicle dweller!",4,9.245749
1889,"I have been using this product for over a year. I am not giving you experience from a week, or a month, but for consistent use over the period of more than a year.

You might think that file tabs are more thing of the past, but in many cases these days, they re still a necessity. I've run my own business for over 10 years now, and though I now digitize many documents, there are a great many which need to be kept in their original form therefore I have an awful lot of paper documents that need to be filed on a regular basis (I wish that were not the case living in the digital age).

What I was looking for most with this item:
- the fact that they were ""Re-positionable""
- that they would ""Not Smudge"" when written on this, especially with the gel pen
- there was enough tabs of each color, so that you could create some sense of ""Order""

Re-positionable:
I have to say, this is one of the best features of the product. File folders or something that get reused in our office, but tabs typically do not. With old file systems, you were forced to insert the paper label between the plastic tab, and slide the tab between two paper slots on the inside of the file folder. The other issue, was that if you relabeled file folders ,you would have to remove the tab from the paper slots, and reinsert them each time you have to relabel. This resulted in significant wear, as file folders are only paper, and over time the file labels would not necessarily stay put, falling into the cabinet.

This 3M tab, solves that problem very well. The tasks are not too difficult to reposition, yet they seem to stay in place very well. In many cases, we reposition tabs so that they are easy to read in a file drawer. For example, we will position the tabs so they can be easily read, diagonally without having to walk through the entire file cabinet to find particular item you're looking for. The ability to reposition the task, without tearing up the folder is a huge plus.

Smudging:
Another problem with many file tabs on the market, is if you use certain pens, such as gel pens and sometimes Sharpies they will easily smudge. That is not the case with these3m tabs, as far as I've found. Although I say this with one caveat, depending on the brand of gel pen, you may find that they do sometimes smudge. I found that this is more often the case with the particular ink than it is with the fact that you're using a gel pen. With that in mind, I would not consider that a downside. One of the great things about these tabs is you can also use a pencil and it seems to do well.

Colors:
What I like about these 3M Tabs, is that they provide a reasonable amount of color to create order in the filing cabinet, without getting too crazy. Many other brands provide crazy neon colors and only a few of each, which makes it very difficult if you use a color coding system in your files. 3M seems to have hit it just about right with these, They give you half dozen of each of the colors they provide, in my case it was four. My hope is that they offer one or two additional columns in the future, but I do not f the four colors I have to be too much of a big deal.  The benefits far outweigh the drawbacks.

All in all, if you are like us, and are forced to do paperwork filing in the digital age, these come in really handy and I can't recommend them enough. They will allow you to reuse your paper files longer.",2,8.452052

Either way, it still works and is good enough.  For something that measures up to 110lbs it's pretty dang accurate, especially considering that I can check 3oz packages on it.

HOWEVER, although I have had good luck with the 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 inch rings, the much larger ones (like 3in) are made of the same gauge (i.e., thickness) of steel, which is not stiff enough for reliable locking.  In fact, some are quite loose and will pull apart too easily.",3,7.608269

While I found some stuff I really liked about these sticks, the stuff I don't like in fact the critical dislike, far outweighs the positives.

Positives:
a) No smell, no flavour, no mess (yes, I sniffed and licked and rubbed the glue stick).
b) relatively easy to use

Negatives:
1) Weak adhesive power, even if both sides daubed (but see note below)
2) invisible when applied so difficult to see how much has gone on (might be useful to use the purple disappearing glue but see note above)

I changed to this style of glue from traditional elmer's because the latter is a bit messy at times but it sure does stick well.
I will use these sticks up, along with scotch tape to ensure the labels stay, but switch to something else asap.

Other people in my office couldn't figure it out either and told me to throw it in the trash. The pictures on the inside of the package do not help.

The trick is they do not really stay in there on their own when you initially hook them into the basket and flop out, which makes you think you aren't wrapping them in correctly. The tension of locking the basket above to the top of the post is what holds it together.

1905,"I've been researching the different phones quite heavily. Some of the more profound findings were from on the floor sales staff at major office supply stores. The first store, he mentioned that the Panasonic was the best, and that Uniden, and V tech were junk. The second store I went to, he was a lot more specific, and really knew his stuff. He said that Unidens were the best voice and transmission quality, but didn't hold up. He also said the V techs were junk. His comment about the Panasonics was, I am not going to lie to you, they last forever, and have excellent overall quality, but you are going to pay more for that. He was emphatic about explaining that, his comment was intended for the full size Panasonic 5.8s, not the new little tiny 5.8 Panasonics, that are having problems, more like the V-techs.
A friend of mine has the Vtech 5.8, and has already had to return two handsets due to malfunctions. He also mentioned that when he presses a number to dial, it doesn't always register, and he has to press it again. I speak with him on the phone though, and even though he is outside his house, the quality is great.
My personal comments on the Panasonic 5.8 6502B is that I love the whole system. The quality is great. I get absolutely no static, or noise, even when my head is practically inside the microwave. (Which is the first thing I wanted to check after using my 2.4 and 900 megahertz that way and got so much noise I had to leave the room) Going outside of the stone house, I went all the way past my neighbor's front yard, before I got noise, and that is about 100 feet. I can go anywhere in the house, which is a 60 foot house, meaning that 40 feet is the max distance from the base unit, and everything is crystal clear, no matter what floor I am on. I have the base unit sitting on top of a major subwoofer.
I am a Panasonic fan, because I have a 900Mghz dual line, and a 2.4Ghz single line cordless, both of them Panasonics, and I have owned them for 10 years or more, and they both work perfectly. I had to buy replacement batteries for the older 900, which is the one that is over 10 years old. I bought replacements-aftermarket from eBay and they work great. My 2.4 is still running off of the original batteries. Not a glitch with either of those phones. That is reliability.
Now I want to talk about headsets. The dream from way back was to be able to walk around cordless, and better yet, hands free. I can go out in the garage, out in the yard, (go to the bathroom) get something to drink, or whatever I want, without being tied to the cord, and just as important, not having to bend my neck to hold the phone up, or use up a hand. Total freedom is great. The problem is that my headsets for the 900 or 2.4 don't work properly with the 5.8Ghz. I tried the Plantronics 25 or 29-dollar model, and it was so quiet, when I left a message on the answering machine, it would hang up. I tried my old headset, and it did the same thing. So their is something about 5.8 systems that require more volume. The reviews on the Panasonic headsets were many, but not many on the 5.8 volume problem. Those that were happy didn't report what they were using them on.
Once again, my Staples expert, the rare sales person who really knows what they are talking about, pointed me away from Plantronics, and aimed me directly at the AT&T Executive headset model number EHS30 for only $19.95. He said they were loud, and when hearing, you have to turn down the volume. The Plantronics he stated were for business use, when you don't want the caller hearing ten other conversations going on in the background. On the AT&T headset pack, they say,"" Designed for the HOME office professional"" Anyhow, I took it home, plugged it in, and it WORKS GREAT FOR THE 5.8. I sent a message to another answering machine in the house and the volume was greater than when using the regular phone, and without any distortion. It had great sound quality, and plenty of it. The AT&T has enough boom length, to get in front of your mouth. On the Plantronics, in frustration, I took the headset off, and spoke directly into the mic, but although I got more volume, there was distortion.
This paragraph is an edit to my original review. I have since received the Panasonic KX-TCA60 headset that everyone raves about, but others commented that they do not work with the 5.8s. Well they do. It does say on the cardboard plackett that the headset comes on, that they were meant for 900Mghz, and 2.4s but leaves out the 5.8s. BUT the owners manual for the 6502 says that headset works fine, and it does. The boom mic is crystal clear, just like the AT&T, and the volume on the ear piece is just the right volume. The AT&T goes above the normal volume, but gives you an adjustable volume knob to tweak it just right. The Panasonic TCA60 does not have a volume knob but is set at just the right volume already. The speaker on the AT&T is the same outside diameter cushion, but the actual speaker opening is twice the size of the Panasonic. That may help in part as to why the volume on the AT&T is greater. If you were in a really loud room, the AT&T has a higher volume adjustability. Both were perfect quality, sound and plenty of it. You can't go wrong with either one. The AT&T is twice the price of the Panasonic but is built a little more substantially. Hey get both, you have a lot of stations with the 6502.
One last comment is on looks. The picture of the individual handsets, the Panasonic 650 is more like the real look of the phone. If you look at the 6502B picture, it looks like pure black, which it is not. I prefer the pearl black metallic/off charcoal gray look, which it shows you in the 650 handset only picture here at Amazon, which is what it all is and has a black back. Also the LCD color they show in that picture is not accurate; it is more like a goldish yellow instead.
Overall, I find the 6502B or 6500 with a single handset, which are full size Panasonics, to be the best looking, most functional, and most reliable units out there. I have absolutely no complaints at all. Pertaining to the comments about the calls missed showing up on all of the handsets; when you have multiple people using the same system, everyone has a chance to review all of the incoming calls, and with the caller ID, they show up with the sending phone number and time of the call. If someone else like a brother or sister, erased your message at the base, or from their handset, you know what calls came in, and who to holler at :-)
Get the Panasonic 6502B or 6500, and get the AT&T headset EH530, which also works in your cell phone with the same 2.5mm plug. Buy it, you won't be sorry. I seriously feel a pang of love when I walk past the handset stations, especially, when I consider all of the old problems this new system solves.
Oh, one more thing, I have the primary line set up on my Lingo line, that I learned about here at Amazon. It's the new VOIP and costs me only $19.95 a month for unlimited long distance all over the US, Canada, and 17 countries in Western Europe. The included premium call services including Caller ID all work beautifully with the Panasonic system. I guess you could say, ""I'm phone happy"" Hope this helps.",149,14.454829

The pencil is genuine, it's just like the other one I bought by itself. Really nice pencil and I love the click feature, protects the thin tip. I always drop my Zebra M301s and they have never broken, but I am always afraid they will especially since the part encasing the tip is plastic. Of course dropping at least half the time occurs when writing.. but still some extra protection that is not usually there.

1917,"This item was delivered without any instructions. Searching the internet, I found several sets of instructions. Basically, the diagrams shown for this product describes the procedure.
1. Using a small flat screwdriver, pry open the door on the side of the toner cartridge. Then remove the plug with needle nose pliers. I accidentally broke the door when I removed the plug, but the door is not necessary.
2. Empty out any remaining toner in the cartridge. Several sites indicate an incompatibility between different brands of toner and may cause streaking when printing. Just pour it out the opening and shake it to ensure all of it is out. No matter how hard you try, you will get toner on everything, so do it in an area where you don't mind getting dirty. I did it in my workshop. Some sites indicate that the cartridge should be vacuumed out. I did not and it worked fine.
3. To make it easier to fill, I held the cartridge upright with a quick clamp, but you can use some bricks or some books to hold it up. Remember that toner dust will be everywhere. Make a paper funnel and place it in the fill hole. The paper funnel will form to the shape of the hole. Just make sure you hold or tape it down, or you will get toner coming out between the funnel and the cartridge. I did not use the pour spout and just poured it directly from the bottle. This minimizes the toner dust.
4. Put the plug back in and turn the cartridge sideways a few times to distribute the toner.
5. Place the new chip OVER the sensor contacts, with the arrows pointing up when the cartridge is installed. Some websites show you how to remove the old chip, but that is not necessary. The spring loaded contacts will accommodate the additional height of the new chip. The chip has some double sided tape on the back to secure it. If you are refilling the cartridge a second time, you will need to remove the old replacement chip or it will be too high for the contacts.

Print results were great - it was as good as the original cartridge. I only replace the toner in the black cartridge since that was the only one that was empty. The entire bottle of toner fit in the cartridge, even though it claims 2500 page yield and the original claims 1500 pages. Not sure if the entire bottle will fit in the smaller color cartridges.

The only negative is that the items were placed loosely in a bubble wrap envelope (no box or second envelope) and two of the soft plastic bottles were crushed a bit. Nothing spilled though. Item was purchased from simplyitem.

Update June 2017: I finally refilled the color cartridges. They all ""ran out"" at the same time. I'm guessing that the chip indicates that they are out, but they are not really out. Upon taking the toner out of the original envelope, I found that the yellow cartridge was leaking. This must have been from the original crushed bottles. I attempted to fill it the same way as the black cartridge, but had lots of problems. The ink powder would not flow into the funnel and I had to push it in with a stick. Obviously, the toner went everywhere. I believe the problem is because I did not shake the bottle first (due to the leak).
For the other two bottles, I omitted the funnel and used the provided spout. This worked fine and I found that the funnel was not necessary. Shaking the bottle helped tremendously - the toner flowed out as though it was a liquid and made very little mess.
Although the color cartridges were smaller than the black cartridge, the toner was able to fit in the cartridge - barely. For one cartridge, I had the shake it slightly to get the last bit of toner in. Don't shake it vigorously or the toner will come out the side.
I still highly recommend this refill.",2,14.464856

1926,"The stapler is bigger than I had expected, it has a space age look that says ""I'm all business"". Someone obviously put some effort into the overall clean-line design.

Basically, it was easy to open and put the staples in, that is once I understood how the staple chamber opened. Most staplers operate by lifting the handle but this one you push a button and pull the staple chamber forward and out from the front. A few more package directions would have been nice, as I hate pushing and pulling on any new equipment for fear of damaging it without trying. It did a great job of stapling the 10 page test I experimented on.

The funny thing is, I now own four Swingline staplers. One small desk model I have had probably 50 years, which still staples as well as the day it was purchased even though it doesn't do over 8 or 9 pages. It was bought when the boys started school. I have a long arm Swingline which is great for what it is intended, but a little awkward for sitting on a desk. Then there is the Swingline purchased about 7 years ago that was not working, and a total aggravation. After getting a price to have it repaired I decided it would be cheaper to buy a new one. I debated whether to even purchase another Swingline but I'm a sucker for a lifetime guarantee.

So here is this beauty, but on the day it arrived I had decided on trying to repair the one that didn't work on my own. Amazing what can be done with a little Vaseline on a Q-tip rubbed the inside walls of the chamber where the staples ride. All those metal filings and gunk was stopping the spring mechanism from moving freely, and the staple would jam and bend before going through the paper, then the jam would need to be fished out of the end of the stapler with a pair of tweezers. Guess everything needs a little maintenance now and then.

I really had not planned on having a stapler collection...but the Optima looks like a keeper, and it uses the same exact staples as the one bought 7 years ago.",2,6.995065

I use other 0.5mm Pentel pencils, refill them with Pentel 0.5mmm super hi-polymer lead HB, and I have not encountered this problem with any of the other models. This is unacceptable to have a pencil which costs this much and breaks within a month of use. Otherwise, I really liked this pencil.

They are not intuitive or even basically logical.  After I tried Neat 4, I was so disgusted with it, I uninstalled and went back to Neat 3.  Now, I'm trying Neat 5.  Not working.  You can't use the basic search function with a decimal.  Ummmm...Receipts have decimals on them, almost without exception.  But you have to do an advanced search to search for a decimal.  And the search does not recognize any special characters.  Ummmm...why?  How idiotic do you have to be, not to understand that users need to be able to search for ANYTHING - ANYTHING - ANYTHING.  You people at Neat Works just don't think like your customers... at all.  How hard is it to understand that people use your software in a simple, logical way?  You are SO CLOSE to being a wonderful solution...but the ways that you come up short make it worse to use than not to use.  If I can't use Neat 3 on Windows 7, then I am just out of luck.  The latest Neat software is absurdly bad.  If you have more than just a few dozen receipts/documents each month, you may as well keep your filing cabinet.

1946,"Let me start off by saying that I am not an artist! I just love to color... a lot. Have recently received a gorgeous book that got me back into coloring. I watched some online tutorials to try and to the book justice. I initially purchased prismacolors to use. I really liked them however, my daughter also loved them and they were slowly getting lost around the house. Do i need to say how frustrating that was given how expensive they are? I then starting looking for a more reasonably priced option to use. After reading the reviews on these pencils I gave them a shot. Have been using them several months now and am comfortable giving an opinion on them. For the price, they are amazing, let me say that first about them. They blend nicely and I can build several layers up to achieve the desired affect. They are not as creamy or as pigmented as the prismacolors though. I find that to achieve a rich color, I have to press a bit harder than I would like, making building more difficult. As I am usually unwilling to carve out my colors, they are a bit on the light side as a result. I have noticed that out of all of the reds, none of them seem like a true red, they all look either orange or pink when used. The only other complaint I have about them is that I have had an issue with some of the leads breaking. Not all of them, just a handful seem to always break when being sharpened. But other than those few things, I am very happy. I got what I wanted, a cheaper alternative that works well and I won't get mad if my 10 yr old borrows them and they never return. I swatched the colors for you to see them as well as a picture I did using only these color pencils so that you can see what they look like. A little lighter than I would have liked it to turn out, notice on the leaves at the bottom I achieved a better color, but had to press hard to do it and sharpen the pencil every few leaves in the process.

It's been in a box since we got it from Amazon.

Opened it for the first time on 2/23/15 to replace a bad machine.

Removed all the sticky film and plugged it in per the instructions. Got an error 5011 each time I powered it up.

When it powered up I could see the scanner light thing move under the glass, kind of get stuck, flicker for half a second and throw error 5011 on the screen.

Apparently because the scanner didn't work right it wouldn't let the rest of the machine work, either.

The real answer is to open everything and check it as soon as it comes in, EXCEPT that's a bad idea with an inkjet. The in will dry out, nozzles will clog, and it will be a piece of garbage from sitting with ink in it (and the ink will probably be dried out when you need it).

1956,"My experience is nearly identical to Jack Levin's. I bought the phone at a national office supply store for 59.99. Great price, and all the features I wanted--2 lines, caller ID on both lines, lots of memory locations to store numbers, voicemail lights, and a switchable data port, so you can use line 1 or 2 to send and receive faxes. I thought the price for all these features was wonderful.

Caller ID worked fine, that is until I wired my jack for 2 lines. Initially, I had only my ""home office"" number hooked up. I then wired the jack so the second line would be my personal home extension. Once I did this, caller ID broke. It says ""Waiting for caller information"" even after 6 rings. All other phones in the house pick up the caller ID info after 1 ring.

I called support at the number on the bottom of the phone-I was lucky to find it. I didn't find the on the [...]website, nor was it in the manual. Once I called, I was almost sorry I did. I swear I spoke with the dumbest person on the planet-No joke. Even after I explained that I had plugged other phones into each line and the caller ID info is always displayed after 1 ring, she said that my phone company doesn't transmit the ID info until after the 4th ring, and that since my Verizon voicemail service that I subscribe to was picking up after 4 rings, that it would not work. So I called into voicemail and changed it to 6 rings before vm answers. I told her that I wanted to test again, and then she said that the change to my voicemail would take up to 24 hours to process. So I insisted that we test her theory, and it rang 6 times (go figure) and went into voicemail. No caller ID info appeared, as usual. She said that my particular unit must be defective. So I took it back and exchanged it for the same model. Same issue. The phone just doesn't work as designed to handle caller ID when 2 lines are connected.

I did some additional testing to see if using both input jacks instead of just 1 would fix the issue. There are 2 input jacks on the back. The first can be used for line 1 & 2 or just line 1, and the second is just for a single line, line 2. So you have the option of using a 4-wire cable to a jack wired for 2 extensions (using the first input jack only), or plugging into 2 separate wall jacks (using both input jacks). I plugged in a line splitter, which plugs into the wall and provides separate line 1 and line 2 recepticles. When I plug one cord into either singly line, and into the phone (either port on the phone) the caller ID works fine. If I plug 2 cords into the phone, each connected to a separate line, caller ID breaks.

I am returning the phone tomorrow and will purchase the more expensive RCA phone ($85) with basically equivalent features. That phone is model GE-25202RE3. Hopefully I have better luck with that unit.

I loved the phone until I had the second line wired. I would have given it 2 or 3 stars, but the support was so pathetically poor that I must give it the lowest score possible. If zero stars were an option, that would be my rating after my painful support experience.",4,8.815473
1957,"These are the perfect size Post-Its for so many uses!!  One main way I use this is for my shopping list.  I put it in my purse, then when I get to the store, I stick the list on the handle of the shopping cart.

I'm a piano teacher and my students write their own introductions to make a little speech before they play.  I give each student two of these great Post-Its (two in case they mess up the first one, or if they want to write a lot!), and I stick them right on the piano book or sheet music that they're playing from first.  That way there are no falling notecards or slippery pieces of paper for nervous hands to drop.  This way their introduction is stuck right on their music.  The kids even tend to keep their Post-It introductions from recital-to-recital.  I also use the Post-It 1-inch flags to mark the pages that their piano pieces are on.

1958,"As someone who has tried many different types of these organizers, I can say this is my new favorite. First and foremost, it is sturdily constructed and thus, highly durable. Aside from its great looks (The patterned navy poly material is good looking and not cheap looking as many are. You can take it to a meeting and not have it look messy or ugly.), it's practical: The material is waterproof and resists smudging, fingerprints and spills. No, you can't lug it by itself in the rain, because it has slight openings at the top, sides. But for me, who is constantly placing this on table tops when eating and working or at meetings, it's terrific.

As for organizing materials, I really like the stepped and alternating blue/clear dividers. (Small complaint: As others have noted this shipped without the Monthly Tabs and a second white index piece.)

Can it hold 600 sheets of paper? I dunno. At say 50 sheets per divider, it's questionable and if it did, don't know how it would affect overall durability. But myself and most folks I know don't carry around that much paper in these files.

One last small quibble: I prefer the long, wrap as tight or loose as you want thread-style closure on organizers, rather than the looped one on this. The organizer doesn't stay as ""tight"" as I'd like when I am carrying fewer papers. The button part of the closure seems sturdy and isn't likely to fall off as many others have (even when the organizer itself is strong).

The quality is not there. For example the adhesive strips: Johnson & Johnson's Band-aids actually flex around joints whereas the Chinese made adhesive strips do not ( see picture thumb and index fingers Band-aids bend with the joint as they should and you can feel the thought put into it). The Chinese-made adhesive strips do not bend with joint see middle and ring fingers. As long as wound is in a non-joint the adhesive strip may hold, but Band-aids seem to have better glue. The J&J kit was actually cheaper but if I get cut you'll be sure I'll look for the better quality kit. The Chinese FA kit does have instructions in Spanish as well. The J&J kit tells you exactly where things come from and the gauzes are made in China as well as Nitrite gloves. The J&J gauze is 8 layers vs other at 4 thin layers. As much better quality. Again in case of wound I'll go for J&J.
There's no way I could return the 326 product? I haven't tried yet. I would have have to get more things to complete J&Js smaller kit which was purchased at a regular retailer. I'll try to return it but who knows.

How I review:
When I review a product said product automatically starts with four stars as I rarely will purchase anything below four stars.  I then add and/subtract stars based on certain criteria as listed below.
1. If an item is exactly what I expected and nothing more it will receive a four star rating
2. If an item surpasses my expectations it will gain a star
3. If an item goes slightly below my expectations it will lose a star
4. If the instructions for the product (if needed) are poorly written (hard to understand due to language issues or grammar) or just too hard to follow it will lose a star no matter if the product meets or exceed my expectations
5. If a product is significantly below my expectations I will deduct two stars
6. It will be rare that I would give a product one star since I buy mostly items that have a 4+ rating but in rare instances there may be a good reason that even a four star product gets a one star rating from me.  It could be because of customer service issues from the company but whatever the case is I will clearly explain my reason for giving a product only one star",4,7.1264477

1971,"I think the main thing to realize about a ""small-in-one"" printer is that it's a bit more fiddly than you're probably used to with full sized printers. Rather than a single large tray that does everything, there are multiple trays that, well, you have to fiddle with. To load legal paper, you have to take out the CD tray and then extend the main tray, for example (which then juts out from the printer).

That said, it has a much smaller footprint than most other printers (much less all-in-ones) and has a great array of features, plus speedy printing as inkjets go. It can connect to Google Cloud but also can do USB and wireless. I set it up on the wireless network and it works great. I can scan full color documents and print from my desktop across the room. The touch pad screen makes setting it up pretty easy and the directions were reasonable and the included CD will walk you through the setup and getting it connected to the cloud (which is optional).

The other question you may have is ""inkjet vs laser printer"". There's a whole internet of information on that but here's my sum-up:
Get an inkjet if you don't print very often (a few sheets per month, say) and you really want color. Inkjets are cheaper up-front than color laser printers and while the cost per sheet is much higher, you'll never make up the difference unless you print more like 100 sheets per month.

If low volume color printing, scanning and fax is what you're looking for, then you've found it! Compact, low cost for what it does and a good name in printers.",3,7.775618
1972,"I don't like having to read instructions. Well-designed products like printers should be plug and play, and this was Not that. It had me going in circles with network issues, and there was a lot of back-and-forth with the Mac, which led to my grudgingly having to read a manual online. Not a happy camper. Of all the printers I have reviewed the last few years, this one made me jump through the most hoops.

Side note: TEAM LIFT. This thing is HEAVY.

Aside from those complaints, the printout quality is excellent, and for its multifunctionality and the fact it is a color laser printer, the price is quite reasonable. I remember how much something like this would have cost 5 years ago, so it's nice as a small business owner to have home access to something yielding professional results.

It's a pain in the butt at first, but with some patience, it is worth the hassle.",4,5.5259514
1973,"These work great in the bottom drawer so you do not have to bend down so far to read the tags. You can print large enough labels to insert and read them with ease. The larger tab also makes it easy to grab and pull out it stays in place, more surface area i guess.",3,3.2742894
1974,"Worth every penny. Yes, this set is a considerable expense but the quality of these pencils is simply great. I am not a professional artist, not even an experienced hobbyist but even I can tell that these are first class pencils. I am using these just for coloring books but even so the versatility is surprising: Rich color yield when pressing down hard (no splintering or breakage), and subtle shading or lines when applying pressure only delicately. Recommend these without any hesitation - Made in Germany at its finest.",7,6.0849843
1975,"Bought for my daughter, she's ok with it, it felt ok when I sat in it, comfy enough for the price. HOWEVER... the 2nd day she had it, it started squeaking, and it's so annoying and gets louder every day (and yes we tried WD-40 and a couple other things to stop it). Not what I want or expect from a product right out of the box. Nope, I wouldn't buy it again.

**Update 09/28/2017 ~ Down to 1 star - didn't even get a year out of it. Definitely a classic 'got what we paid for' thing, i didn't expect it to last forever but a year would have been nice, and it never did stop the nasty squeak. I sat on it about a month ago and was surprised to feel NO padding, it felt like i was sitting on an old wooden school chair from the 70s :P  Now, a few days ago, the back support failed and the whole back of the chair fell completely backwards to the floor (and took her with it when she leaned back). I could understand if she was rough on her stuff but she's not. I would avoid.",2,4.9314594
1976,"The reason I give this a four star review instead of five is because it is a bit expensive, and upon opening, the smell it has is a bit strong and has taken a few days to fade. Otherwise, it's very nice.",4,3.3673947

1978,"There are many times I don't want to carry my phone and I find jotting down a note with a sketch is much easier to do in a notebook than with any phone app. I have tried a lot of pocket notebooks and these are the ones I now carry daily. They don't have a lot of pages, but that is by design I believe. This way, you move on to the next notebook before the current one gets totally destroyed. The cover has some nice features for recordkeeping like a place to record the date you started using that particular notebook and the date you filled it. There is also a nice little quote """"Inspired by the vanishing subgenre of agricultural memo books, ornate pocket ledgers and the simple, unassuming beauty of a well-crafted grocery list...""",3,9.283842
1979,"The toner cartridges fit however my printer will not recognize them. I get a replace cartridge error every time I try and print.

1980,"Very fast shipping. No box; the envelopes are loose but have small paper bands. Unfortunately I had already trashed the box from my prior envelopes. Great price and fast shipping, but be aware that you may not receive a box. Therefore the picture is not correct. A vendor, CNC, changed their description to a ""wrapped bundle"".",25,5.288688
1981,"I frankly don't know how I lived for almost 65 years without the benefit of this product in my bathroom.  This little dispenser makes it possible for me to mount the little disposable bags where they are handy to me in the bathroom.  I don't have to look all over for the little bag as it is right there in the dispenser.  Try these, you will be hooked.  This is a lady-like way to take care of disposing of your sanitary napkins or your used incontinence pads without the accompanying odor issue.",2,4.219382
1982,"As a elementary Ed. teacher, I have learned that when the pencil sharpener breaks, the class stops functioning. Thank goodness for the X-ACTO replacement kit. It was easy to install and took hardly any time at all. If you've got a screwdriver, this is a much cheaper option to buy a brand-new sharpener. Hopefully I won't have to, but if my blade ever goes out again I will definitely be behind this replacement kit.",2,4.6554785
1983,"These are the best rubber fingertips around, much better than the more common yellow rubber ones that dry up over time.  Get this package of assorted sizes first so you can figure out what size you need.",2,4.1198773

1985,"I use these for both my business and fun. Business, yes, they work perfectly as a hanging file folder should; they are sturdy, hang properly and can manage with a fair amount of overstuffing. I really love the neutral color. They also lend themselves to some great crafting opportunities. I stamped all over a whole box load for a client, and they were so thrilled to have something interesting in their drawers (office drawers that is!) for a change.  I would however recommend the Pendaflex hanging file folders it you need something really durable - they are thicker and better reinforced on the bottom. For the majority of office use, the Smead folders are just fine.",2,4.5041924
1986,for the amount of black and cyan/mag/yellow you cannot beat the price! I will be ordering as long as this product is made available.  - happy customer,2,4.56895
1987,"Got this in the mail yesterday and was very happy. When I ordered last week ... there was no sourcing fee. For 1.50 it's a very unique/compact/easy-to-carry notebook. It's thin enough to fit inside a purse and can be used to jot down ""to do"" lists or whatnot but it's too small for journaling. I've ordered several more notebooks from the publisher and can't wait for them to come! Wish Amazon would carry more of these notebooks because there are some stunning ones featuring the paintings of Renoir/Degas/John Singer Sargent. All for 1.50 or less. These make excellent stocking stuffers and I cant imagine a ""girly girl"" or sensitive guy would be disappointed to receive one. Im happy with the quality and will buy the William Morris address book ... if there's no sourcing fee.",8,5.807779
1988,"Not sure what to write, other than this is in fact a high quality journal. The cover and pages are of quality materials, the printing is quality, and the pics and wording are as shown in the pictures. It's a good product.",7,6.281883

1990,"I had a heck of a time trying to get this running.  The short story is go to the Visioneer web site to download the latest tools and utilities.  I have it running fine on a Windows 7 notebook.

I have a standard flatbed scanner for photos that is my primary use, but for quick scans of bills, receipts etc., it's a great addition.  I save everything to PDF and can shred most paper keeping the documents as files backed up on disc.  For tax purposes, it's ideal.  You have everything searchable and no digging through papers and file drawers.  I am not almost completely paperless and this is the way to go.

The quality is pretty good, and everything textual is crisp and printable.  Obviously not intended for photos or artistic use, even though it is a color scanner. I prefer my standard flatbed. This is merely a companion to my paper shredder.

The current (MSRP) list price is too high, but the sale price is currently 64% off. That's about right.",10,7.0844026
1991,"I have never been more furious with a piece of technology!
Ink use is about 50 pages max and the printer will not allow you to use it when it is low.
For ink that doesn't last hardly it's bitter to pay 20-30 for 30-50 pages of prints! (And I'm not talking about specialty prints but BASIC printing needs.) Have to replace the maintenance box multiple times within a year. Even happy users will tell you this. To me it isn't worth the hassle at all.
This printer basically cost what about 5 full function canons would cost maintenance alone!! It's ridiculous.
I hate that I ever owned this horrible printer!!",13,6.0743537
1992,"These do exactly what they claim.  We laminate a lot in our homeschool classroom & I love how durable the pages turn out.  We use them with dry erase markers, as game pieces (complete with Velcro on the backs), & I've not had one piece come apart. When I worked in the business world, I used other lamination products & they did not hold up nearly as well.  I can even spray pieces that have been cut ((lightly)) with water to erase marker & haven't had a problem.  Definitely worth the money!",3,6.926304
1993,"This prints photos quickly and in better quality than some 1 hour photo places. I use a collage app on my phone to print more than one photo on a page. I use this for my scrapbook/journal. I have tried other compact photo printers and this one is my favorite now. I did not get the battery, I just use the power cord and its super easy. I ordered the Canon KP-108IN paper and ink set to go with this.",13,7.563424
1994,"I use these in my classroom and at home. The chisel tip allows me to use a wider line for letters thereby helping my struggling readers or, those with Dyslexia/Dysgraphia. I am Dyslexia certified but, strategies such as using lots of color when writing works for ALL students, not just those with reading issues. So, if I am teaching the vowel team, I will code the letters using a different color. Digraphs (ch, wh, th, qu, etc.)  get a box around them to make a physical reminder for the children that these are 2 letters together which make one NEW sound. Again, I use a different color to demonstrate this so the rule will ""POP"" when the children see it. The students then begin to code their own words and soar as they learn. What on EARTH did we do before dry erase?!?

Many have written that these markers do NOT come out of clothing or furniture. In fact, they will. Use alcohol and rub it into the places where the marker spot is. This works on clothing and on couches. Our daughter ALSO has Dyslexia and does better with her spelling and coding of her words on the couch. This is how we remove any marks that inadvertently made their way to the couch. Simply apply a bit of alcohol to the place where the marker spot is, wipe with a rag and buff with a cotton ball. The color comes out. I have done the same with clothing as well.

I bought these on Amazon as they are cheaper here than in a store. Further, we use dry erase every single day at home and at school. This is a great buy. Mine also didn't come with yellow but that is OK- yellow isn't a color I use for teaching anyway as it is both hard to see and is not good for those with reading issues- blues, purples, greens- those are better with lighter tones for coding. I bought a yellow at the dollar store but for me. I like the fact that there are so many colors to choose from which ""grabs"" the attention of my students when we learn a new spelling pattern.

As well, someone mentioned the low odor- I must agree. Some dry erase brands have such a strong odor they are really not safe for young children to use. If I am bothered by the odor, it is likely they are too. Expo is my favorite brand as they last longer, the low-odor factor, the color variety which is so important to me as I work with many who have Dyslexia and must use color, and finally, here on Amazon, these markers are a good buy.",2,14.225345
1995,These are nice colored pencils.  Keep in mind that I am just using them in a coloring book and have little artistic skill or know-how. The triangular shape is nice to hold. They are easy to sharpen and I haven't had a lead break or fall out on me yet.,3,4.4462676
1996,"Really great product!  It took me about 6 hours to configure it (but I have never done anything like this in my life).
I was able to connect it to my Vonage SIP as well as a Magic Jack device.",2,3.1232548
1997,"We have an address book that came with a Staedtler Lumocolor Pen and it finally went dry. The pens work so well in this address book in that if someone's address changes, one can erase the address with rubbing alcohol on a tissue and write in the new address. 4 of these pens will last us until I am 109 years old, so I will write back then with further comment.",4,7.110034
1998,"This seems like a nice portfolio. I just got it, so I can't say how long it will hold up. I won't be using it every day. In fact, rarely, but I needed something to organize important papers that I have to take with me on location. I don't like the waste of space on the left side with all of the credit card holders. What is the purpose of that? I would never insert credit cards or any other important identification/cards in those, especially that many. Something else should have been integrated there.

Still this was the best value that I came across online after doing a lot of research. If it's in your price range, I recommend it (especially if you have a lot of credit cards and IDs!).",2,4.418498
1999,"This is a hefty, large pen which writes really easily and well.  And it is beautiful!

I get a lot compliments on this pen.  The sea shell is bright and colorful, and reflects light really beautifully.

The nib writes very smoothly.  It puts down a generous but not too-heavy flow of ink.  I like how easily this pen writes.

The pen comes with an ink converter.  But be aware that it does not come with any ink or cartridges.",2,6.690352
2000,"Bleu Nuit is a good ink, but not great.  It's a pretty enough blue and works very well in the couple pens I've used so far.  Flows well and has near perfect lubrication like most J. Herbin inks.  It doesn't completely wash off the page with water, but I wouldn't trust this ink to stick around on paper if you mess with it too much.  It doesn't stink, as many inks do.

The great thing about this ink is the fact it changes color as you write.  It starts out a bright purple and then dries to a muted blue, just like the front little picture shows.  That is also why it loses 1 star - most J. Herbin inks always seem to be faded/chalky looking.  I find this especially odd as the inks are nearly as permanent as other companies have made and the chalky look is typical to the permanence.  Who knows, I forgive the J. Herbin inks overall though because they are very affordable and every other property of the ink is above par.",4,8.353728

For the money I would look no further than these Uniball Signo 207 retractable pens. First the obvious, being retractable no need to keep track of caps.

Anyway, after about a day we received our first phone call and the caller couldn't hear us, tried the next phone - same thing. I reseated all the batteries, played with settings and still, none of the phones would carry voice over to the caller, it acted as if it was on mute the whole time.

As a tech savy person, I have no clue how this could happen across all devices, only thing I could come up with is it's probably a programming or hardware issue.

2021,"As far as I am concerned, organization is the key to a good life and this little plastic contraption helped me in that department. Instead of using the stand for a computer monitor or laptop as the product is intended to use, I spruced up the kitchen work area and now have a much safer home for my iPad, two cell phones and landline phone. How cool is that? (You can see the result in the attached photos.)

In addition, I adjusted the height of the stand, which is a bonus feature, and that helped me eliminate the eyesore of cords by conveniently hiding them on the bottom in the back of the stand. Personally for me, the black color complemented the work area that I revamped.

The stand, thus far, seems sturdy enough; historically, I believe the 3M brand is recognized for its solid products. The only drawback is price. The stand, in my opinion, is expensive but consumers should be happy to open their wallets wide and support a great company that keeps the American worker working! Thank you 3M!

The tray is well built with a metal frame/support and plastic tray. I have had both CRT's and flat pannel monitors on them with NO ISSUES!!!!

It has plenty of room for the biggest of keyboards as well as 2 spaces in the front for a pen or Sharpie and another for screws, change or whatever!!

These also help get your monitor to the right level for viewing.

These trays do exactly what they are ment to do and they do it well, I have been using 1 of the 2 for several years, having just bought the second for a computer/keyboard that I have on a desk to the side of me. I liked the first so much that I bought another........ that should say it all!!!!

It is about 4-3/4"" wide so I can only hold it on its side, not fully grasp it.  It is, however, a very attractive calculator with an elegant silver case.  Very attractive for a woman's use, or handsome for a man's use.  The keys are very soft and responsive.  The readout is very large and easy to read.

I keep a handwritten work log on my desk, I work in IT and I need to keep track of what I do and how long it takes.  This becomes a permanent archive of not only my time but how I solved a problem and I need to be able to reference how a problem was solved because it can be years between when a certain problem crops up the first time and the next time I see that problem again.  There are programs for computers for this and I've tried a lot of them and don't like any of them.  Being as I'm a fountain pen fan anyway I went back to handwriting my log.  I experimented with many different formats; binders, portfolios, padfolios, wire tablets and bound notebook configurations.  What works the best for me is a leather three ring binder with high quality reinforced paper.

So I set out to find the best paper I could put in that 3 ring binder.  This is important with a fountain pen because cheap, thin paper allows the ink to bleed through and completely penetrate the paper.  This makes it necessary to have a blotter page under the sheet being used and it makes it impossible to use both sides of a sheet.  This doubles the cost of paper because I can only use one side.  It also doubles the bulk of stored paper that has been written on.  The finish is important because it affects how the pen and paper interact which in turn affects the quality of the script and penmanship.  I usually use papers like Rhodia and Clairfontaine but I couldn't find any of that kind of paper in a 3 ring binder configuration.

This is most important to users of fountain pens and much less so to users of ballpoints and gel pens.  It is much less important if you're jotting notes in a class to review later and eventually discard.  If you're using a fountain pen and need to archive what you write then the grade and characteristics of the paper (and ink, but that's for another review) become very important.

This may not apply to your situation so if it doesn't this paper will probably work fine for you.  If you're a fountain pen user then you know exactly what I'm talking about and why I'm talking about it.  If you're not then the things I'm saying about this paper are going to seem trivial but it is NOT to a fountain pen user.

Mead Five Star works OK for me, all but the most penetrating counter-forgery inks lay on the sheet without going clear through it.  The finish and texture of the paper is acceptable but it's not the best I've found.  The ruled lines are very faint to almost non-existent and they are not consistent across an entire sheet.  It works but it doesn't work the best, if this is all I could get I'd buy it and live with it.

I've haunted a lot of stationary stores and shops looking for this ""Holy Grail"" of paper that will fit my purposes well.  I've browsed even more online paper and stationary sites looking for it too.  Where I found it is a little surprising ...

Target has this same Mead Five Star Reinforced Paper for around $3.50.  Target also has a store brand called Up & Up Heavyweight College Ruled Reinforced Paper in 125 sheet packs for $2.50.  The Target brand paper is superior paper by a very noticeable degree.  The Target paper is smoother, a fountain pen glides across it like Rhodia paper - so the finish is better.  It's heavier paper.  The blue lines are even, consistent and easily visible without being obtrusive.  Even Noodlers Bad Green Gator Bullet Proof Ink doesn't soak through the Target paper and that ink goes through almost every paper I've tried except Rhodia (which has a wax component that prevents that) and some Clairfontaine notebooks.  The Target paper can be written on both sides.

The one thing I don't like about the Target Up & Up paper is that the reinforcing strip of plastic is much wider than this Mead Five Star.  I like to use both margins on both sides - the left for time and date and the right for a short notation about the log entry.  I can't do that with the Target paper because the plastic strip is too wide.  All else considered I can live with that until I find something better.  I can live with it because it's better paper simply as paper goes.  The fact that it's cheaper is a plus but I'd pay more for a good paper.

I don't NEED that kind of paper for everything so I don't use it except in the log book I mentioned, but that is ALL I'll use in that log book until something else turns up.

So this is a very specific application for a paper and it probably doesn't apply to everyone.  If it does apply to you then save yourself some frustration and some money and buy that Target paper instead.  Mead is a huge paper company and they need to lift their game a bit if they want to compete with the paper I can get more of and cheaper at Target.

With the difference in cost and sheets per pack of paper the Mead Five Star comes out to being about 40% more costly for a lower grade of paper and that's why I wrote this review.",13,11.526092
2034,"After a very long search for a 2-line phone, I decided to buy this one. Panasonic no longer makes good phones (sticky keys and key labels that disappear after some use), so this was one of the two choices left.

PROS:
- The phone has good sound quality. It seems to be well built and all keys can be pressed with minimum effort and they move freely up and down as expected.
- The screen is very well lit.
- My cellphone connects very easily and consistently with the phone and I can answer it from the main unit without any issues. Dialing from the handsets using the cell phone is also very nicely implemented and works like a charm.
- There are multiple directory options that may be useful to some (you can download all your cell phone's directory to the base unit and handsets).

CONS:
- The multiple directories can be a pain. Even with no other directory loaded, to get to the name you want to dial takes the following keystrokes: DIR -> SELECT -> First letter of the name -> WAIT for 4 seconds for it to search -> scroll up/down on the catalog to find the name you need -> LINE button. It takes very long to get to the name you need. The pause is so that you can enter up to 3 letters, but that's for people with 1,000 names in the directory.
- To get your messages remotely, you have to dial EACH LINE INDEPENDENTLY. I called AT&T and confirmed that there is no way to get all your messages with one call. Someone was sleeping during the design of this feature. To find out if I have any calls, I have to dial each number separately! That is plain silly.
- When the headsets charge on the base, a nice blue LED ring around the center round button is lit to acknowledge that it is charging. This is a nice feature, but it does not work if you have a phone on your nightstand. The whole bedroom is lit in a blue hue all night long. Another AT&T mistake. I am planning on disconnecting the LED by opening the handset. Or plan on not having a phone in your bedroom.
- The ring tones are from the 90s. They are just an annoying sound. In this day and age you would expect something much, much better than this. My 10 year old Panasonic would allow me to load my own ring tones.

6 MONTS LATER:
MORE CONS (and only CONS):
- This phone is impossible! 6 months into it, every time I call to get my messages, it gets stuck. It no longer answers calls until I reset it by pulling the plug. Try doing that when you are on vacation!
- The speed dial is impossible. You can search for a name by pressing a number (letter). All other phones would jump to that letter in your phone directory. This one waits to see if you are going to press it again, hence selecting another letter, then jumps. Basically finding a name that way is excruciatingly slow. Forget it!",4,13.9850025
2035,"I've been using this brand of journals since 1999. The design works great for me. The daily prompts help to keep the pen flowing.

2036,"In December 2009, Samuel Johnson reviewed these Pentel Client pens, comparing them to the originals that he purchased in 2004.  He was very disappointed with the newer version.  I too purchased the Pentel Client in the summer of 2004, and after reading Mr. Johnson's comments I ordered the 3 pack from Amazon, with reservations.  Mr. Johnson is right, the newer pens don't write as well as the originals and the weight is different.  If you never used that original pen, you don't know what you're missing.  I probably paid about three dollars for the original Pentel Client at Staples, but the pen felt and wrote like an old Parker pen that I once owned.  The weight was perfect and it wrote smoothly and boldly.  What's more surprising, probably because I don't write much, is that it still has the original refill that it came with.  I used it to draw an eight by ten picture of an otter a few weeks ago, which involved numerous lines of ink because an otter has plenty of dark fur, and the pen still writes.

So, back to the newer Pentel version.  It's May 2012, almost three years after Mr. Johnson posted his review.  The pens I received are mostly metal, but not the same type of metal.  The old metal has a coppery appearance along the inner treads of the upper barrel and a steel-like look on the lower barrel's treads. On the new model, the upper barrel is metal and the treads perhaps zinc. The lower barrel, which is about half the size of the upper barrel, thereby representing about 1/3 of the pen's body is plastic until it reaches the tip, which is metal.  If I hold each pen, old and new, by the clicker, between my middle and index finger, the older model hangs lower because of its fuller weight.  They each contain a similar looking metal cartridge, but the older model had a wider, smoother tip.  The newer model produces a thinner line with a scratchy-feeling motion.  So, because of the inferior writing quality, I agree with Mr. Johnson, but the Pentel Client still has a nice look.  If you're not looking for appearance, you'll probably do better with the inexpensive Bic Atlantis or other plastic click pen.  I'm still looking for a smooth writing pen that produces bold lines.  If anyone out there knows if the Parker Sonnet or other well known brand of ball point or roller ball pen clicks instead of twists, please leave a comment.",11,14.632478
2037,"These pens are OK to me, but I doubt if I will rebuy them.  They do write smoothly, which is important to me.  But the colored inks bleed, so writing on the outside of envelopes is out, in case of rain or snow when the mail carrier delivers the mail.  That is the main thing I do not like about these pens.  I also prefer a finer fine point than these are, and I purchased the finest fine point I found in these pens.

But when I bought my first Lamy from 'Laywine's' in Toronto that was it, I found a fountain pen that looked good, worked well in two ways, and was certainly priced right--except for a Cross I received as a gift, I have never used another fountain pen since I was introduced to Lamy.

The way I see life, only entities like Michelangelo's 'Sistine Chapel', Shakespeare's 'Hamlet', or God's 'Grand Canyon' deserve ***** so I give the Lamy 4 stars, but it is definitely the best fountain pen on earth for its quality and price.",25,5.746919
2042,"I purchased this Fellowes 79Ci to replace a very LOUD and much cheaper cross-shredder. I wanted to use it for a while before writing this review. It has been three months and I have to give this product 5 Stars. Like most of you, I wondered for some time whether I wanted to spend this much on a shredder. I know I hated the slow grinding of my previous shredder that died ingesting a credit card. And it was LOUD I say.

I am so glad I went with the Fellowes 79Ci. I didn't know shredders could be this quiet. You can easily stand next to this unit and have a conversation while it is running. Also, it seems that manufacturers overstate the page capacity of these shredders. I will give Fellowes an A- for their 14 sheet rating. I just tested that claim with standard printer paper and it refused 14 pages. However, it did take 13 pages, albeit with at the RED bar rating. One of my goals was to be able to drop junk mail into the shredder without having to open it. I find that I can do that about 75% of the time without the Fellowes balking.

Works well with alcohol markers like Spectrum Noir / Copic markers as well as sponging color onto the paper.  I have not tried using the re-inkers or water color pencils/pens directly onto this paper yet.  My Cannon laser printer does not like this thickness, but will take the 60 lb in the same family.

2047,"I have owned scanners since the days of $800 300dpi SCSI scanners that were the size of a stack of pizza boxes. The P-215 is a small, compact gadget that scans color duplex at high quality.

The scanner is amazingly small for what it does.
It sort of resembles a hardcover book - though not as wide.  It is transformer like, the way it unfolds and opens up into a paper feeding machine.  Amazingly, for a scanner so small, it scans duplex.  To make the total package size even more compact and convenient, it does not come with a power adapter, but rather two USB cords to plug into a computer.  It draws all of its power from USB.

While the hardware is top notch, the software is very good, but has a few rough edges.  There are two main scanning modes, that corresponds to a switch in the back confusingly named AutoStart On/Off. Canon must have received lots of feedback on this issue, as they now include a note taped to the scanner altering the user to this issue.

Getting started is easy - In AutoStart mode, no software is installed on the computer.  This allows the scanner to be used with virtually any machine, Mac or PC.  AutoStart mode ""off"" requires to the use to install software from a disk. The Mac version installed without a hitch on my computer.  The software provides a wider number of scanning and saving formats.

In the fully automatic mode, the scanner is one touch and creates a black and white or color scanner depending on the image being scanned.  It can straighten crooked scans and even skip blank pages.  When you perform a scan it even automatically OCRs the document - which means you can search by text.

Overall it is an excellent little scanner.

Another small issue is the requirement that the scanner be plugged directly into the computer, and not through a hub.  If you are like me, you'll have to unplug something else to make room for the scanner.  Only the data USB needs to be plugged into the computer, and the 2nd power cable can be plugged into a powered USB hub.

If you're looking to do some document scanning, I can highly recommend this versatile little scanner.",8,9.931407

2050,"To avoid any confusion, as another reviewer pointed out there seems to be some sort of a mix of different types of business cards and reviews.  This review is for Avery Glossy Ink Jet Print to the Edge business cards 8373 template, 200 count.

I purchased these glossy cards because I started my own automotive detailing business and I am very specific about wanting a glossy business card due to the industry I am in.  I might just be crazy but I feel it's nice to pass out a high gloss business card that could leave the impression that that's just what we do/who we are ""return the gloss to your auto finish"". Anyway, let me help you to have a better understanding of these cards.

Quality:  4 stars out of 5.  I feel that much like any other print at home business card i've used that these could be just a little bit thicker/sturdier.  However, the high quality vivid images that these cards allow for to be produced does well more than compensate for the thickness.  They were no thinner than the 8869 Print to the edge clean edge avery business cards that I had used prior to these so I am sure it is just the industry standard.  Imagine printing a photo on plain paper, what happens?  The ink ""bleeds"" into the paper and literally dye's/fades into it.  Now, print the same image on high quality photo paper and the end result is much more vivid, vibrant, and professional looking.  These cards produce that effect.

Some tips... You CAN do double sided printing with these cards HOWEVER, only one side is glossy.  So make sure you put your main business features on the glossy side, and maybe just a simple business name on the other, if you are doing double sided printing. Additionally, I HIGHLY recommend these glossy business cards if you are doing a variety of colors on your card and especially if you are doing a background color.  My background color was black, they turned out literally 3 times as nice as they other cards that i used prior to this simply because as I mentioned the colors didn't bleed into the paper and blend together.  Avery was nice to provide a ""practice"" sheet to you to make sure you know which way to feed the paper into your printer.  Finally, be sure to set your printer settings to glossy paper and high quality to obtain the best prints.  I made the mistake of getting a little giddy with these when I first got them and printed them standard quality/standard paper and the ink smudged rendering one page of cards useless.

Love these and highly recommend them to add a new level of professionalism to your business.  Hope this helped!",26,9.614082

It seemed to work okay with my windows laptop, if you want it for windows, it will probably do okay, but as a printer for use with Samsung Galaxy Wifi Tablets, it was very frustrating to try to get it to print or maintain availability for printing - combine that with Androids failure to provide a consistent printer installation interface between versions and it was more trouble than it was worth - in a lot of ways, android is kind of cripple-ware",4,8.006299

Not only that, but the second bookmark ribbon is this unappealing gray and black striped one. It bothered me enough that I used a pair of scissors and cut the extra ribbon off, leaving the plain black one.

2069,"Just bought this at Staples (sorry Amazon but you were asking $149 for this about 4 days ago, and I bought it for $99).  This replaced my Lexmark Pro 205 which I had to toss.  I had gotten a paper jam and there was a tiny piece of paper that I could not get out and it messed up the printing.  Lexmark had no interest so it is now in the recycle bin.  I love this printer.  It is very sleek looking and is not too loud.  It actually scans faster than the Lexmark did.  I decided not to bother getting the automatic feeder for scanning or copying since they don't seem to work.  Half the time, it skips at least one sheet and it is always in the middle of the pack. I printed about 10 photos with some Canon Glossy 4x6 paper and they turn out beautiful.  Text also prints nice and sharp.  The best thing is this DOES NOT EAT INK like the Lexmark did.  Considering how tiny the cartridges are, I thought I'd be changing the cartridge after a few days but I have printed many documents and the ink indicator says I still have most of the ink available (and those are the original cartridges).  It  prints the first page first, instead of the last page first like the Lexmark did (no biggie) and the output tray automatically opens when you tell it to print so if you forget to open it, it won't crumple your document or copy.  When you turn it off, no dust bunnies can get in!  Give this one a try!  P.S. It's wireless also.  You can also use generic ink which I have not tried yet (Amazon sells some).

1/2/13:  UPDATE:  I have now used most of the features of this printer.  I have never had a jam and I print out a lot of greeting cards using 24 lb heavy matte paper stock.  I just tell the printer to take the paper from the rear tray and it never gets stuck.  Ink dries very fast and I have never smeared anything. I discovered you can also have a long document print from the last page instead of the first page so they are all in order when finished - a time saver!  I print mostly black text documents so I have kept a log of how much ink I am using.  There are two black ink cartridges, one is much bigger than the other one.  I find the big one I go through faster, about once a month and after doing a big search of prices on the internet have found that Amazon has the lowest prices.  The ink is very good, dries quickly, and the only color that is a bit off, is the cyan (blue/green) and that could be the printer and not the ink.  I find that turquoise colors tend to print as royal blue or a little too blue instead of green.  Green tends to print a bit too light.  Might be a problem for some people but it's ok with me.  Photo printing is pretty fast and ink dries very fast.  Scanning is not as easy as I'd like.  To scan multiple documents, you have to go into the Navigation icon and click on 'Multiple documents' or it won't scan additional documents.  Other printers make it a little easier.  There is also a 'quiet mode' for people who don't like lound sounds.  The only thing I find annoying is every time it finishes printing something, it does a 'self-cleaning cycle thing' and you can't stop it.  The only way to beat it is to print something very fast before it does it's thing again.  Other than that, I am very happy with this printer and will buy another when the time comes.",3,14.21708

The 1"" round ring inside is also well-made - there ARE inner pockets, so you can put extra loose notes in the front and back inside of the binder: great EXTRA feature!  The paper size is a bit odd of course, being a small-size binder, but once you get some great paper and tabs that fit inside, this product is very effective in on-the-go note-taking, to do lists, calendar appointments, writing, etc.  I would highly recommend this product, especially to those like myself: the female business-woman on-the-go!",2,8.747085

2073,"I was in the market for a new, wireless color printer with a scanner, so I couldn't resist the Epson WF-7510. Here are my thoughts:

- This printer is HUGE. Now, that's not a bad thing at all. But if you're planning on hiding this printer in some cabinet or on a small printer cart, you may want to rethink things. If you think about it, the printer can print up to 13"" x 9"" and scan up to 11"" x 17"", so of course it's going to be bigger than your standard printer.

- We have this printer on a good-sized table, and I was thrilled to see it doesn't violently shake while printing! This has been a problem with previous printers.

- You can purchase the ink cartridges individually, by color, which is always convenient - it means you don't have to throw away perfectly good ink cartridges when only one color is depleted.

- The color print quality is VERY good and it is fast. I was surprised at how quickly (and quietly!) it printed - I could easily use this printer to print good quality color photos.

- The wireless setup is an absolute breeze (though you do have to install software on every computer you want to use it from), and I love that I can use the free Epson app to print from my iPad/iPhone.

- I don't fax, so can't speak to that function, but it seems to be simple to fax a document from your computer wirelessly, judging from the program installed on my computer.

- I love the 200-sheet paper capacity!

All in all, if you're looking for a color wireless printer/scanner, as long as you don't mind the size of this one, I can't recommend it highly enough.",2,8.733308

2076,"I've been using this printer for a couple months now to print Amazon shipping AND FBA labels. There's a trick to doing this to make it a bit easier - search for ""Amazon Label Printer"" and go to ""Digvijay's Digital Store"", There are two programs, one to print FBA labels and one for the shipping labels. Both take the Amazon product and package pdf files and automatically crop and rotate them so the 4xl can easily print them. They are a little pricey, but worth it if you don't want to pay a monthly subscription fee.

Conclusion:
 - You can use this printer for FBA labels & shipping labels with the help of two programs
 - Have to use labels with hole on the left side - doesn't have to be dymo brand, but this is what they recommend to make money on labels
 - Works with ebay, etsy, and Paypal's shipping tool
 - Does not work with UPS or USPS without other software",6,5.2333465

This changes during a small print job, a large print job, anytime the printer feels like it.

2084,"First impressions:
Solid Build, Sleek Looking - Doesn't feel cheap, Bigger than I'm used too - comes in a HUGE box, can solo carry even though box says two person carry, well packaged and shipped in perfect condition- Apparently the newest model of this type of printer (after doing some research between this and the older model I bit the bullet on this one as I wanted to be able to print from my phone and the added wireless printing sounded nice.

The Pros: Wireless feature works excellent ( coming out of standby automatically ) - stays connected to my wifi even after being powered off and on- I tested both wired and wireless and both are A-OK!

As another poster mentioned this can print on out of spec paper (I bought this to print birth announcement cards and on envelopes and let me say it did NOT disappoint - now did it curl the paper. I printed about 100 full color copies with a bleed on 8.5 x 11 card stock ( 90lb ) - and they turned out EXCELLENT!!! - The duplex feature also worked AMAZINGLY! saved me sooooo much time and the back and front lined up purrrrfectly. I was able to print out all the envelopes and cards in about 20 minutes.

The print quality itself is MUCH better than my samsung CLP-325W (colors are richer / darker / crisper / any other adjectives you can think of ) -- I bought some high gloss paper as well and this REALLY makes pictures pop.

It isn't that loud. (but loudness is subjective)

I love the front feed tray (allowing you to do envelopes and other smaller or custom pages easily) Beats having to load the bottom tray with these items.

Tidbits -- it uses ~900 Watts per second at startup and when warming up and uses ~950 Wps when the rollers and spinning the toners- When it is calm and sitting at the ready light / standby mode it uses ~6-9 WPS, so if you are going to leave this on all day all year you are looking at a measly amount of electricity drain.

The Cons: Toner refills appear to be pretty pricey ( but the carts are huge so I expect them to last awhile and I plan on usnig a refill kit so that should save on refil cost.

The drivers/software that comes with it don't appear to have a standard pre-programmed print size for A7 (5x7 envelopes) which is a pretty standard size but also I don't see this as a Con because you can select a custom paper size and it works perfectly, just punch in 5.25 x 7.25 and you're golden!

Worth the Money / Would I buy this item again?: Absolutely! I've run a few print tests side by side with my Samsung CLP-325W and it really kicks booty.",33,8.397052

Good quality. Not necessarily as pictured.
Functionally I would give these 5 stars for their size and quality of sharpening. I LOVE the size. I dropped it to 4 because of inaccuracy of the listing. First of all The product itself is structurally identical, but the finish is COMPLETELY different (see picture). Translucent covers in bright pastel pink, blue, and green. I guess it depends on what you want them for. I am selling them to middle schoolers so they probably will like them more. Oh, BTW as you can see they are individually packaged for hanging with Chinese text. I ordered these before from another seller (always seems to be only one seller offering these). They were exactly as pictured in the listing. So if it matters to you what they look like you might try contacting the seller before you buy.  Order ahead of your anticipated need.

2091,"Time to tell this story once more.
This printer was my fourth Dell, purchased in 2009. The reasons I bought it were rather stupid, I admit: I kept giving Dell a chance to redeem themselves from the fiasco of the previous three, as a serious corportation they appear to be (as if corporation like this care about redemption!)  This one looked good, and at the price, better.  But (lo and behold) 14 months later (and, well... sure, out of warranty) it refused to print anymore and got stuck with the message ""The is something wrong with the printhead"". And so it was: I could not print, I could not scan, I could not anything. The printer was, again, STUCK.  But the worse is when I contacted Dell and tried buying a new printhead (basically, a cartridge containing the ink nods). I spent HOURS trying to get a knowlegable person online and, for what... to learn that ""they don't sell PRINTHEADS separately"". Would you believe this!? That means I have to replace THE WHOLE MACHINE??? (I asked) If the Dell rep. appeared dumb is merely because his/her company does not give a hoot and thinks that it is sufficient to have ""a name"" and rest on the laurels of failure, who cares? ""We'll keep makin' money anyway"".
[These top managers have not taken Marketing 1010, it seems].
End of story: I had to buy ANOTHER printer. This time an HP which is working fantastic and gives me good support, even out of warranty.
And lastly: you might know that it is not easy to buy Dell ink; o yes, they are that arrogant. You have to go online or go to Staples. Ah! but did you know that if one of the ink cartridges goes empty you cannot print further? Oh yea, the printer stops until you replace the empty one!
Now, if that is not a bully corporation, I don't know what is. I will NEVER buy anything from Dell anymore. For me the brand represents CHEATING. And I hope others follow suit so the coroportation goes wherever it deserves to land.

2098,"This opinion is about Doxie Go Plus (DX220) - I have recently come to acquire a bulk of approx. 5,000 photos that needed scanning at an archival 600dpi. Having much experience with scanning on flat bed scanner I thought of getting Doxie to do 99% percent of the job for me (feeding, scanning, croping, saving) leaving 1% to me (renaming and filing in proper folder).

Before fully-committing to this device I ran some comparison tests with a flat bed scanner to see whether Doxie was in fact the quality of scan I needed. The results came out disappointing --- I scanned two photos at optical 600dpi resolution. One photo with high contrast brights and one with dark shades to see how Doxie handles range of contrast, gamma and saturation.

The flat-bed scanner delivered full array of shades between whites and blacks, natural saturation and contrast. I proved more prone to dust specks that got in between photo-glass.

Doxie (Go Plus DX220) delievered highly-compressed (artifacts at crucial areas of the photos, like sharp lines, shiny reflections, jewelry), over-contrast balance and over-saturated colors. It did provide a dust-free scan but half-kilobyte size of the file produced by flat-bed method.

In my opinion Doxie is a wonderful scanner for document scanning (as the name on packaging suggests) - perfect for scanning forms, legal documents and newspaper articles - but I would not use this device for scanning photos, especially archival images used for enlarging, retouching and/or reprinting.

Back story:  I worked all summer in my school library (where I am librarian), trying to finish automating our collection (putting information about each book, DVD, etc. into a database), making that information accessible for keeping records of patron check-outs (borrowing books) and other such record-keeping information.

Every time I made a mistake I had to use wite-out Papermate's<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stock-Color-All-Purpose-Correction-Fluid-22-ml-Bottle-Green-PAP57101-Category-Correction-Fluids-and-Pens/dp/B001E65MG6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stock Color All Purpose Correction Fluid, 22 ml Bottle, Green (PAP57101) Category: Correction Fluids and Pens</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BIC-Wite-Out-Super-Smooth-Correction-Fluid-0-7-oz-Bottle-White-12-per-Pack-WOFSM12WE/dp/B001CDB9OU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BIC Wite-Out Super Smooth Correction Fluid, 0.7 oz. Bottle, White , 12 per Pack (WOFSM12WE)</a>. I'm sure you know the problem with liquid wite-out--you must wait a good while for the white to dry or else your ink will smear.

The Bic Wite-Out Correction Tape is perfect! There is no drying time. It rolls on perfectly in one quick stroke. Or, you can roll slowly. Fast or slow, the white goes on and stays on and completely hides the error. I totally love this product. A picky but interesting minor reason to like it is its vivid case colors: that deep blue, an emerald green, a vibrant orange.

I first tried the two-pak because my great-niece was working with me. Although she was only eleven at the time, she is a good worker and is a whiz at computers. I had a tape and she had one. However, she and the wite-out-on-tape did not get along. In fact, in no time she broke her tape and I had to discard the product.

I had carefully shown her how to use it. See that circle on the product? You place your thumb in it to get a correct hold, then press the whole dispenser flat against the error and roll. It's really very easy. After she broke a second one, she lost that job and started another task. But I have no problem in holding the dispenser.

You all told me when it would arrive,and also let me know when it was sent out. It arrived in good working order,and I put it in my typewriter. It does work and I can't wait to use my typewriter for writing out different forms. My son says he would love too use it to.

The eraser is okay but the chalk is way too hard. I don't know if it would work better on a regular chalkboard/blackboard. But for us, it's too hard to draw/write with. It barely makes a mark unless putting a lot of pressure, but then it just leaves a deep scratch behind. Also, the colors don't show well. It all just looks white on the chalkboard. Maybe it's just not made for chalkpaint chalkboards. Whatever the case, it didn't work for our needs.",8,6.622775

Ms Stocks passed away a little over a year ago at the age of 72, and the final page of the 2013 calendar pays tribute to her. I am sure that her estate will keep on producing more calendars and planners, such as this lovely 2013 edition. As usual, each month has an appropriate country or village scene depicting activities from the 19th century. The village scene on the front of the calender is for the month of December, and shows Ms Stocks usual attention to detail. People are shopping, riding in sleighs down snowy streets and up hill sides, the homes and stores are inviting, and a lovely Christmas tree sits in the village square. It is the idealized rural village that continues to have a grasp on the imagination of so many of us, especially when you from time to time find yourself longing for a slower pace of life, even on just a temporary basis. The calendar can bring that to you! I have purchased Ms Nelson's calendars for years, and am never disappointed. I always look forward to her illustration for the month of October, as I believe she must have gotten a lot of enjoyment out of Halloween celebrations, as her picture for that month is always amusing.

2121,"This RFID wallet is perfect.  Im thankful I was able to purchase it at a reduced price in exchange for an unbiased review.  My old slim case as just about worn out.

Ive been a fan of slim case wallets for years.  The one Ive replaced with this was starting to have issues staying shut so it was time for something new.  What Im loving so much about this credit card holder is:

* Quality construction (hinges and clasp that opens it and holds it shut works great)
* Beautiful (stainless steel is one of my favorite looks, plus the amazing etching)
* Smaller than my old case (but somehow it actually seems roomier!)
* Nothing snags on my pockets (I carry in my front pants pocket)
* Opens more widely than my old one (easier to get to the cards)

I didn't give much thought about my old plain wallet until I got this one and realized how much Im enjoying having a classier version.  Since I don't carry a purse, my wallet now gives me a little style and a smile when I look at it.  Im very pleased with this purchase.

UPDATE:  It's been about 9 months since I started using this wallet and it's holding up really well.  I was worried that it would be all scratched up after a while from the set of keys that I keep in the same pocket with it but that's not been the case.  Very minimal wear on it. And the clasp is still holding strongly despite the fact that I sometimes overstuff it with receipts or folded paper money.",25,5.9972186

The handset cord has a woven fabric over it - nice touch, but it's really short.  The tones sound ""weird"" but they work.  The hook seems sort of fragile; in fact, the whole phone is made of lightweight molded plastic i.e. you probably won't mistake this for the original.  The ringer is just awful.

I have found it to be extremely and efficient, powerful, useful, and more.  I am able to staple at least 20 sheets of regular letter-sized paper that I use in my inkjet printer, as shown.

This is quite a bit larger than I had expected, yet I am thinking that there are a whole lot of people out there who would know what to expect.  The scale compared with the size of the stapler should be apparent in the video I do hope.  I am also thinking that I will be storing this stapler in my utility drawer in a clear jumbo-sized zip-lock freezer bag, rather than in my desk cubby where my manual stapler resides.  My reasoning for this is that there is a loose part sitting atop (a nice staple remover), which meant to be easy to access. Yet, I do not want to have a loose part floating around somewhere.

This silver staple remover is located at the rear of the silver cartridge release which opens the ""drawer"" for your row of ""working"" staples in the center, as well as your two rows of many ""extra"" staples on either side, to ready you for reams of use.

Aside from the fact that the release button does allow you to pull open the magazine tray, you might find that you need to pull with a bit of a struggle.  I am wondering if there is a safety reason for this.  I am not the only user who has noticed this.

If I had read the box in the first place, rather than relying on instructions, It would have been more apparent to me that the amber light displayed when the unit is plugged in is meant as an indication that the stapler is not ready to use yet.  And that is very smart because the stapler will not be ready initially to use until you place your ""working"" staples into the center row, then making it easy for you to be ready for anything thin enough to make it into the slot where the stapler will lock down a staple.

There is a feature which allows for you to steer clear of staple jams.  I have not had any problems yet with potential problems. Also, there is quite a bit of suction at the bottom of this unit which is a very nice stability feature. If you do not wish to ruin the finish on your desk, you might want to plug this in somewhere else.  Why not?  I have wood flooring in my kitchen where my utility drawer is.

This unit works very fast, and I recommend readying yourself for that ""clamping down"" sound.  Another idea of mine is to remove the center row of ""working"" staples from the center row of the pull-out mechanism before your next staple job.  This way the amber light will be on, and the stapler safely not ready to staple when plugged in.

All and all I believe this is a great, attractive, professional 20-sheet electric stapler.  The cord is fairly long, and it will also work on your countertop as shown.",3,14.605746

I must mention that the mat arrived flat which is a good thing so there was no waiting for it to flatten down since it was not rolled up.  It did have a couple indentations from the UPS man placing other packages on top of it, but to my surprise after a bit the dents were gone!  There is no harsh chemical smells even though it is made of a synthetic leather.

The mat is extremely thin and has a felt backing to protect from scratching or damaging the surface of your desk.  It will stay put and won't slide around.  We are using the black mat with a cherry desk.  The iMac, keyboard and Apple Magic Mouse look gorgeous sitting on it.  The mouse reacts perfectly on it.  Besides protecting the desk from nicks, scratches and marks, the mat also makes it easier surface to write in my opinion.  It cushions the pressure you put on your writing instrument and you use less force as you write compared to using a hard surface.  Besides an attractive work area, it makes it functional was well.

2131,"I got old, first-generation flatbed and sheetfed scanners (6-8 years old) clogging up my desktop, so I started out looking for an inexpensive replacement.  After extensive research, I came down on two AIO choices--Brother MFC-5440 and HP Officejet 5510.

  I like the Brother better because it's more solidly built.  The HP should print better photos, but these days you can just buy a cheap high-quality photo printer.  Since I already have a photo printer, so photo printing capability is not my priority. Don't take me wrong. The brother still prints fairly good photos.

  As I said, scanning is my priority.  I was not disappointed. The Brother scans much faster than my old flatbed and the images are far better than my sheetfed.  I like the 35 page ADF; the HP Officejet has only a 20 page ADF.  What's more, the Brother comes with PaperPort, which I've been using for a long time.  The HP Officejet 5510 doesn't come with it, and I'm not even sure whether PaperPort works with it at all.

  Lastly, at this price range, you can't get an AIO with network capability.

  In a word, I'm satisfied with the Brother MFC-5440CN. It's well-built and well-designed. This is my second Brother home office product I own.  While they might not excel in photo printing, overall I think they make good solid office products.",19,9.927355

It writes very dry and rough. Upon closer inspection I see that instead of having a traditional feed like every other fountain pen, they use a small string to carry ink to the nib. What happens is that you get decent flow for the first sentence or so then it gets progressively drier and drier until it won't write anymore because the string can't pull ink fast enough. Perhaps this is some cost saving design but it makes no sense when cheap pens from china that cost around a single dollar will write beautifully.

The final product is great and works well with the spines designed for this style of punch, but the progress may seem slow as you grind through three or four sheets at a time depending on the thickness of the paper.  Great product for the price but not for production work.",5,6.1789722
2165,I received these today. I already had the oil and water color from Southsun I didn't know they were the same pencils now I have double. But I love them they are my go to pencils and for the price you can't beat it. They do lay down well but not as creamy as your Prisma or other expensive pencils. These are great for beginners if you don't want to spend your whole years earning on a good product. These pencils have a lot more brighter colors than Prisma do Prisma are more muted and muddy on colors what do I want to say more tans and brown not many purple. These have bright beautiful greens purple and true red. True colors. They take a light hand to get layers and blend well. I get to the point where I can't lay down anymore colors then that's where the Prisma comes in they lay over well over these so I don't waste my expensive pencils. These are also good for beginners. Love them all. If you want the water color or smaller pack they are called Southsun pencils. Hero are the same thing.,7,6.3426757

Anyway, this is much better build - MDF sides and center support w/ stiff chipboard compartment dividers. Each little chipboard tray has a clip on plastic support on the front to add strength.

I have built a lot of MDF furniture over the years, and generally have no problems. However, this one was a pain. The glued dowels are a great idea, but I'd never used them before. If you buy this, know that each dowel must be put in place quickly after you dip them in water to activate the glue (it dries quickly). Second, the dowels are easy to accidentally put in too deeply, which causes the MDF boards to crack slightly. Worst of all, the instructions are not very detailed, so you will inevitably put it together wrong at least once -- which wouldn't be a problem except for the glue, which makes putting it back together correctly very hard.

I don't ship packages very often and noticed that everytime I went to use the scale I would have to put in fresh batteries.  Lately I've been shipping more frequently - at least a package every week.  Still - every time I use the scale I have to install new batteries.  I shipped a package on Tuesday and had to install new batteries and now 2-days later I had to ship another package and the batteries were dead.

This is a fantastic postal scale.  I really like the bright, large, easy-to-read backlit display and this scale is ACCURATE!  On the several different occasions that I checked on the accuracy of the scale by comparing this scale's readings with the actual weight as measured at the post office's scale the readings were IDENTICAL.  Exactly the same.  I checked at two different post offices locally on several different occasions and the readings were exactly the same.  In the past I would use a kitchen scale and after awhile I got a good feel for the accuracy of that kitchen scale and I would usually add a couple of ounces to the reading to make sure my packages wouldn't be overweight when dropping them off at the post office.  More often than not I would add too much to the reading.  Not a huge deal but now with my American Weigh Scales very accurate scale I don't have to fudge the readings a bit.  Thanks for providing such a fantastic scale at such an affordable price.  I thought I would have to pay at least $75 to get a scale capable of weighing up to 55-lbs at this accuracy.  I really like the ""hold"" button on the side that allows me to lock in the reading when I cannot see the display while weighing large packages.",2,7.8699527

2181,"Likes:  Better than the old Fellowes shredder, it has more features. With my old shredder, I forgot to read the instructions and
did not service the shredder by applying vegetable oil to the cutters after each drawer fill up, so the old one broke down after a couple of years. The drawer size of 9 gallons takes my 13 gallon biodegradable bag nicely. You can stretch the bag over the back of the drawer, and the front has two protruding notches for the bag. I had lots of paper to shred, and completed 9 bags filled over a few days. Machine works well although none are extremely quiet.
The specs. say you can shred 17 sheets. I prefer keeping the number of sheets in the green light. I found the following:
17 sheets = red light.  14-16 sheets = Orange 2 light.  11-13 sheets = Orange 1 light.  9-10 sheets = green 5 light.
  8 sheets = green 4 light.  4-7  sheets = green 3  light.  3 sheets = green 2 light.  2 sheets = green 1 light.

Must use vegetable oil on the cutter after filling each bag. You can buy shredder oil or I assume use any clear vegetable oil.

Dislikes: Very minor issues. The castor wheels really need to be pounded into place.  I used clear shipping tape to smooth the edges inside the drawer around the viewing port. This keeps the bag from tearing when full.  The cut paper tends to bunch up directly under the cutter which trips the ""full' red light. You may have to open the drawer and pat down the paper three or four times before bag is full.  The small bottle of oil supplied is pretty small and you will have to make a stopper for it. Fellowes make a 12 oz. bottle with an extension nozzle that is too large. This really wastes the oil. I found a travel bottle with flip up nozzle that works well (try Target).",7,8.868055

Another reviewer called this pen ""the answer to a question no one asked."" With respect, I don't believe that's true. I believe this question was asked -- in market research commissioned by the Parker company. The question they probably asked high-end pen consumers was, ""Why don't you use fountain pens?"" And the answer was probably, ""I don't like filling them; I'm afraid they'll leak; and I don't like the way the ink stays wet on the paper. But I do like the classy way they look.""

So the flabbergastingly named ""Parker Ingenuity Large Daring Black Rubber and Metal Chrome Trim 5th Technology Mode Pen"" was born. Even the name was clearly the product of a committee poring over market research and message testing results. That's a lot of buzzwords in one name! I intend to memorize the name and say it in full whenever someone asks me about my pen. ""This? Oh, it's just my Parker Ingenuity Large Daring Black Rubber and Metal Chrome Trim 5th Technology Mode Pen.""

Enough about the creation of the pen; the question is, is it a success?

If you forget about the ""5th Technology"" idea, whatever that means, and just consider this pen its own merits, then yes, it's a lovely pen. It's beautifully boxed and, in my opinion, gorgeous. It begs to be touched and handled. It's really substantial, and I like that. I'd go so far as to say it's downright heavy, and I find that pleasant, though obviously YMMV. This pen is designed to impress, and I think it does. I can imagine this as a really nice gift for a person who likes unusual high-end pens, as long as you've made sure first that they're not a true fountain-pen aficionado.

It writes smoothly, and the ink is a nice saturated black, but I have to say the ink and cartridge are quite bland. Generic office bland -- it feels quite a lot like a Pilot Razor Point fineline felt tip pen. There's no variance in the line. I'd go so far as to call it boring. It's got no personality. That could be a good thing if that's the experience you want, which it may well be if you're buying a faux fountain pen instead of a real one. On the plus side, it's predictable: there's no feathering on cheap paper, no smearing of wet ink, no dry start-ups, no stopping to refill, and no chance of leakage in your pocket, bag, or hand.

Is it a good value? All I can say is: $190 bucks is a hell of a lot of cash for a felt tip pen with $8 refills. It appears that Parker deliberately priced this pen to nestle into the low end of the luxury pen market. People seeking practicality or a good deal should look elsewhere. Collectors may enjoy this item, though; Parker is a famous name in the field and this is an attractive and physically imposing item that will probably be quite durable... though it's anyone's guess whether the refills will be available in 50 years, or what they'll cost in the future.

In the end, a ""fountain pen"" without wet ink is a bit like vegan foie gras. Ridiculous, yes? And yet, go to your health food store and you'll find ""faux gras."" This is the ""faux gras"" of fountain pens, aimed at a consumer who wants to enjoy the prestige of a fancy fountain pen but can't abide the care and feeding of the beast. As a ""5th Technology,"" it's a washout.  As a high-end felt-tip with an odd conceit, I think it's a success -- a long as you're not expecting it to be a substitute for a fountain pen.

*** UPDATE 1/2013: If you read the comments, you'll see some people thought this pen should have gotten a bad rating just because it is a ""Veblen good"" -- that is, intentionally priced way too high to give it ""prestige."" I don't agree. I reviewed it based on the premise that the reader would consider buying a $190 felt tip pen. If you hate the whole idea and think ""luxury"" pens are a ripoff, fair enough, but then no review will be useful to you. However, if you are considering the idea, you need to know what you get for your $190.

I had originally given this 4 stars, because it was attractive and pleasant to use, if uninteresting. Then I downgraded the review to 3 stars because the pen insert got dry way too prematurely, despite being carefully capped between uses. Really, for $10 for a *refill*, the insert should last at least as long as the ol' reliable Pilot Razor Point.

But now I'm changing the review to 1 star. Turns out that the rubber exterior cladding on the pen, which felt really nice in the hand when I first started using the pen, is nothing but a thin layer of apparently sprayed-on rubberish black stuff that chips off, revealing raw metal underneath. How did I find this out? Did I take the pen on safari? Did I give it to a gorilla to practice penmanship? No, I put it in the pen cup on my desk between occasional uses. Yep, the pen cup on my desk was more than this finish could handle. Now it's chipping off the bottom and the whole thing is revealed as regrettably cheaply made. (To see the damage, check out the customer photo I downloaded; it's in ""view and share related images"" near the product photo at the top.) For $190, that's just unacceptable. Even for pen collectors, pursuers of ""luxury,"" etc, I have to say: give this one a pass.",227,14.571967
2185,"When the printer works, it prints very nice pictures, quite sharp with amazing accurate colors and saturation.  However, it's an ink jet printer, with all the evils associated with ink jets.  Clogged nozzles, missing lines in the print, and a very small ink supply.  If you do frequent nozzle cleanings, you'll restore the print quality, but that is a waste of ink.  It has a couple improvements in that the ink ostensibly doesn't fade like normal ink does, and there are six jets, so color mixing is more accurate.  Furthermore, the prints are waterproof.  When printing through Epson's Film Factory, the printer crops the borders of the photos, so you'll lose the edges of your pics.  This may happen if you print directly from the card; I haven't checked.  This cropping is really an inexcusable bug in the process.

2188,"After my son's school pencil box was misplaced never to be found again I purchased these color pencils as a replacement for the set of color pencils that had been lost in the box. I'm not terribly impressed. The colors are adequate, more to pastel than vibrant, and blend only moderately if uniform strokes are used. My son did like that they erased but doesn't like the feel of pencil drag on the paper or the way they break so much. Most of the pencils have broken leads so when they are sharpened two or three goes are often needed to get past the next break in the lead. The wood is soft and crackles and breaks when sharpened with my fine point Kum sharpener (I love that sharpener; you should see what it can do with a Palomino 602 or even a Ticonderoga). They do much better with the less pointed Staedtler sharpener.

2193,"I have been a graphic artist for some time now, and I am used to having frustrations with trying to print out things that I need.  I decided to do something custom to test out these menu cards for.  Wow.  Talk about a long drawn out situation!

WHAT IS THIS PAPER LIKE?
The paper is great quality.  The texture is very nice and the color is more of a cross between ivory and white than it is a bright white.  The problem I have with it is that the perforations are evenly spaced.  That means that there is no room for printer bordering as most printer drivers have.  That means that it is nearly impossible (I have not found a way yet) to print equally spaced cards on each section.

HOW DOES THIS PAPER PRINT OUT?
USING CORELDRAW
The idea of this paper is to have a template to use.  Well, I prefer CorelDraw which I have the current version of x7 and the template is not included.  No problem.  I decided to make my own template.  Unfortunately this did not work out right because again- we are back at the printer borders which force the three designs into an uneven layout when printing no matter what adjustments I tried to make.

I was trying to print out a custom door hanger for my husband's business.  This allowed for a hole to be punched out of the top to hang the card on a doorknob.  There was no way to make three equal cards.  The only way I could do it was to allow for the larger size on the end and have to trim it off later.  Well, who wants to do THAT?

USING ONLINE AVERY
In order to use my CorelDraw files, I had to convert the graphics to bitmaps.  Then I had to export the entire file into jpg format so that I could upload it to the Avery online layout service.

I did manage to figure out how to do this without losing too much visual integrity from my original printing, and it was pretty easy to adjust and layout the first page in their edit program.  I didn't have any problem with severe time lag or anything so all went well.

The time came to print.

*sighs*

Here we go again.  Despite using the online Avery template, I still had the third card thrown off physically so the only way to make it look truly professional is to trim the third card somewhat.  This just seems like a lot of work for something that is supposed to be automatic.

USING WORD TEMPLATE
My last attempt was with using the Word (.doc) template.  That looked easy.  Yeah.  Right.  I managed to get the files to translate somewhat to the Word program but the quality was deteriorated quite a bit.  I tried the print and again, the cards were off.

FINAL COMMENTS
I gave this three stars because in the past when making business cards and other business files as well as using card stock, the cards always allowed for a larger bottom margin when printing and this piece was perforated to come off so all cards were equal.  This card stock does not have that, and I find it frustrating.  I really wish it did.

I will use this but not without grumbling.  I should not have to do the trimming on the third card.  Isn't that what this card stock is about- ease of use?

WHO MIGHT LIKE THIS
If you are a person who just wants to do some quick little menu cards or signs for a craft table or wedding cards at tables, etc, and you are not bothered by one card in three being off center, then this might be for you.

If you are a person who just needs a quick simple line of text printed and being off center on the third card does not bother you, then by all means this might meet your needs just fine.

Perhaps there are newer printers that do not need this margin layout that I don't own or know about.  As it stands with my HP printer that is only a few years old, these cards are more work than they are worth- unless I have some spare time I want to cut paper in and no other options.",3,7.6125336

I'll admit, since the computer age kicked in, my handwriting has suffered. Because I don't want to look like some third grader just learning cursive (or not, as is the case in some schools now), I've found that there are a few pens that work with me to create handwriting that is legible and appropriately ""adult-ish"". My go-to used to be the Zig pigment ink pens, but those aren't made any longer, so I've been searching for a replacement.

I've found I like gel pens better than regular ink pens, the smooth flow makes it easier to create nice looking handwritten notes, however, most gel pens will write nicely for awhile, then have annoying issues with blobs, or they refuse to write on shinier paper (like thermal receipts). Because of these issues I'd switched to mechanical pencils for most of my note-taking, but a penciled note isn't something I'm willing to send a client, so I continued to look for a good pen.

Initially I wasn't sure I liked the Uni-Ball Signo 307, it is very lightweight, with a slimmer body than most other gel pens. After spending a day with it though, I've come to love the slim feel and light weight. Of course the only thing that really matters is how it writes. Ink delivery is smooth, there is little to no drag, but the pen does hold onto the paper well enough so it's easy to control (some gel pens have too little resistance and they seem to move across the paper too quickly). The ink doesn't fuzz at all and leaves a nice crisp line on regular inkjet and writing paper. It also dries more quickly than the Pilot gel ink and regular Bic Stic ink.

I've included a photo showing 5 different pens writing on the same surface. You can see the Zig has some fuzzing, and the Pentel smeared more than a minute after I'd written with it. The Zig, Pentel, and Pilot do better with writers who don't hesitate on the paper as these like to leave blobs when you stop moving. The Uni-Ball 307 doesn't leave blobs, even if you leave the pen on the paper for up to 5 seconds before continuing. The Pilot has an annoying habit of laying down a much heavier line when you're writing slowly.

I'm really pleased with these pens, and the price is the same as what I was paying for the Pilot pens, so I'm definitely switching.",18,10.40623

2206,"The calculator works well but has issues with colors used to differentiate secondary and tertiary functions labeled above the keys.
These functions are accessed using either the Shift key or the Alpha key.  The shift functions are colored coded in brown and the Alpha functions are color coded in maroon.  In house lighting, for example in a living room, I found it difficult to tell what color was used on the alternate functions.  The shift functions are listed above the keys to the left while the Alpha functions are above the key on the right.  Some keys however have only one alternate function I found it hard to tell which shift/Alpha key to use.  The calculator has several operating modes ranging from scientific, programmer (hex, octal, decimal), and statistical.  Most operations are performed by entering an equation's values and operations from left to right.  There are a small number of cases however where the operation must be entered right to left.  I was disappointed in the programmer mode since it did not have logical shift left/right or rotate bits left/right.  What it offered was Casio's version a of a shift without any useful application.

The two features that were the most awkward to learn were the ""Calc"" and ""Solve"" equation keys. This is where some operations are entered in right to left which I found confusing.",2,8.868848

It has a cheap junky feel and the keyboard never worked right. Where the old models had solid color molded in, this has a painted surface that you know won't stand the test of time. The software is full of bugs too. The final straw is that it eats batteries like they are going out of style.

Mine died completely last week after a short period of little use. It is remarkable how bad this product is compared to the past models. I have many 20 year old HP calculators that work like new, and by that I mean without bugs and a keyboard that is great.

Also, the reference blocks are not based on US dimensions such as 3""X5"", 4""X6"", 5""X7"", 8""X10"", and business cards. They are based on European dimensions for A3, A4, A5, A6 and business cards. The product description write-up and photo on Amazon does not make this apparent. (I will add a better photo making this more apparent.)
The 'adjustable backstop' with the red button release will move on you regardless if the release red button is pressed or not.
Plan on holding down whatever you are cutting, as the clamp isn't much.
When you lift up on the Guillotine be sure you hold the base down, as it will lift up with the Guillotine.  One good thing, I should build-up my muscles in my right arm, as the Guillotine is a little stiff to lift.
One good thing is the Guillotine isn't a sharp blade. The cutting is based upon the Guillotine and the metal edge plate shearing the paper.

After signing a few documents it began to skip, and now it is hardly writing at all. In a way, it almost feels wrong to give the pen a bad review based on its bad ink refill, but as it is the original (and included) ink tube, I can't justify a higher star rating.

2213,"My family has big boxes of 35mm slide photos that my parents took starting back in the 50s when they were newlyweds.

We've hung onto these slides all these years and I kind of assumed that we'd eventually take them someplace to have them professionally transferred to digital images.  But now we can do this ourselves.  I'm pretty excited.

I was surprised how easy this converter was to use.  I didn't bother trying to connect it to a laptop.  I just plugged in a big fat SD card and started scanning slides.  The preview window is a little smaller than I would have hoped, but that's OK.  It's still big enough to get a general idea of what the side is and to see whether you put the slide in upside down.

2229,"Wanted a phone for home use and home office use and this is perfect. The sound quality is fantastic. The corded base unit with speakerphone is great for the office and I have the handsets for household use. The speed dials on the base unit are great for frequent calls. The answering machine is simple to set up and operate and works great. You can retrieve messages and turn it on and off either remotely or from any of the handsets. The speakerphone is very clear. I thought I would use the speakerphone occasionally, but I use it almost exclusively for placing and receiving calls. Everyone I've asked has said the quality on the other end is very clear. A previous reviewer recommended buying a longer cord for the base unit and I'm glad I did because the cord it comes with is pretty short. Easy to set up. The instruction manual is a little overwhelming at first, but if you just focus on one thing at a time, it's actually pretty straightforward.

You can transfer phone numbers stored on the base unit or the handsets to all the other phones automatically with a push of a button. Another feature I didn't expect but absolutely love is the fact that the handsets also have speakerphone capability which means you can set the handset down and keep on talking! The range of the handsets is good and I haven't had any issues with interference despite the fact that I have one of the handsets sitting right next to a wireless router and bunch of wireless equipment. If you have the base unit and a handset going on speakerphone at the same time, you have to keep a little bit of distance between them or the base unit squeals. The base unit is a good size and stays put despite not being that heavy. The mute and hold and speakerphone functions work great. The handsets have a jack for a headphone.

One of the great features for me is that we have frequent power outages where we live and the base unit on this phone will keep working even when the power goes out. You don't need a phone jack to set up the handsets which is great because you can put them anywhere you have a power outlet. The call blocking features allow you to block selected calls from ever ringing your phone again! I'm definitely going to use this on the next telemarketer that calls my house repeatedly and refuses to leave a message! These phones pretty much do everything. I love these phones. Would absolutely buy them again.

2230,"So here I was looking for a Laminator, I decided to buy this one as it came up high in search and had decent reviews on Amazon. I think I am like most people and want to be careful when buying products with plugs. In opening the box, the laminator seemed to be similar to other units and brands I have seen in the market.the unit and how to use it and I was immediately surprised by a couple of things once I checked the manual and the product.

-Product Warranty - I always check to see what the warranty of a product is and if I have to register in order to make this valid. Apache states 1 years manufacturer's warranty. I thought that seemed standard. Then I went to check to see how I register for this, etc. and nowhere in the manual does it list where to do this. In fact there is no contact information on the company that makes this at all. So how would I ever use this warranty? Strange.

-Performance claims - There seems to be a lot of confusion over how this unit actually performs.
Speed of laminations - On the box it states 1ppm , which I assume is page per minute and in the manual 25cm/min. Which is correct? Is there a conversion chart from cm to page? Don't think that exists.
Warm up time - On the box it says 4minute warm up and in the manual it states 3-5. Which is right?
So I start to think that the company that makes this laminator didn't even test and validate what they put on their product.

 I decided to check the machine a little bit closer. I wanted to see where it was made. Nowhere on the machine or manual does it say Made In .... Country. There is a sticker on the bottom of the machine 110-120V. Ok, I thought that is something. But guess what in the US we use 120v!  So now I am beginning to second guess my purchase a bit and wanted to do one more check. Most things in my house with a plug on them have some sort of safety certification, such as UL or CTL, so I began to look for this . This would tell me that a company put in the effort to have this product tested and certified. Well guess what it didn't have that either! Anyway, am going to try to return this product. I am sure there are a lot of people pleased with this product, but I just won't plug something in my house that appears to be missing some basic information and doesn't have anybody to contact if I have an issue or question.

I would avoid buying this machine at all costs",2,12.414601

  If you travel with your laptop, as I do, you may find that the touchpad isn't enough. (Personally, I really don't like touchpads: they're never responsive or accurate enough.) Most mouse pads consist of a seemingly smooth surface bonded to a usually rubber like bottom.

  The Wow! Pad is different. It is extremely thin. The mouse surface is made of some proprietary material that is incredibly smooth. I use a high-resolution mouse and thought everything was fine with my regular mouse pad. When I used the Wow! Pad I was absolutely amazed at how much more responsive my mouse was. If Wow! Pad had the marketing smarts, they would set up actual demos in stores or at least put up a video on their web site. As it is, I bought mine solely because of the size.

  As a laptop accessory, it's really great. It is so thin that you can sandwich it between your keyboard and screen (but make sure you put it there with the mouse surface, not the bottom, against the screen). The bottom of the Wow! Pad is some kind of high adhesion material, like those pads they sell for holding stuff temporarily on your dashboard.

  So there it is: a review of a mouse pad. But, seriously, the Wow! Pad is unique, truly makes a difference in the responsiveness of your mouse and, in the smaller size, is a greatr laptop accessory.

It would not print a test pattern.  Eventually had to call PB for service work on the mailing machine.  Of course the tech claimed the problem was using after-market ink.  Again, I've had success for years with LD ink.  So he cleaned the machine, changed the print head and installed a PB cartridge.  That cartridge lasted until middle of 2/15.  Installed new LD cartridge - bought 2 on 9/14 to have as back stock.  Installed the new LD cartridge 2/15.  There was nothing I could do to make the 1st work.  Ok fine.  I open the second, given the cost, no big deal.  2nd will not work either - a blurred or partially missing test pattern - plus a number of prints on envelopes that eventually required old-school stamps - what a waste.  Consulted LD's website - none of their solutions helped.  Tried to return via Amazon - but they only back the product for 30-days  - even though the box from LD says ""100% Satisfaction Guaranteed"".  So went back to Amazon and found a seller of PB ink - ouch - $75 - but less than the $90 through PB.  When it arrived, plugged it in and the machine has run perfect since.  Contacted LD directly via their website - told them the story and was only asking to swap the cartridges that don't work for replacements and I was willing to ship the bad one's back for their QC people to review.  I was very politely no thank you and to have a nice day.",2,7.6683803
2251,"I'm using these to write my students' names on their desks. Otherwise, they just play with their nametags (5th graders even!). I like them pretty well, but the red has started to pool up ink & be unreliable after writing about 55 names. The silver is working just fine, and I haven't opened the others. Kids can wash their desks with regular school-issued cleaner, and the ink isn't affected. If you want to try it, the print comes right off with alcohol wipes, so it's easy to change names, but be careful not to let kids use their hand-sanitizer at their desks. :-)",8,7.7162895
2252,"I just love these. I've had them for three years now. I agonized over the price before buying my first set, but I have never regretted it. Eventually I even bought the set of 72 colors.  I'm attaching a picture I painted with them.  Here are a few things I've learned:

1. THESE ARE REALLY FUN AND FREEING
Since ordering my own, I have ordered many sets as gifts. These are perfect for people who want to get back into painting but don't have the time, and for people like me who fear making mistakes on a ""masterpiece."" These are just really fun, and so easy. But the intense, saturated colors can give near-professional results.

2. SO SIMPLE, AND EASY SET-UP
With these pencils, some paper, and a simple water brush, you'll have everything you need. I take this on trips, and once I even painted a whole picture while sitting in a plastic chair at the airport. It's that easy, and not messy at all.

3. USE WITH A WATER BRUSH
You can use the brush to take paint right off the pencil, and paint just like normal. Water brushes basically clean themselves, so you only need one, and they're cheap. I have this one, but there are a lot of others out there:
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pentel-Arts-Aquash-Fine-Point-Water-Brush-Large-FRHBBP/dp/B002LG0YSO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pentel Arts Aquash Fine Point Water Brush, Large (FRHBBP)</a>

4,.USE TO LAYER COLORS
Since these are permanent if you wet them and then let the paint dry, every layer you put down will be set. You can layer to your heart's content with no muddy colors.

5. BE AWARE THAT THESE ARE NOT ALWAYS LIGHTFAST
Some of these colors are more lightfast than others (you can google it), but the lighter colors, yellows in particular, are not lightfast at all. The color will start fading pretty quickly. So take photos. : )

These are on a whole different level from any other watercolor pencils I have ever tried. I just wish they didn't fade. But I love them. They're really fun.",47,11.456796
2253,"My family are a bunch of stress and nerve fidgeters, and I finally decided I needed a solution when I pulled out a large patch of my beard on my drive home from work.

2255,"Bought this to house some electronics for work and while they do the job well enough, the plastic bins are really cheapy. Unfortunately several of the carts ordered had cracked bins. Normally I would have tried to get them fixed through the manufacturer but in this case we needed them asap, so I ordered an extra. Basically every other cart set had a cracked bin. The shipping package was in fine condition, so I believe these are just packaged poorly from the manufacturer. A shame, but they do their job well enough.",2,4.1789565
2256,"Pros: 1. I would be cautious about the use of the printer in a large office, but (with the below exception) the parts quality and build of the printer are superior to competitors in its price range--and far superior to consumer grade HP. 2. The print quality is fine. Speed is fair. 3. The unit isn't fussy in its paper handling. I have had few paper jams and all have been easy to clear.

Cons: 1. I am using the printer in a wireless setup with an iMac, running Snow Leopard 10.6. This is far from an exotic system. The process for wireless setup was designed by a sadist. I could not have believed that establishing a wireless connection could be as difficult as it is with this machine. I would not have bought the printer if I had read the installation instructions first. (Go the website for the most recent instructions; the CD-ROM and instructions that came with the printer are obsolete.) 2. As with other printers I have owned in this price range, the support flap to hold printed pages extends beyond the front of the printer and is extremely flimsy. It is waiting to be broken off. In fairness to its customers, Brother ought to offer free replacement parts whenever they are needed. (The printer ejects its pages with enthusiasm. Without the flap, pages spill freely onto the floor.) 3. I will not give a top rating to any printer that is shipped with less than a full amount of ink/toner. I know it is common practice to ship printers with ""starter"" cartridges, but a manufacturer should try to build loyalty with its customers. Sooner or later the customer will need to buy new toner--and eventually a new printer. The practice is also environmentally irresponsible.

The Con list is longer. For perspective: I have had laser printers in the $150 to $350 range by HP, NEC, and Samsung. The NEC and Samsung each gave me about 3 good years of use; the HP about 6 unfortunate months. This is the best of the batch.

As I start to forget the installation process, I might add a star. If I ever have to repeat the process, I will delete one.

Seven month update: The unit continues to work very well. It is sturdy and dependable. I haven't had to reinstall the unit, and, unlike HP, Brother doesn't constantly send ""up-dates"" that function mostly as adware and slow my operating system. Paper is often curled when first printed, but pages flatten within an hour or two. As other reviewers note, the printer will stop printing well before a cartridge is empty. See those reviews for work arounds. I would buy the printer again, but this latter issue is why I did not raise my initial 3 star rating. If you trust the printer to monitor its supply of toner, you could, over the course of a year, spend hundreds of dollars to buy new cartridges before they are necessary.",4,14.600676
2257,"These are the perfect sized envelopes for handmade cards- normal sized paper cut in half and folded in half.  They aren't terribly thick envelopes, but aren't cheap feeling either.  They are perfect and didn't break the bank.  I will definitely be buying them again!!",9,4.6688924
2258,I absolutely adore these highlighters and have bought both these and the Pastel ones. I love the colors and the window allows you to view the text you are highlighting so you are very accurate.

2259,"First off they are in no way comparable to my Rite in the Rain notebooks I have used for over 10 years.  These arrived in a sealed environmentally safe bag ( which worried me right from the start ) . When I opened this bag I got the stink others warned about, and after handling the pads the stink stayed on my hands and when I later ate some chips I found that it does not taste good either.

added note - WASH YOUR HANDS AFTER HANDLING THESE PADS  don't know what they are treated with but it is NASTY and DON""T RUB YOUR EYES until you wash you hands .

as for the pads themselves - getting past the ""treatment"" applied to them ( which still stinks eight days later and STILL comes off on my hands even after airing out for eight days ) the pages fit VERY loosely allowing the cover to slide laterally causing the pad to look like a deck of cards stacked off center ( a problem I NEVER have had with MY Rite in the Rain pads, even after carrying on active duty abuse  -  and 10 years later of use ).

Do they work? well yes you can write on them, the don't bleed through marker too much ( can bee seen on other side but doesn't bleed through ).

I will keep them for use in the garage -  BUT will NEVER buy them again",6,5.586315
2260,"What can I tell you?  Our shredder died a bit ago and we are drowning in mail.  Considering everything is mostly e-billed now, I feel that I am still swimming in a sea of paper.  Out of desperation I have been disposing of the mail and praying that the disgusting garbage on top of it will deter an identity thief.  I know, I know... garbage stops no one.  I was excited to receive this medium-use shredder and excitedly put it to use once the box was torn open.

Compared to our old model, this feels like a solid machine.  It no longer tips over when you bump it in passing.  It is also a bit larger and no longer seems like a small wastebasket.  The weight feels evenly distributed for once and I honestly feel that, that tiny difference makes a world of difference in the overall balance.

Now onto the shredding action:  It shreds beautifully and it is better than manually tearing up your mail and dumping it on the curb.  This isn't the safest model but then again, you aren't paying for TOP security.  I believe that this model will suffice with the average user/consumer's needs.  I did not test the paper clip claims, but it did wonderfully through staples and an old credit card.  It did not groan as our older shredder had done.  IT also claims to shred 10 sheets at a time.  I had received a Direct Tv mailer with referrals which was the thickness of approximately 10 sheets.  The shredder groaned and painfully chugged along.  I DO NOT recommend that you shred any more than 8-9 sheets depending on thickness.  We thought that it would get stuck but luckily we used the 'reverse' function for a second which allowed a second go towards the end of the envelope.

The feeding slot is metal and has a 'safe sense' feature which knows when hands are inserted instead of fingers.  The shredder will shut down in that instance.  I have taken one star away because after 6 minutes of continuous shredding the unit will go into automatic 'sleep' for 30 minutes so that it can cool down.  I have not tested the theory because I truly did not want to wait for the 30 minute recycle time.  A positive was the on/off button located at the side.  NO longer will I plug in my machine and have it start shredding any old remnants that have remained from our last session.  There is also a little indicator that will alert you in the case of any overheating.

Personally, I highly recommend this unit for our home use/needs.  A small business could possibly get good use, but nothing larger.  The 30 minutes of mandatory time outs would annoy any employee.  This product seems sleek, sturdy and comes with 1 year warranty/5 year blade warranty.  Only time will tell if it will hold up longer than our previous model of a different brand.  I believe that it will.",23,12.025607
2261,"The handle is a decent wooden one.  Nothing special but a good size and feels like it will last.  It's just a smidge longer than a full size bic disposable lighter (pic below).  It comfortable to hold and use.

The actual stamp feels like solid metal.  Seems well crafted and clear, with no blurs or burrs or snags. Releases well.

The only suggestion I would make (tho it's not a -star issue to me) is to put some kind of mark at the base, so you can tell your alignment before putting it in the wax.  It's easy to get slightly crooked.  I'm going to try just a dot of superglue and see how that works.

I'm good about updating if the need arises.  Any questions, feel free to comment or email.",5,3.8412826
2262,"I purchased this printer about a month ago to replace my Brother HL2240, which I loved.  I needed a document feeder since I'm trying to get rid of some of the paper around here and had such a happy experience with that Brother and this was basically the same.  I thought everything was going to be pretty much the same - WRONG.  On the first printer, when the low toner warning came on you could push the start button, like, 12 times or something and it would quit.  Then after a while it would start up again and you'd just repeat.....and keep going until the toner REALLY ran out of ink.

NOT this one.  Besides the same complaint as others; the warning pop-ups driving you crazy, the real kicker that when IT decides you should replace the toner, the printing STOPS!  Will NOT continue until you replace.  I haven't seen any decline yet in the quality of printing with that cartridge, but who cares?  Yes, I took it out, shook it, ran the wire, everything I know to do.

OK, I just decided to go ahead and pull up the users guide (novel thought!) and it does address how to get around the stoppage on page 30. But what a pain!  Will be interesting if those stupid pop-ups continue......

2276,"If you are a lefty like me, you know how difficult it can be to find a pen that makes your writing look...not horrible.

This is the pen. Let me break it down for you:

PROS:
- SUPER fine tip - much finer than most you'll find in American pens. This means even the worst handwriting is going to look notably neater
- Great ink formula - no smudging
- The kicker: this is an erasable pen! Not like the really bad Papermate models of your high school career, either. Fully erasable ink with a narrow and precise clear rubber eraser at the very tip of the pen. So sleek that I didn't even notice it was there the first time I bought this pen (woops)

In essence, you can get dark, precise lines in your planner and while writing notes without fearing the inevitable mistake or having to invest in white out which can be a pain to use, make pages look messy, and is just one more thing to carry. My Chinese notes have never looked better and let's face it, I have to erase those a lot.

CON:
- This ink reacts interestingly with other inks. When I color over it with a Copic marker, the ink has been known to fade dramatically. Certainly not a dealbreaker but something to be aware of.
- Wish there was a clip on the side of this pen! Then it would be perfect.

The design of the pen is a bit of a wash, as well. I like the petite, minimalist build but the downside of it is that this pen is easier than most to lose.

Overall, not perfect but pretty darn close. Would recommend any day of the week.",5,8.074221

One by one, I set up my folders and expense categories using the 'free trial' software that they have you install via an included CD. Two precious hours into it, I get a pop up error from Windows saying something to the effect of ""Neat has stopped working. Windows cannot find a solution to the problem, so Windows will now close the program"" (BTW, I'm using Windows 10). So I think, ""OK - no biggie - just close it out, reopen it, and it'll work again"". Nope. Same error. Reboot and try again. Nope. Same error. OH GEESH! OK, so I Google ""Neat has stopped working"". I get tons of Google search results. I go to the Neat company's site. They have all kinds of different instructions (and various 'possibilities' of 'why' this error could occur - but there's no one clear reason!)

2279,"This can only scan at 300dpi through the document feeder. That means you can't automatically scan a stack of documents at 600dpi. You'd have to use the flatbed one at a time, and that isn't an option for legal size. I suspect HP knows the document feeder is of low quality and precision, thus making 600 dpi impossible through the feeder. If that is the case, then one can expect the copying via document feeder will be limited to 300dpi. By contemporaneous standards that is a really bad low quality copier. To understand how bad, consider that it takes 600 dpi to do a decent copy of 300 dpi printed material. 300 dpi copying of 300 dpi material will result in noticeable degradation. The kicker is that most laser printers these days (even the cheapest ones) are 600 dpi.

The TWAIN driver is one of the worst in the business - no image preview, and can't select scan area. The color mode and resolution settings (two most important attributes of a scan) are put on different UI tabs making them inconvenient to adjust and not easily visible. Contrast adjustment is in yet another place. Even the most simple adjustments hidden among different tabs and pull downs. The HP scanning software only allows saving to pdf and jpeg, with no way to select jpeg (or pdf image) quality.

For scans initiated from the MFP, you can only choose color and greyscale (mislabeled on menus), no B/W. That makes it useless for most text document scanning. Even with the scanning software, if you set B/W the resulting file is still 10 times larger than it should be given the amount of lossless compression typically achievable with most text documents. (I tested this by scanning the same document in B/W with HP Scan vs Paperport software.) The next time you receive a very large email with a very simple document scan, you can blame it on this kind of incompetence. But it gets worse, as it seems HP uses jpeg to compress the ""B/W"" document scan. Jpeg is designed to compress natural photos where there tend to be gradual changes in luminosity (brightness). It is explicitly bad for text where one wants sharp letters (with very sudden changes between black letters and white background). So you wind up with bad jpeg artifacts. Sensible OEMs will do a real B/W scan and use Lempil-Ziv compression (like WinZip).",100,14.621343

The color of the ink is now a cheap and ugly blue-gray and the pen no longer glides.

Amazon has been doing an outstanding job of reducing excessive packaging, but this is quite ridiculous.
The product came in the outer box ONLY - what you see in the product photo - no extra packaging, buffer, etc. - NOTHING.

The product deserves a lot more than the shoddy packaging Amazon sends it in, because these papers are superb, and an awesome deal.

I do think this writes better/more smoothly than a lot of other fine point pens that I've used.  I don't have to scribble a bunch to get it started, even if it's been a few days since I last used it.  Which is great for any ballpoint pen, honestly.

These did a fine job with both of these tasks although admittedly I used them more for writing than erasing.

Could be a quality control issue or they got an older box than I got.  Still, as a pencil I have no complaints and no reason to give less than 5 stars.  they are a good size for hand holding and fit nicely behind the ear.  What more could a pencil shopper as for.

2296,"I needed to label each page of a mountain of paper. A rubber stamp was the obvious answer. I could have bought one pre-made with specific text but for a few dollars more I got the Cosco(R) Self-Inking stamp kit. It was pretty easy to pick out the letters from the two trays of rubber letter images and form my label and the resulting stamp works great! When I finish this project, I'll be able to re-use the stamp kit for other projects in the future so ultimately I'll save money. This model allows up to 5 lines of text. Each line can hold about 20 characters. The kit includes 7 copies of the letters A-Z in each of two sizes however only capital letters are included - no lower case. There is also a more limited selection of accented characters and punctuation symbols. Finally there are some odd itesm such as the image of a mailbox, various check boxes, and some odd things like ""ISDN"" and ""IBAN"".

Overall I a very pleased. It was easy to set up and the stamp creates a nice sharp image and is very easy to use.

It would be nice if more rubber images were available either in the kit or as an optional accessory.  Lower case letters would be first on my list followed closely by additional copies of numbers and capital letters. Because there are only four sets of numbers in each size, you could run out of a given digit (like 0 or 1!) very easily. A larger type size would also be handy.

You may find it handy to wear a headset magnifier when setting up the stamp. The letters are small (and of course, backwards) and you need to keep your hands free to do the work.",35,10.826291

2300,"There are quite a few things I like about these markers:

1. It is a medium with no learning curve.  As someone who has worked with hot glass for over 10 years.... it is sure nice to have something you can pick up without worry, danger or the need for lessons to get basic technique down.  These are a lot of fun to use, more so than I would have thought.  I like the brush tip.  The ink flow is somewhere between a pen and brush.  Between the 2 you can get quite a variety of effects.  A light tough gives you feathering, a little more pressure a solid line.  You can vary the width and intensity depending on how you hold it and how hard you press.

2.. The colors are bright and water fast.  I was a little worried at first and washed the first shirt I made inside out so that if it bled it would do so on the t-shirt and not other clothing.  No bleedine (either as I drew or in the wash) no problem!  I would not give these to a 5 year old... who knows how long it would take to get off skin (but the same can be said of any permanent marker).

3.  The ink will take on a variety of surfaces.  I'd planned to use these with sneakers and a canvas bag which is very plain/ dull.  I tried them out first on some inexpensive blank t-shirts I got to work in (yard work, hot glass... where I do not want  good clothing ruined).  So, I figured since these were meant to be effectively disposable it was a good way to try out the markers before using them on more expensive, less easily replaced items.  I liked the results so much and had so much fun decorating the shirts... they are no longer as disposable as they once were ;).

4.  They can also be used for basic Id on clothing, lunch boxes.... things which tend to get lost at school.  The colors make it a lot more fun!

Note: the ""stained"" in the title is an appropriate descriptor both because of the permanence and because of the transparency.  What you get are colors much like stained glass.  The transparency gives you nice bright colors, but (and this is my only issue... not complaint exactly) because the colors are transparent they do not show up as well on darker cloth.  They worked well on white, light blue... but only the black & blue were very visible on a maroon shirt.  Maybe (hoping) they will come out with some opaque colors (like the gel pens).  That would open up a whole new range.  It's a small limitation and one I would not have thought of had I not gone hog wild with this set of markers.

When you consider the cost of art media, or a designer shirt.... you get a lot for the money!  You can not buy even a screened artist shirt for what these markers cost.  For just over $10 you can have a one of a kind item! Less expensive and just and enduring as those calanders made with kid's art e.g.  I am thinking of all kinds of ways these can be used.  I may have to order another set (and if they come out with opaque colors, will get one for sure)",106,8.684912

2303,"I recently moved to a new house.  I was using a combination of Rubbermaids that had been through two or three moves, new boxes, old boxes given to me by a coworker, etc., to pack my stuff.  Some of these things had previously been labeled.  I wanted a cue for the movers as to where to put each box and I needed it to be uniform so they wouldn't accidentally pay attention to an old set of directions.  So I decided to try these.

And, although that's not their original intent, these make very good moving box labels.  The white color with red border stands out against the brown of cardboard, so it's easy to see.  You can write on them with Sharpie and it dries quickly and stays put.  These stick easily to cardboard boxes (but don't easily come off).

The Good: color laser, quality is great, wireless scanning to Mac and Windows, and wireless printing from Mac, Windows, and iphone/ipad. It also has ability to print via email but i never used that feature.

The Not so Good: you get what you pay for... startup time is kind of long and loud, as is the ""prep process"" that the unit does before each job. Occasionally, printing a PDF document from my iPhone causes the printer to lock up and require a hard reboot. Printing to non-standard paper size is a pain, as you have to manually press ""ok"" on the printer after printing each page (even though i set the correct paper size on the computer, the printer kept saying ""unexpected paper size""). Additionally, initial setup and then subsequent installation on any Windows PC's requires you to connect the PC to the printer via USB (but after that it works wirelessly). Once the printer is on the network, Mac installation does not require USB cable.

Conclusion: For around $300 (i paid $299 at Staples back in May 2012) its a great deal. Of course, like all printers these days, you pay for it in the ink/toner... and i do recommend HP toner over the cheaper knock-offs, which i have tried and don't work as well. I haven't yet purchased toner, but will soon. If you need a printer for everyone in the house to share, this is the one to get. Just keep in mind that it will probably last 2-3 years.",12,9.305246

2311,"These Smead hanging folders are exactly what they say they are - a heavy duty hanging file folder with easy to adjust label tabs.

First off I like the heavy duty paper.  They are made just enough better than the cheaper store-brand hanging files I purchased which tend to rip/fall apart when I overburden them with too many documents (which I seem to have a habit of)!  These have so far held up to my over-stuffing abuse - not only do they stay in place but the metal rods that are used to ""hang"" the folders into the cabinet don't bend easily (like those store brand ones do).

Second, there's the ""easy slide tab.""  I admit that it took me a minute to figure out how this works.  I got the tab snapped onto the folder easily but wasn't sure about the sliding part.  the instructions say ""to reposition tab, flex the tab away from you and slide to desired folder slot.""  On first try it didn't budge and I thought maybe I had snapped the tab in too tightly, but apparently it was just the way I was trying to do it.  You need to just do it pretty much in one motion, flex it back a bit while sliding it.  Easy-peasy!

I had no trouble getting the paper label into the tab.  Be sure to follow the instructions and insert the label with the crease side down.  This is because the bottom part is just a bit thicker to accommodate the folded paper label.  Plus, you can easily remove the label from the back by pinching the end of the paper label that sticks into the middle back of the plastic tab and then sliding it out.

I like these and now have ordered a second box for my small amount of home office files.  It's a minor enhancement to a product that is used by just about everyone in an office (and many who aren't!)  Some things you can't really improve on and some things you can make just enough small enhancements to make a new version worth buying.  These are the later.",2,6.005711

I fiddled with this expensive product for half a day, wasting one sheet after another trying to imprint both sides on my HP OfficeJet Pro X451. I managed to get a couple of sheets printed without scratches and streaks. The other half dozen are in the trash. I selected the paper settings suggested on the instruction sheet. I tried the manual tray, feeding one at a time, as well as the standard tray because after 2 sheets, the printer would not feed anymore. I suspect it's because this paper stock has a slight bow after the first side is printed. I also tried printing the glossy side first, letting it dry and feeding it for the mailing side. Streaks on glossy side! Even on the ones that did print without mishaps, the non-glossy side looks decidedly dull.
One could easily blame the printer, but when I threw in the towel with Avery 8383 and bought Staples' own brand of matte postcards, there was no FEEDING problem, even though the paper thickness is fairly comparable. Yes, I gave up on pretty glossy cards. AND, the colors on the Staples cards look true on BOTH sides.
Of course inkjet printer manufacturers and paper manufacturers like Avery live on different planets. Avery simply does not bother with ANY indication of how many grams their stock is. Funny enough, Staples not only puts mils AND grams on their packaging, but also a list of printer settings for different printers inside for guidance. Somebody at Staples was thinking!
According to Avery's package, they offer a product guarantee. I shall invoke this guarantee and do what their CS girl overseas told me to do. It will take 4-6 weeks before Avery can figure out if they want to refund my money, but my curiosity is piqued at this point.

1 - They do not jam, bend or otherwise get messed up during the printing cycle.
2 - They peel easily from the sheet, but stick VERY firmly to glass.
3 - They are thick enough so that they can be applied to bottles smoothly with no wrinkles. This is a HUGE advantage over some other types of labels we have tried.
4 - The 5264 template is built in to most major software packages. Setting up the labels for printing was a breeze.

The negatives are: Haven't found any yet!

One reviewer mentioned that he had problems removing labels once they were applied to bottles. First, that's generally a good thing. The last thing I would want to happen is to have the labels just slide off after getting wet or being subjected to temperature changes. However I tried removing labels for the first time last week and didn't really find it all that hard. What I did was rinse the bottles with hot running water for a couple of minutes. I then places the bottles in a boiling water bath for 5 minutes. The labels peeled right off for the most part. In a couple of cases there was a bit of adhesive left on bottles, but that rubbed off easily enough while the bottle was still hot.

My wife actually then used a bit of an environmentally friendly degreaser on a bottle that was not boiled, and that seemed to remove the adhesive easily enough as well.

2326,"Ok its a descent printer. I wanted it for its air print feature so my ipad can print to it. None of the ipad apps work well so I wanted this, and it works flawlessly. I have four epson printers from this one to an artisan 710 and the Workforce series. It seems like all of them do one thing well leaving something lacking. The pain in the butt on this one is the paper feed trays are not only confusing, but are small. The printer won't print pictures to regular paper tray without some hokus pocus that I cant figure out. You must use the photo paper tray that has all these settings and guides you must align. The other epsons work easier but don't print quite as good a quality photos except the artisan is as good.

The touch screen is awesome. A must have feature. No more clicking through ten menues to get to where you need to be to change a setting.

One of the strangest features is extending print guide. Watch the video and you will see it. I like the printer, but it does have its flaws. I would not buy it again. It is such a departure in design and function from previous epsons. Its just odd.

Now comes the 8825 and the reception is fantastic.  After a couple of months of using the unit I've found a few problems with the system that are again making me think about getting rid of it.  The first is the speaker phone on the base, when I'm talking people on the other end can hear me just fine but I can't hear them worth a darn.  The sound is choppy and I thought maybe it was because Siemans put the speaker underneath the handset (very strange) but removing the handset and trying the speaker phone without the handset in the way didn't yield any better results.  A call to Siemens customer service didn't help, they told me to reset the base.  Also the volume on the base speaker phone just isn't enough.  My other complaint is when pushing the buttons on the base and the cordless handset their's that dreadful delay.  I use the a speakerphone alot and this may be the reason I get rid of the phone. One other strange problem is the absence of a flash button on the cordless handset. Siemens has you using the talk button to switch between the calls which I found not working right a good part of the time.  The base however does have a flash button and it works just fine in switching between calls.
On the good side the cordless handset is wonderful, good volume and even better volume using it's speaker phone.  Menu is well laid out and the display is easy to read.  The corded phone (except for the speaker phone) works well.

You'll get a good starter package that not only allows you to do most accounting functions, but also invoicing and project management.

From an invoicing standpoint, you will be good to go if basic invoicing is all you need.  You can add your logo, and adjust what billable tasks are included on your invoice.  If you need to do some customizations or have clients that require your invoices to be in a particular format, then you may need to dive deeper into what capabilities or limitations you'd face.

The interface is nice and modern.  The menus are easy to follow and for the most part everything loads pretty quick.  I have not tested every possible device, but they appear to be fairly cross-platform.  I did test account syncing, but it wasn't for me at this time.  I prefer the ""old and slow"" method, lol, but account syncing is an option for you.

The overall ease of use and installation, as well as a nice, clean user interface make Sage One a good product.  it looks like the project management features are starting to take shape as well.",4,6.084868

Most important: how does it write? Very smooth. No tuning, rubbing on rough paper or any of that. Feel on paper - fine, slightly wet flow that dries quickly, no smudging.
One of the few fountain pens I have whose nib does not dry out if unused for a week or two. Take off the cap and start writing after a week or more - perfect.
Second, the writing feel is great out of the box. Snap on the ink refill, wait a minute for the nib to draw the ink, and you are good to go.
Whats not to like? Its a bit bright for my personal taste, but that is a personal thing. One too many bright gold bands.

Perhaps if you were printing more than one copy the multiple copies would print faster. Or maybe when I get my higher-end computer. It seems to have to think for an incredibly long time before it begins to print. It sometimes locks up after it has been 'thinking' for about 4 minutes and I have to start the print job all over.  The color printouts once it does get around to printing are not the greatest quality. Must be ""draft."" I hesitate to think how long it would take if I tried the duplexing.

I've had the ink three months, and grown to quite like it. The best feature is it becomes nearly waterproof very quickly. Compared with some Waterman Black I have, which comes right off the page with a wet finger, the Salix ink barely smudge a bit with a wet finger, and remains eminently legible.

4.  Release power button (the screen should now say 'Service Mode').
5.  Wait until the power button lights steady green, then press the stop/reset button three times with a 3 sec space between each press.  On the 3rd press the indicator should turn steady orange.
6.  Press the power button once, (the orange light should go off).
7.  Open the printer and remove both cartridges.  Wait for 10 seconds.  Replace the cartridges and close printer.  Wait for 30 seconds.
8.  Press the power button, and wait until printer has shut down.

2358,"I've used Canon printers for years, and do a lot of photo 8.5"" x 11"" prints.  My paper of choice has been Canon's matte photo paper (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Canon-Matte-Photo-Paper-8-5-x-11-Inches-50-Sheets-7981A004/dp/B0000721Z3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Canon Matte Photo Paper, 8.5 x 11 Inches, 50 Sheets (7981A004)</a>), because it is fairly economical, and produces good results.  The matte paper does seem to absorb a lot of ink, so I decided to try Canon's glossy photo paper, which seemed to be getting rave reviews here at Amazon.

The results using my year old Canon iP4600 printer, and non-Canon ink cartridges are outstanding.  Colors look accurate, and are not too saturated, with the glossy finish being comparable to a real photograph.  The paper is thicker and stiffer than I expected it to be, which is a good thing as you don't have to be super careful, to avoid bending the print.  And the glossy surface of the print is not prone to picking up fingerprints, like a real photograph.

At somewhere in the 18 to 22 cent per print range, this paper is very affordable for those that make a lot of prints.  My impression is that ink consumption is something less, than for a similar print using matte paper.  If this is true, then that is another benefit.  How long the prints will last, is an important question I can't answer at this time.  Assuming prints are not exposed to direct sunlight or harsh lighting, hopefully they will not degrade or discolor for several years.

As an avid photographer who does fair amount of printing, I highly recommend this photo paper.  Canon's matte paper is great as well, and roughly the same cost.  Matte or glossy, Canon has my needs covered.",8,13.387654

2360,"I'd read a lot of reviews on a lot of printers before I finally decided to order the 785, and now I have to return the favor.  This is one amazing printer.  I've recently gotten back into photography, and that, coupled with an ongoing interest in digital art made me certain that whatever I bought, it would have to reproduce my work with more fidelity than my old Stylus Color 1520 (A great printer, but once the printhead died, it was time to move on.) Reviews by photographers were what finally swung me over to this model, and I can tell you that they are not exaggerating.  The results I've been getting from this printer are as good or better than I've been able to get from online photo places because the output is more customizable.  What I see on the screen is what I want on paper, and with the Epson and some patience, I get it.
I've heard people complaining about the noise, but I have to tell you that compared to my old printer, this one is so quiet, I could print all night long and never disturb the family.  The old Epson sometimes operated at Wake the Dead levels, particularly during head cleaning.
I've also heard people complain about ink usage.  Well, folks, all I can say is this: Printing like this is going to use up a lot of ink.  You don't get photo or near-photo quality without being liberal with your inks.  You just don't.  If you're going to begrudge every drop of ink, then maybe you shouldn't be trying to print photos to begin with.  Send your pics to a lab and don't make yourself crazy.  I will say, however, the ink reservoirs seem somewhat smaller than I'm used to, but as there are five inks in the space formerly occupied by three, I'm not surprised.  I could wish that Epson had thought to make the color cartridge larger overall, but in the end, you use the ink you use.
I don't know how this model will hold up over extended use; I hope it won't always be clogging, but I do plan to clean the heads regularly, and keep it in fairly constant use.  My 1520 did stand up to months of disuse, though in the end, I suspect that's what did it in.  I hope not to make the same mistakes with this printer.

2362,"The process is not as easy as they make it sound, but the ink works, and the Continuous Ink System is the only way to go.  There is a little inconvenience, but it is far preferable to paying $20 per cartridge and changing them frequently.  That being said, let's look at the ink refill kit.

First, it works. However, you will need some supplies before you start the process.
1.  Latex gloves, at least 6 pairs, preferably about 20 gloves.  I like the Liberty T2800W, from Amazon.
2.  A box of tissues.
3.  A nail or pipe cleaner.
4.  A side cutter or wire cutter to cut the tips.
5.  Maybe some plastic wrap, like Saran wrap.
6.  Newspaper, or an old towel.
7.  Waste basket with a disposable liner.

Set the CIS on newspaper or an old towel.
Put on a pair of latex gloves.
Unscrew the tip of the first bottle.
Cut the tip about 1/4"" from the top, maybe further if necessary.
Use the nail or pipe cleaner to pop the seal out of the plastic tip.  Set it aside.  If you lose it, you will need the plastic wrap.
Remove the stopper (not the air vent) from the CIS tank that matches the ink color.  You should start at one end, either yellow or black.
CAREFULLY squeeze the ink slowly into the tank.  Try not to let a bubble form, as it will overflow onto the tank.  (It will happen anyway; that's why you have a box of tissue.).
When the tank is full enough, turn the bottle upright, remove the plastic cap, put the seal back in the cap, and screw the cap down.  If you lose the seal, cover the top of the bottle with Saran Wrap and then screw the cap back on.
Wipe down the nozzle with a tissue and toss the tissue and your gloves into the waste basket.

Re-glove, so as not to cross-contaminate colors.
Repeat the process with the second color, third color, etc., replacing your gloves every time they get soiled.

Wipe down the CIS tank, especially the rubber feet, as ink will have run down the sides.  Toss the tissues regularly.

Let it all dry on the newspaper for a while, then wipe the tank to be sure there is no more ink on it.  Toss out the trash.

Good luck.",2,13.943296

A friend of mine purchased the Canon PIXMA MX922 about a month ago, so I have had the opportunity to use hers before purchasing one for myself.  One of the features that really appealed to me as we were looking for an All-in-One, was the high quality 9600x2400 dpi photo printing capabilities the Canon PIXMA MX922 has and the 5 individual ink tanks.  There are some printers that will stop printing if just one of the tanks go dry, but not the Canon PIXMA MX922.  Although it's likely that you will want to change out the empty cartridge, it's nice to know that you can still print documents if one of the color cartridges are empty.

The reason that I gave the Canon PIXMA MX922 four stars instead of five, is because the network setup sucks. Including my friends Canon PIXMA MX922, I have now setup two of these WiFi Network printers (and I am what you would call a networking Guru).  Connecting the printer to the network is a very simple process, whether wired or wireless.  However, finding the Canon PIXMA MX922 on the same network after it is connected is a near nightmare.  You will need a lot of patience to get through the network setup.

Most experienced computer users would attempt to install the printer without the included CD to avoid all the bloatware.  Don't do it!  You can save yourself some heartache right away by using the included disc.  Just check the box for the drivers only or download the latest drivers and software from Canon USA .  I know that I'm painting a cautious picture of the Canon PIXMA MX922, but I would rather see you go into this with your eyes wide open.

This seems to be a very good All-in-One WiFi Printer.  The feature that sealed it for me is the Direct Disc printing that the Canon PIXMA MX922 offers.  Even thought it took me a little while to figure out how to insert the disc tray, I am thoroughly impressed with how well the Canon PIXMA MX922 prints to a CD/DVD/Bluray.  I would encourage you to install the included software called My Image Garden for the purposes of disc printing.  If you have some software that you know will work well in printing to a disc, then skip this suggestion.

I did try out the feature to copy a disc from the scanning bed and I was very impressed.  After putting the disc to be copied on the scanning bed indiscriminately, the Canon PIXMA MX922 was somehow able to find it and make an exact replica of the disc to the waiting blank disc.  You must use printable discs (white) for this printer to be able to print anything to the disc tray.  Also, the disc tray can be found underneath and attached to the upper cassette.  Pull out the upper cassette, turn it over and slide off the disc tray.

The Canon PIXMA MX922 has a Cloud Printing feature that I use in conjunction with my Google account.  It allows me to print from anywhere (why, I'm not sure yet).  There is also a Google Application for Cloud printing too that works with the Canon PIXMA MX922.

All in all, I am very impressed with the features and quality that the Canon PIXMA MX922 produces.  Still, I caution you that you will need to set aside some extra time if you're going to be networking the Canon PIXMA MX922.  The WiFi network connection is a bonus to me because it's one less port that is taken up on my router.  Hope this helps you.

May 2017 UPDATE: I am on my second PIXMA MX922 now.  The first threw an error code saying: ""Type of print head in incorrect. Install correct print head"".  Turns out that there was a class action lawsuit for that.
The current printer is giving me an error code: 1403 (another computer is using the printer).  Although I am currently engaged with Canon on this issue, I don't hold a lot of hope in getting it rectified.  I have researched it quite a bit and found that this is also a common issue with Canon.

2386,"I am totally fascinated with these highlighters.  It is a complete puzzle to me that these highlighters are not available in any store in my area.  They are the best thing for my bookmarking needs.

Honestly, I bought them by accident.  After I placed an order of Pilot FriXion Light Erasable Highlighters (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002B55YCQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), I meant to remove the skilcraft item from my order.  I am so glad I did not.

It turned out that these Dry-Lighter Tapes works better that the other highlighter I ordered. The FriXion highlighters leave a trace of ink behind even after you erase it and you can only use their eraser.  With Skilcraft, when you delete the line it is, in most cases, like it was never there.  I say most cases because in one piece of paper a small trace of the color remain behind but it seems it was due to the type of eraser I used.  Normally I use non-abrasive erasers which have worked great with this item.  But that time I used a pencil-top eraser and that's when the slight trace was there.

As when you use correction tape, sometimes the tape line is a bit broken when transferred to the paper.  That is not a problem with me because with this tape my highlight, the highlight is still good and line is still straighter than when I use a highlighter pen.",3,7.9951396
2387,"Believe it or not, I looked at scores of clipboards. I didn't want a calculator, watch, or odomoter, nor a storage compartment, form feeder, or pen holder. Above all, I wanted a compact design.

For decades, I've used the classic design - brown pressboard with the arched silver clip at the top. That's fine for hanging on a nail, but the clip sticks 1-3"" above the top and stands at least 1/2"" wider than the rest of the clipboard, so doesn't fit nicely on shelf, in a bag, or even on a desk or lap.

So, here's a simple, frill-less clipboard - AND it's lightweight, with smart rubber corner grips for added friction on pages, a nice reinforced spring mechanism, and a raised point in front that acts both as the finger or thumb guide (to lift the clip) but is also the perfect size and location to slip on a pen, as if into a pocket.

2390,"Like many other reviewers, I think this is overpriced.  But having spent some time shopping for similarly designed desk podiums, this appears to be the only option (which is probably why they get away with charging so much). The price issue aside, I like this standing desk very much. I have a desk job and hate having to sit all day. It gives me back pain and butt soreness, and as we all know from recent studies, it's bad for your overall health. But I don't want to stand all day either. So I wanted something that would convert my office desk into a standing desk but also allow me to go back to sitting when I wanted. I needed something that was portable yet sturdy and would hold my keyboard, mouse, and monitor.  This little podium was incredibly easy to put together - probably took less than 5 minutes, and no tools were needed. Then I spent a couple of minutes with setting up my computer components on top of it. The little desk is very sturdy and holds my computer monitor just fine. My keyboard is old and a little big, so it crowds out my mouse pad a bit (see the photo), but the setup works well enough. In my particular office, it's a little cumbersome to rearrange the monitor and other components, so it wouldn't work for me to alternate the sitting and standing scenarios too frequently. I figured I would alternate every couple of hours or so. But on the first full day I had the standing desk set up, I didn't change it out. I had a couple of meetings to attend that involved sitting, so I got a couple of breaks. By quitting time, I was definitely tired of standing, but I have to say I felt great. No back pain, no gluteal soreness, all good. I noticed that when I stand and work, I can do some minor exercise movements to get a little muscle work and blood circulation.

I have a feeling this won't work well for someone who's short unless they buy a little foot podium. I'm 5'5"" and initially thought this podium was the perfect height, but then I realized I was wearing platform shoes that made me considerably taller (and I don't want to stand in girl shoes all day). When I took my shoes off, my elbows were down a little lower than what is recommended, but it didn't cause me any discomfort. My feet were killing me after about 30 minutes of standing barefooted, so I put on the walking shoes that I keep in the office (extra cushioning with memory foam), and that made all the difference.

Bottom line: it works perfectly as a convertible computer work station, and I feel so much better standing while I work, but I really do think it's overpriced.",2,7.6533284

Also, I'm not sure why people are complaining about the size of the desk for large monitors. I wish I could post a picture because I have a HUGE 24"" iMac with a standard Apple keyboard and mouse and this desk is EXACTLY the right size for it. The depth is fine (I have the monitor stand about 1/2"" from the back of the stand) and I could move it in or even back a little with no problem if I needed to. Here's what I suggest: measure the rectangle on your sitting desk where your keyboard, monitor, and mouse are and then see if the size of the standing desk would work for you.

2412,"The promotional sticker on this says ""easy-to-setup wireless networking"". I've heard that before and I've never found it to be true and this all-in-one was no exception. The primary issue is almost certainly going to be what OS you use. I've never found wireless set-up to work as well on a Mac as it does on Windows. The makers tend to write drivers with more of an eye toward where the biggest marketshare lies and that is with Windows. I could not get this to work wirelessly on my Mac, but could, eventually, convince it to function on the Windows side of things.

One of the things about printers is that they often suggest an initial set-up using a wired (USB) connection and then they never include a cable. This uses a fairly standard A to B cable and I had one lying around, but you may need to purchase one if you don't have one on hand. It's actually a bit tricky even finding where to plug the cable into the machine for a wired connection because you have to life up the scanning bed to find the connection hidden in the middle of the machine. You run the cable through the center and remove a little piece of plastic to allow it to snake through the machine. This is, arguably, more tidy and compact, but it is also setting up a rather fussy step for the user, especially if it is expected that most people will only use the cable for the ""easy"" set-up then operate without a wire.

Once you've slogged through the set-up (or just given up and decided to use the USB cable all of the time, as I did for my Mac), it's a pretty nice machine with serviceable inkjet quality. You can print directly from an SD card or camera if you want to forgo the PC side completely and it has a great interface for scanning and even OCR. I found the OCR to be unusually good at character recognition for a free piece of software included with a scanner (usually, they're useless). The scan quality is good for the average user. Printing photos to plain paper (photocopy paper) is a bit washed out, but not bad at all. Text printing is better and I think that someone who is looking to print letters or documents for school will be satisfied with the print quality. I would not, however, recommend this for business printing. I did not purchase special photo paper to print pictures onto, so I can't speak to the quality should you go the extra mile. One very cool feature is the built-in tray that allows you to print directly to DVD labels. This is a swift feature that not all consumer-level printers include that makes for much tidier labeling of media (and I have used this feature plenty). I also noted that the interface for Windows was more polished and user-friendly than that for the Mac.

I can also say that I did not use the fax function. I didn't really care about that feature and mainly wanted the scanner/printer combination. It's pretty rare to need to send a fax these days, but I will update this review when and if I ever take advantage of that function.

For the price point ($99.99 as of this writing), this is a very serviceable machine as long as you are not using a Macintosh and relying on the wireless nature of it. I'm not wedded to putting my machine in a closet or another room (especially since it makes no sense if you do a fair bit of scanning as I do), so this didn't matter much to me. If you're a Mac user and this is an issue for you, you may want to consider a model which ""plays"" more smoothly with all versions of Mac OS X. I'd have preferred to give this 3.5 stars rather than 4, but Amazon doesn't allow for such increments. Since it does work quite well with Windows, I opted to rate it more favorably. Had I only used it with a Mac, it would have gotten 3 stars.",10,7.2587957

It has a page separator included (I added the pendant). This notebook is so elegant and warm in the feeling and has a nice leather smell. It is refilable.

I've found several PAPER refills, also ADDED MATERIAL refills for ORGANIZATION and MONTHLY/DAILY/WEEKLY/YEARLY PLANNER refills. Most of Midori paper is satin finished, very soft to the touch and can be used with fountain pen. The carton-like paper 012 is soft too, yet sturdy and it feels strong.

This notebook had been produced by MIDORI. Now the company was bought by another impersonification of PRODUCT MARKETING and the quality went from low to NO quality when TRAVELERS NOTEBOOK. Not the same. The black notebook from TRAVELERS is a leather IMITATION The brown is leather, yet thinner, not holding the fold, and obnoxious MULTIPRINTING label completely style-less, not what is described in this page. YOU CAN SEE in the packaging.. the difference: one is MIDORI. GREAT 5*.
THE OTHER one is not.
Simple. Return it.
The passport versions.. I have never received MIDORI quality, no matter of the stamping. The Passport versions of MIdori don't hold the STANDARD of Midori. The leather will be thinner, the feel is inherent cheaper, the imprint of the rubber band in the leather will leave a clear indication whether you got a TRUE MIDORI.. or just a copy. No one is to blame about SAKURA DREAM sellers version, but the PRODUCING COMPANY who cheated the GLOBAL MARKET with keeping the same ASIN/ (barcode product descriptive ) yet CHANGED the quality.

2418,"First of all a great seller. Shipped early so I would receive before departing on a trip. Then followed up to make sure I received the printer. The printer is great.  Quality of print on the same cheap paper is very noticeable.  The ink usage is not showing after days of hard use which is a surprise as starter ink cartridges for another major brand is on the high side.  Setup is way too easy. A small brochure ... follow the directions and it is supporting the entire wired network in 15 minutes.  Changed to wireless later and that took all of 2 minutes.  Changed back to wired ... 30 seconds.  Have not set up as a dedicated fax even tho the directions are included with a phone cord.  Had no intentions as I use eFax which travels with me.
A major plus for me is in a matter of seconds you can change and register different paper in each tray.  Letterhead in one, plain paper in another, or 8x10 photo in one. Many options and combinations.  The plain paper photos come out better than from the other brand on photo paper.  On photo paper pictures are outstanding.  Speeds are great and it seems quieter than what it replaced which was a relatively new, dual tray printer costing about the same amount.
It scans double sided without intervention. I had 45 pages of double-sided paper to scan on. Placed it in the tray and it pulled page by page on, flipping each over to get the back side. Nice. I found time for another project.  Also, prints double-sided by flipping each page over. Faster than brand X.  Smaller footprint and less weight but better results. Great buy.",41,6.321487

2424,"This is our second color laser printer in the past two weeks, and after a week of use we feel this is a keeper. The previous printer we tried, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brother-HL-4040cdn-Color-Laser-Printer-with-Duplex-and-Networking/dp/B001KXEICW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brother HL-4040cdn Color Laser Printer with Duplex and Networking</a>, was a step better than this printer in nearly every respect, except color accuracy. But my wife had to have a printer that was highly accurate for her project and this little printer was able to meet her high expectations. The Brother just could not cut it with the color accuracy, despite all the advanced calibration steps we tried.

Let me admit that I was a bit apprehensive about getting this printer given the many negative early reviews. Thankfully, it seems HP has addressed the quality problems with the later releases of this printer since it has been receiving excellent reviews lately.

The print quality of this printer is astonishingly nice. HP is confident enough to let the printer print out a photo quality test page that has brilliant, vibrant colors, and amazing depth for a laser printer.

The build quality of this printer is good but perhaps a step below the substantially heavier Brother HL-4040cdn, which seems definitely capable of a higher duty cycle. This printer has a smaller footprint and feels more at home in a home-office as opposed to a business office. That said, in our first week of use we have had no technical issues with this printer whatsoever and, despite being slower and less robust than the Brother, it suits our needs just fine.

After networking it with our Linksys router and assigning it a fixed IP number, we found to our delight that most of the settings of the printer can be manipulated using a web browser after pointing the browser to the printer's IP number. The printer's built in webserver page displays information such as toner levels and estimated remaining prints and has a full menu system to allow you to change the settings.

Our only grouse with this printer is that the default color output for photos is a bit too dark, causing dull pictures. I browsed through HP's Support pages and found that the dark color issue was quite common, but I could not find a solution for the correct Print Density settings for this printer. So, after much testing, and lots of wasted paper, I came to the same conclusion as another reviewer that there was too much magenta, which tended to smear the subtle details.

My Color Adjustments:
Using the ""HP ToolboxFX"" program that is provided, or through the web interface, it is necessary to modify the ""Print Density"" settings under ""Device Settings"". I arrived at the following settings: cyan: 0, magenta: -2, yellow: -1 and black: 0. To keep things simple, I kept the values consistent accross all the print density attributes, i.e., contrasts, highlights, midtones and shadows, although each individual attribute should probably be further tweaked. To my eyes colors were true, with slight heaviness in magenta remaining.

It was also necessary to brighten the pictures themselves slightly, using a software tool such as Adobe Photoshop or Arcsoft Photoimpression. I simply used Photoimpression to bump up the brightness by 10% (or ""auto brighten"" by two levels).

Finally, when printing, I found it is also necessary to set the the color theme to Photo. I did try sRGB, Vivid and Photo (Adobe RGB 1998) color themes, but they all tended to push too much magenta. Only with the color theme set to Photo was I able to get true reds and vibrant, almost photo quality prints on 8.5 x 11 glossy photo paper.

Conclusion:
Since there is a relatively easy way to get around the dark color issue, I have no problem edorsing the HP CP1518ni as an excellent color laser printer for home use.",23,14.1899805

My old Lexmark printer just broke down. Time for a new machine.

I looked at several different replacements and went with this product. Thus far, I am pretty satisfied. For one thing, it was easy to get the printer up and running (not always the case!).

Second, it works smoothly. I like using wireless and it responds well in this mode.

Third, I do a lot of scanning. The old Lexmark was a bit unpredictable and not always as efficient as I would like. Also, it only did one page at a time and documents had to be placed in the bed and scanned page by page. This four in one can load a number of pages in one document and create one file. Terrific!

Fourth, it works in a pretty transparent style. A semi-incompetent like me can make sure that printing, copying, and scanning takes place to get the specific job done.

To this point, then, I am pretty satisfied with this product.",2,5.757856
2431,"It's amazing how so many reviewers give this electronic dictionary five stars. For the most part I agree. This is an easy to use electronic dictionary with a deep vocabulary database and a comfortable thumb keyboard. The dictionary itself is a good one not only because of its coverage but because it lists a word's most frequently used core meaning first, unlike the Franklin English dictionaries where definitions are listed in chronological order, from oldest to latest (how stupid is that!). So whenever you look up a word in this Sharp dictionary, you'll know which definitions are the most used ones. The included thesaurus is also pretty good and the grammar guide is fun to read.

Unlike my Franklin 11th edition speaking dictionary, which had a lousy keyboard, this Sharp has large-sized keys that have the right tactile feel to them. There are also dedicated page-down and page-up keys, a very good feature. On the down side, the placements of Enter and Esc are unconventional and stupid and take quite some time to get used to.

The multiple-line black and white LCD screen is sharp and you can view contents in one of two fonts and change the font size on teh fly via a dedicated Zoom key. (The Franklin, in contrast, requires a trip to the setup menu.) Unfortunately the LCD screen is not backlit (nor are the keys), making it impossible to use this in the dark when you, say, have a sudden craving for enlarging your vocabulary while lying in bed. Given that most paper dictionaries (and the Franklin electronic ones) suffer the same problem, and given that a dictionary is usually used as a companion to reading something else, this may not be a big problem. Still, I wish it had a backlight option.

Nicely, the Sharp uses just one AAA battery and has good battery life. The clamshell design protects the screen and keyboard and the size is small enough to carry in a pocket. The build quality stands in stark contrast with the Franklin 11th edition collegiate speaking dictionary: whereas the latter feels cheap and flimsy, the Sharp feels solid and well built. I really hate myself for wasting $90 on the Franklin before discovering a much better value in this model.

On the other hand, the Franklin model has lots of learning tools (like an SAT word list as well as the ability to make your own vocabulary list) and games but the Sharp PW-E550 doesn't have any. But given the Sharp cheaper than the Franklin I guess this is not a big deal.

The biggest difference between the two is this Sharp has pronunciation keys but no spoken pronunciation, whereas the Franklin speaking dictionary is the opposite: spoken only but no written keys. It would have been nice to get both in one dictionary, esp. for foreign words (how exactly do you make those damned French sounds??) I got tired of Franklin's synthesized speech quick so I don't miss not having it. When I travel to Hong Kong a few years ago I saw electronic dictionaries with natural speech (American accented, no less!) selling for a few dollars. I don't understand why nobody has one here. Maybe the market is just too small as native English speakers usually don't need or care for this feature. (Who cares about how the French pronounce their words? We have our own way of saying them!)

Ok, in short, whether you are a student or an adult or something in between, this Sharp makes a great reading companion. Too bad it cannot be be updated to include new words like ""blog"" -- but then, who really cares for these new words anyway?",64,14.648224
2432,"So first and foremost - this pencil line is not meant to be a replacement or alternative for the original Softcore Prismacolor pencils, instead it should work alongside them in your artistic arsenal.

These pencils are primarily for fine detail work. You can maintain a sharp point on these pencils much longer than an original Softcore Prismacolor pencil because the lead is harder. I love to draw lifelike drawings (eyes, lips, portraits, animals) and I feel like these pencils have really improved the quality of my work.

These pencils are very pigmented. After reading other buyers reviews, I really expected these pencils to be so hard that getting a vibrant color might be difficult, but that isn't the case. The pigmentation in these pencils is definitely on par with the original Softcore Prismacolor line.

The pencils are wax based, so they will actually blend. They don't blend as easily as the Softcore's (because the lead is harder). The pencils are available in 36 colors. I would recommend getting the 36 set first off. The colors that come with it are really all of the main colors that you find yourself using. Lot's of greens, blues, purples. I do wish there were a wider range of grays, but the  two or three it comes with will serve.

A few tips!

- this is SO important. If you're going to invest in high quality artist colored pencils, make sure you've got a good pencils sharpener. It will honestly make all the difference. You want a sharp point on your colored pencils at all times. This helps with maintaining an even texture. Think about the spotty texture you get with crayola crayons. It's because the tip is so blunt. If you want clean lines and even gradations, make sure your point is ALWAYS sharp! :)

- A cool tip I learned about is a blending technique. You can use 91% or 99% Isopropyl alcohol to help blend your layers of color. I've found that this method works best when you're working on paper that isn't completely smooth (like watercolor paper for instance). You just put a few drop of alochol onto a cotton swab and gently blend the areas of your choice, much like you would blend with a tortillion. Be careful to not apply too much pressure, because you can actually scrub your colors off the page!",16,14.571144

2438,"Having used the Livescribe smart pen a little under a  year, I graduated from the starter books which were 8.5"" X 11"" spiral bound into the bound smaller lined black journal that is 5.6"" x 8.5"" in size.  Both are 100 physical pages and have 198 surfaces to write on.  However I had wanted a smaller book.

PRESENTATION:
One thing that impressed me first with all the Livescribe products is the wonderful graphic design of everything from the packaging, the instructions and the books you must write on to make the pen work.  They are beautiful and well-crafted.  This book is no exception.  It had a finely finished black leather feel with a solid binding.  Inside the covers are the necessary smart pen targets and a start/end page to protect the lighter writing pages. On each page which are numbered are the pen controls.  You have a page string, to keep your place and an elastic strap to securely keep the book closed or open, as the case may be.

USAGE:
I've filled over half a book and I have had people comment on the classy book that I use. Once you get past the first few pages the book stays open nicely, even more so if you use the elastic.  I also find this smaller size makes it easy to carry along with my laptop to meetings.  The page string makes it easy to find where I left off.  I find the page numbers handy when referencing the book relative to the electronic copy.
The only negative, that I would state, is when you open this book you can't fold over one side like a spiral would let you, so it takes up twice the space.  However since it is a small book to start with this is only a minor issue.

All in all, this is a great product and the price is in line with books of this type that don't enable the smartpen.",10,13.424319

This printer easily meets that need.  The prints look great and in today's instantaneous society, I can have them NOW.  We all know printer companies make their money from the ink the printers need so I am a little wary of printing in great quantities, but with the quality of the prints I think I'll come out ahead versus the cost of photo processing.  I still feel it's necessary to keep my other printer online for everyday printing (like homework for the kids) so I can keep the ink in this one for photo printing.

2442,"To properly do this desk justice you really have to divide the review into two parts: function and value.

FUNCTION: (5/5) Fantastic. Portable and sets up/breaks down quickly. Fits well in a portfolio case (not included) that makes it fairly easy to transport. Highly adjustable. Sturdy. Plenty of room to work and it looks cool too. The thing to me that really sets this desk apart from others is that it's rock solid and sturdy enough to LEAN on. Leaning is a key part of the standing thing and most other conversion desks are too fragile to put your full weight on - not this one. You can lean on it all day. Functionally I really only have two (minor) complaints: 1) The top shelf isn't quite wide enough to fit two monitors, so you are limited to one, and 2) the stock desk slides around a bit - but a tiny investment in little rubber feet fixes this easily. Overall this desk would be 5-Stars all day if it weren't for one thing....

VALUE: (3/5) It's plywood and a few hinges. I have trouble understanding why it should cost what it does. While the desk does it's job well, I'd have trouble recommending it purely because of the cost. But if the cost doesn't scare you away it's a nice little desk for those that need something that can be moved easily.",2,7.1213913

All of those pens are made of some sort of plastic or resin and ALL of those pens feel much more substantial than the Pilot Prera.

You can get a Pilot Metropolitan pen for under Twenty Dollars and that pen feels truly solid!!!!!  Not so with the Prera.

So no, I don't want to have to power my unit up twice each time I wish to use it.  The only reason I did not give it one start instead of two is that it is heavy and appears to be a solid scale once you get power to it. But since there are serious issues with it and it obviously was not tested from the ultra-fast production line in China that never tests anything, 2 stars is it.

2450,"I was looking forward to this product, but it has some issues. First off, if you use a case for your phone, you may not be able to use the docking station without removing it. You can still use it to recharge your phone, but the USB hubs are in the front which can make cord storage messy. On the other hand, the USB hubs are great for thumb drives and Bluetooth adapters. This desk organiser has very sticky rubber  circles to keep it from sliding around. You will have to remove the protectors for these. These things have a very strong suction. I have lifted the organizer up and down a few times and it seems it only left some sticky residue before I took the protective covers off.

2459,"I love Pilot G-2 pens -- I've been using their black .07 pens for years.  So for art projects (like coloring books with intricate details) I figured these would be perfect.  They are G-2 pens, but in a range of gorgeous colors!  And for the most part, that's true.  I love the pens, the colors are bright and gorgeous, and they're great for coloring.

But . . . there are 5 black pens included in this set and 2 blue pens, meaning that you're really only getting 15 different colors (black, blue, navy, light aqua, light blue, turquoise, dark green, emerald, yellow green, pink, purple, dark red, red, orange, and brown).  This information is available in the product description, so it's definitely on me that I didn't notice it.  I really expected to get 20 different pens.  As it is, I find myself looking for an additional set to add a wider range of colors for my projects.

That said, these pens really are perfect for detail work and coloring in small spaces.  I have a set of much more expensive Prismacolor markers, but they are definitely not fine-tipped enough for intricate coloring.  These G-2s are fabulous.  I just wish there were more colors!

2470,I have  Canon MG 7120 printer I received as a gift.  I wanted to make sure it worked before invested too much in ink.  The set of replacement compatible cartridges were a good buy and seem to work fine.  The one problem was although they included 2 spare black cartridges the set did not come with a gray.  I had to go elsewhere to complete the set.,3,4.9964786
2471,"OK, first, everything that everyone else has critiqued about this printer is true. The cartridges have a small reservoir, and so you don't get many pages before you are out of ink again. The cartridges at most big-box stores are about $12 for color and $19 for black, as of March 2011.

I purchased mine when my old HP 825C gave up the ghost...after 7-years of heavy college printing, and many work-papers afterward...now THAT was truly a workhorse. SO, I first tried to find a used one, but no luck. Then I went looking for a new workhorse, only to find that everything was geared for 'photos'...well, I print 95% text, 5% photos...so photo capability is a non-draw for me, economy and durability to thousands of pages are - while avoiding the costs and space requirements for laser printers. The HP 1520 at first seemed to fit the bill. It is small, very portable, everything can pack inside it...and I've even used it in the car with a power inverter. The downside is the outstanding greed of HP to sell it with no black cartridge or USB cable! This thing sucks ink like a sailor on liberty does beer! I get about 85 pages of text per $18 black cartridge...and maybe 15 8x10 photos per color cartridge. There are no high-capacity color cartridges, but they are very prevalent so you can get them at any big-box or office store in town.

Also, this printer accepts 'remanufactured cartridges' quite well...so you can cut your costs quite a bit, if you can find a good cost provider for the remans.

Overall, an average entry-level printer with a hungry, expensive taste for ink. Yep, it is mechanically dependable if you keep it clean...and I have already printed a few thousand pages through mine. It is loud, slow, but decent resolution and quite good color management...it's just an ink-a-holic...if you're getting this for your child in school...better get them a loan to finance the ink expenses...but hey, what's new?",2,12.433482

2474,"I've owned many HP calculators in the past.  My first was an HP21 won in a high school engineering project (yes, I'm getting old).  The NiCd batteries won't hold much of a charge anymore, but that calculator is still working!  Well, the '5' key doesn't respond and one of the display segments doesn't light, but everything else is operational.  I took my HP21 apart once - built like a tank, gold plated glass epoxy PCB, nice connections everywhere, amazing.

When I went back to college I needed something to get me through engineering math, so I bought an HP34C, which could do numerical integration and solve for roots.  I really liked that calculator, but  after a couple of years the display started dropping segments, so I took it apart to see what was up.  Inside was the strangest and lamest construction I've ever seen in an electronic device.  The chips were held in a plastic frame, and the PC traces were printed on a plastic padded pillow of sorts.  The chips weren't soldered to the PC pillow, only pressed up against it for contact.  Well, the obvious gas tight issues ensued, and corrosion got the best of that calculator.  Haven't seen it around lately, not sure what I did with it.

Years later on the job (QC inspector) I bought an HP11C.  Very nice calculator, I loved the low power LCD and the landscape form factor of the case.  It dropped out of my pocket once in a while, and after maybe 3 years refused to turn on.  I took it apart but didn't see any obvious issues.  Sadly, into the trash it went.

I went back to college and initially bought an HP32SII, which I really liked, but it wasn't powerful enough for my engineering classes, so I bought an HP48S.  The introduction at that point of algebraic entry of formulas was kind of icky, but that calculator got me through 5 years of very intense math.  It wasn't nearly as easy to program as the earlier HPs, and the display response was rather slow, but it made up for it by doing complex numbers, matrices, and other things I needed then (and never need now on the job, go figure).  About a year or so out of college the HP48S refused to respond to the ON key.  I took it apart, but ended up destroying it in the process.  Wasn't too impressed with the construction, lots of twisted metal tabs and melted plastic posts holding things together, no real way of fixing it at all.  That one very reluctantly went into the trash.

At work I found another HP32SII that someone had spilled coffee on and abandoned.  I took it apart and found the same twisted metal tabs and melted plastic posts holding things together.  After I cleaned it up it and reassembled it it started working, but some of the outer keys wouldn't work without twisting the case.  Some padding between the case bottom and the guts fixed this, and that calculator served me well for 8 years or so.

A while back I found the HP50g on Amazon and ordered it.  Kept it more than a year, but never really warmed up to it or used it much.  Really just too algebraic for me, didn't like the buttons or the layout, and by that point I didn't really need the graphing.  The processor seemed slow - it was really a huge turn-off all around.  So I sold it used and started looking again.

By this point HP had released the HP35s, but the reviews scared me.  Then BOTH of my HP32SIIs started crapping out, and, out of desperation, I ordered the HP35s.  It is a significant step above the HP50g in terms of ""HP-calculator-goodness"" but has a long way to go.  The buttons feel close (no cigar) to the original HP buttons, but you can tell that the paint will wear off at some point.  The case is rather nice, but the zipper pulls are huge and clanky, and the zipper itself is a bit difficult to operate, so I seldom zip it closed.  Two lithium coin cells are OK, but I would prefer a single cell with better power management.  The processor in this thing feels very underpowered, maybe only 10x faster than my original HP21!  I guess the speed is adequate though.  The key layout is poorer than any other ""real"" (i.e. algebra-less) HP calculator I've owned, with many things I never use as the main function, and other things I use a lot either shifted or in a menu.  The number base conversion feels really tacked on and awkward, which is a total shame as I use this feature often.  The alphanumerics seem like an afterthought as well and very poorly integrated.

HP, if you're reading this, here is what I recommend:
1. Drop all algebraic stuff and go back to pure RPN.  The algebraic stuff just clutters up the keyboard with useless things I will never use.

2. Drop the pretty equation entry (more algebraic stuff).  Symbolic entry on functional stack machine makes zero sense.

3. Build them so they last, e.g. molded-into-the-key function labels, glass epoxy PWBs, real screws, no pressure-based connections, etc.

4. Ask the HP calculator using community what they would like in various calculators spread over a well defined tiering - I'm sure the users would be a gold mine in this regard.  Better do this soon, we are all aging out here.

There is a very loyal following out here just waiting for what you could do in the past, but for some reason you've lost it over the years.  You guys were the freaking calculator kings, no one could touch you with those early models.  We're not really asking for anything new, just what you used to be able to do.  Please, I'm begging you.

I'm kind of wondering if HP lost all the know-how on how to even make their old stuff, kind of like how the plans to the Saturn V booster were destroyed.  Look - ANYONE! - just replicate what HP used to do and you will have a huge market just waiting for you!  We all know it can be done, a bunch of smart guys did it like 30 years ago...",22,13.765872
2475,"Like the other reviewer, I wanted a phone with caller-ID, not a mini-computer.  The ""techie"" aspects of this model didn't interest me.  I chose this phone from the Vine program because I needed a new one for my kitchen that didn't have to plug into a phone line.  My line is in the middle of a wall right next to the fridge and the phone kept getting knocked to the floor.  So, this set-up with a satellite handset seemed perfect.  I put the main handset in the living room about twenty feet from the satellite handset in the kitchen and they work fine.  I was delighted to find that they even synchronize!  When I entered the time on the satellite handset, the main handset automatically synced.  Another cool feature was that you can name each handset.  This would be particularly nice if you have more than the two this base comes with.  I named mine, creatively enough, Kitchen and Main.  This is handy because if the phone ""walks off"" you know where it needs to go back to!

The display is very clear and the blue background easy to read.  The menus are organized and intuitive.  I had no trouble finding what I wanted and the system was quick to set up.  I like having multiple ringtones, and the alarm is a nice option even though we probably won't be using it.  The sound quality is excellent, and the button layout mimicks a cell phone rather than a traditional phone (hence the talk button being in the middle below the display).  The phones are sleek and unobtrusive.  I like that the secondary handset is small.  The phones themselves are lightweight and fit comfortably in my hand.  My only issue is that the buttons are a little close together and it's easy to mistype, but no more than many other phones.

This costs more than I paid for any other phone in my home, but I am considering buying additional handsets to replace those since this system is so well done.  There are enough gadgets for those interested in such things, and for those of us that just want a nice phone this qualifies.  I haven't used the free Google 411, but any FREE 411 is sure to be a nice addition. Overall, I recommend this to those looking to upgrade to a nice phone set for their home that will look good and meet all their needs.  Those on a budget can get a simple cordless phone for much less that will do the job, albeit not so stylishly.

UPDATE: I did purchase an extra handset, which now resides on our second story, and it works perfectly.  This set is worth the money and the ability to buy additional handsets is very convenient.",10,9.694021

First, I want to explain why I purchased from Speedy Inks. I have been trying to find a manufacturer that will provide more than one of each color for the exorbitant price of $250.00-$350.00. Secondly, I wanted the ink to represent full, solid, vivid, rich, and vibrant colors; and not colors that were hazy, or white/greyed out. I received the ink today (1/24/16) which was only a few days after purchasing. The cartridges fit perfectly, and without hiccups. When I began printing my school assignments (Ph. D student), I could not believe the difference in color! I immediately noticed the richness of the blues on the page. I had to tell a friend (through Google Hangouts for real time joy) how impressed I was, and how happy I am that I found this manufacturer. I cannot tell anyone about images. I tend to not want to print an image (other than of my grand children), because printing a photo usually eats ink like it's going out of style. I have to say that the richness of the blue on the paper is not even as blue as the OEM ink from Brother. I have never noticed it that rich. Thus, I will return to this review after using the ink for more than one day (Lol), and possibly after printing a photo (maybe).

I bought this particular kind of pencil top erasers because I honestly didn't think there was much difference in erasers and so I didn't put much thought into the quality and bought them. They were cheap and looked alright. I took the first one out of the package and it went on the top of my pencil just fine; however, when I tried to erase something, the eraser didn't want to stay on, just came off with the first try. I thought I had not put it on all the way so pressed it down again. This time, it stayed on and where the narrow part of the eraser gets larger there at the neck, it just broke off. I threw it away and got a second one out, and a third and a fourth and a fifth, etc. They all had the same problem; they would just bend and break off. Amazon has a great return policy and always stands by my purchases, but this time I just let it pass as they were too cheap to bother to return.

Although this is an inexpensive printer and is aimed at the business, rather than home photo, market, the image quality on photographic prints is quite good. (This was a good quick test print, a full-sized photo print. The 13x19"" print took a little over two minutes to print.) The darker tones were especially well-defined in the color photo printout. A quick test print of a large excel pivot table also looked good. For a smaller office, infrequently printing large images, this could be a good deal. It also collapses to a reasonably small footprint with the paper trays retracted.

The LD 250XL yielded about 400 pages and costs about $8. Using a high powered magnification lens, a comparison of the text produced by each cartridge was surprising. To my eye the LD 250XL ($8) was slightly sharper than the Canon cartridge ($23).

The cartridge has started to clog the pigment black print head nozzle significantly on a three year old Canon MX922. Unless I print at least every two to three days, the nozzle clogs, which requires deep cleaning at least one or two times. Once I had to deep clean four times to get a clean print. Unfortunately, deep cleaning on this printer uses an enormous amount of ink and as a result this cartridge is half gone after only less than 100 pages. In addition the printer's ink monitor indicates it has run out completely. I should add that the three LD color cartridges perform very well with no indications of clogging.

I can't be sure the cartridge is the problem because the printer is three years old and it's possible the print heads may be worn to the point of being easily clogged. I'm a little skeptical worn out print heads are to blame because only 1900-1950 pages have been printed since it was new. I'll clean the print heads manually and post the outcome after testing.

I knocked off a star because the packaging was sketchy. They were shipped in a padded envelope and two of the cartridge boxes were slightly crushed. No damage to the cartridges but a box with popcorn or air bags would have been more appropriate.

One last thing. These cartridges were easily recognized by the printer and they are chipped, which means the Canon software can monitor and manage ink levels. That's not the case with several replacement brands. Finally, they do have the red-light system that lights up when a cartridge runs out.

I bought another set for a Canon MG5420 and those cartridges are performing as well as the first set.

To summarize, the LD cartridges are approximately equal in page yield and quality when compared to the OEM Canon products and they are about 1/3 the cost.",15,14.643494
2491,"Well I dream about being able to write beautifully. And then I wake up and I see my terrible calligraphy lol.  These pens, if you hold them at the right angle, are even great for the beginningest of beginners.  I felt like I made a pretty letter on my first try almost.  It comes with a tiny little instruction pamphlet that has been more helpful to this beginner than the calligraphy books I have purchased. No kidding! (see picture!) The pamphlet has six different calligraphy styles for you to try- along with fun little examples. I really like that little book!  It also comes with both black and red coloring, as well as this little weird tube thing for cleaning out the tip.  it's a great little set for beginners! five stars for sure!

2497,"I've had this PDA for just over a year, obtaining it as an early birthday present in early April of 2006. In that time I have been nothing but inordinately frustrated with the defects inherent in this device.

Defect number one: Video Problems. According to specs, the Palm T/X is supposed to offer video playback. As a football coach, I have literally hundreds of hours of video. I've compressed these files with two different video compression tools, and they play back fine on both of my computers. However, once dragged through the Palm conduit for installation onto the T/X, sound is out of synch and video is choppy. In short; it does not perform as it is supposed to and advertised to.

Defect number two: Touch Screen Misalignment. The lower 1/4th inch of the screen does not align the pointer properly. This makes it impossible to write notes, or even to tap out messages using the keyboard, since no matter how carefully you place the stylus, the device records pressure slightly to the side. This makes note taking, document editing, and other routine PDA mechanics into an exercise in frustration. (Indeed, it defeats the purpose of even HAVING a palmtop computer.) Resetting the screen does nothing.

Defect number three: Palm's lack of support. After contacting them within six weeks of purchase regarding these problems, Palm's ""answer"" was for me to shell out shipping to send the device in for repair/replacement with no guarantee that they would not turn about and try to foist the problem back onto me as ""misuse"" of some form. (Or the old standby, ""We can't find a problem, sorry."")

Defect number four: Macintosh compatibility. With the Microsoft blunder called ""Vista,"" more and more people are switching to different operating systems. The Mac version of the Palm desktop is barely compatible with the operating system, and some blunders are absolutely inexcusable: color codes do not transfer between iCal and the Palm device, for example. Notes sometimes do not transfer clearly and are either garbled or strung together as one long note. The only thing that somewhat compensates for these screwups is the use of ""The Missing Synch"" to offer cross compatibility. Why third party software should be needed to connect the leading palmtop operating system with the number two desktop computer operating system is beyond my understanding, but it's an extra thirty bucks Mac users need to shell out to get the darn thing to work.

Defect number five: Network access. The T/X is billed as a laptop replacement, especially in the wireless computing area. With modern broadband connectivity everywhere, web developers are using more and more graphics and video, things that take time to download. The extremely S-L-O-W wireless network card in the Palm T/X means that it can take several minutes to even load a basic Amazon.com search page, or reference your email. It's both faster and more productive to tote the laptop instead, since the network interface is quicker and the typing generally moves faster than trying to get ""Grafitti 2"" to understand your handwriting.

My wife received a Dell Axim as a gift, and the more I played with it to set it up (also requiring Missing Synch, unfortunately, but seeming to work much better with the built in Macintosh applications.), the more I began to like it. Unless I can find a decent cell phone/PDA, my next palmtop computer will be a Dell Axim. Or possibly a notepad and paper, which would still be more productive than the Palm T/X that I stopped using out of frustration several months ago. $299 down the drain.",28,14.38261
2498,"This is actually a Yongsheng 052 (not a normal Wing Sung model).  But seriously, I cannot say enough about how smooth and wonderful this nib is to write with.  It's on par with some of the $100+ gold nibs I've seen, and lays down a fine but wet line.  Hooded nib means no inky fingers and a very tight spring-loaded click-seal on the cap means no issues with drying out.

As far as feel: this is a very narrow, short pen and the photos fully convey how much.  It's about the thickness of a pencil and very short -- even with the cap posted, it's still on the more petite side.  For me, this makes it a bit uncomfortable to use, but I have quite large hands and tend to prefer abnormally thick/heavy pens.  The weight of the brass does help balance out the size with a satisfying density.

For someone with small hands or who wants a compact pocket pen, this will be a dream come true.  As is, I keep finding excuses to use it thanks to the nib even though it's undersized for my mega-mitts.

Edit: note that I'm seeing some issues with the brass rapidly tarnishing and corroding -- suggestive of an issue with electrochemical reactions between metals in the pen, so subtracting a star for that.",3,6.977466
2499,"Beautifully engraved brass plate.  The plate we received was exactly as represented and well crafted.  Rossi provided quick confirmation of the receipt of our engraving instructions and engraved and shipped the plate immediately.  The engraving was perfectly centered both horizontally and  vertically and the finish on the brass surface was also perfect.  We could not be happier with the excellent service.

Rossi should get ""10-stars"" for their quality and promptness, and I'm a fairly ""critical"" buyer who is not happy with sloppy workmanship and poorly designed or manufactured products.

Update 11-2016.  We ordered another engraved nameplate from Rossi Engraving.  We have now purchased (2) engraved nameplates from Rossi Engraving through Amazon and both were made perfectly and look great.  Each was shipped promptly and was made exactly as we specified on the custom order.
We could not be happier with the quality of product and the service we have received from Rossi and certainly will be back the next time we need any engraved work.  It's wonderful to find a small company who treats their customers so well.
Thank you Rossi Engraving.

2501,"I've had this printer for over a year.  It replaced my 5 year old beloved Canon All-in-one printer.  I'm sad to say that this printer is the worst one I've ever owned.  It literally guzzles the ink! I had to print a 25 page black and white typed paper for college and it used 1/2 of a brand new cartridge for that one job! The ink cartridges are expensive and don't last long. When you put in a new ink cartridge, you have to align it and waste ink printing out a page to scan. I've owned many printers and none of them required you to ""align"" the cartridge. It's a pain to do this because when you run out of ink during a job, you just want to pop in the new cartridge and finish. With the ""aligning process"" I have to waste 10 or 15 minutes messing around with it.  This printer jams alot. There is something seriously wrong with the paper feeder.  Another annoying thing is that the HP software pops up all the time.

I've owned other HP printers and they were of decent quality.  I don't know if this is the worst printer that HP ever made or if all of their printers have these annoying features now. It appears that the quality of HP printers may have gone downhill. I'll be very wary of buying anything that HP makes in the future.

My printer is still functioning, but I'm shopping for a replacement anyway. I'm tired of the endless paper jams, expensive ink and constant pop-ups.",2,8.467616
2502,"I hate mail.  I hate papers.  I hate bills & anything else that needs to be filed & kept just in case.  The way I deal with these is a box - a big box/bin that I put everything in & once it's full I deal with sorting it all out & putting it in its proper place.  Well the past few years have been crazy busy - so that big box became 2.5 big bins - meaning I had a huge task of sorting it out finally & needed some sort of system to do it (instead of just the floor space - since then my dogs come running it & everything gets stepped on & moved around).  These were PERFECT for that - exactly what I needed to get everything sorted.  An affordable solution that easily fits letter sized papers AND folders (so if you already have papers in a folder or a something those will fit in here too).

Honestly I would prefer to say F it & just chuck it all - but I had a bad experience with my health insurance last year that would've cost me $2K had i not kept my medical bills, so I resist the urge to throw all of my potentially important papers away.

I can't speak to the actual drawer set these go with since I don't have that - but if you're just looking for a way to sort paperwork out - these are an affordable option to help with that.",7,5.443237

2504,"The confusing thing about Epson ink is that some printers will take multiple kinds of ink cartridges.  The Epson Stylus NX415 for instance will take black series 68, 69, or 88 ink (T068120, T069120, and T088120).  They'll all print the same quality, but how long they last and the price/page are dramatically different.

Pages per cartridge:
T068120: 370 pages
T069120: 245 pages
T088120: 170 pages

Prices per page based on current Amazon prices (including shipping)
T068120: 5.9 cents/page
T069120: 6.8 cents/page
T088120: 7.5 cents/page

So this cartridge is among the more expensive per page that Epson makes, and if your printer supports another cartridge you should probably buy that one.",78,10.412923
2505,The product is small for an office chair to roll back and forth on.  It is durable so far but I have only had  it for a couple months. I did like the fact that is did not come rolled up when delivered.  It was delivered flat.  Their video shows its rolled up which is not true.  My biggest issue is I keep accidentally kicking it with a bear foot and man does it hurt.  I'm not a clumsy person either.  It sticks up off the carpet enough to easily kick it. I bought my friend one and she is kicking hers as well.  I must kick it at least once a week.  I do work from home a lot.  If your foot slides underneath it be prepared for a nasty gash.  The spikes are very sharp and will easily penetrate you skin.  It should come with padding around the edges and it would be a much better product.,2,5.3422627

2507,It works as advertised and I really used it to shred a ton of paper.  Retired and ready to get rid of all kinds of papers.  Learned a few things during the process.  If used continuously for more than 15 minutes and it shuts down completely.  Wait it to cool down.  Best solution to avoid this is to take it easy.  Give it a break now and then.  It does handles staples.  But this is good only if you have less than six or seven pages stapled.  If more you have to take it apart any way to feed it  best to keep the sheet count to six or less depending on paper thickness.  Eight is true only for thin paper.  Very satisfactory safety features also.,2,5.772538
2508,"At intervals, I need additional desk space but my fold-up table often became a ""catch-all"" area. When I saw this wall desk, I saw it as the perfect solution and it is. The product looked just like the images online. Delivery was prompt and the product was in good condition. It arrives in one piece with the installation supplies. My installation was a little easier because the wall is log so simple nailing was all that was necessary. The product is heavy to balance alone and so assistance is needed to get the measurements accurate and level. Be careful when aligning it with an existing flat/desk area in a L shape. There is adequate storage for 3-4 folders (e.g., To-do, waiting for an anwser, follow-up. etc.). A few writing implements, a calculator and a pad complete the storage capacity. I'm satisfied with the product and the ability to close it keeps my work area and desk top in neat condition.",11,7.732119

2510,"The woman who runs the lamination machine at my school isn't the greatest at it. She often returns items with parts of the lamination bubbling up, or she cuts into the actual thing that was laminated when she is cutting off the extra lamination. There were a few times she laminated the sticky note with my name on it to the actual poster. So I got this. I wanted to be able to not have to go through her for my every lamination need that is larger than a standard piece of paper.

It works beautifully! At first, I was impressed at how quickly it heat up only to discover it took the lamination pocket and the paper through the machine without doing anything. I was pretty upset before I discovered there was a cool setting. I cant imagine what that would be used for, but it was good to know the machine wasn't broken.

It actually FIXED the messed up pieces I had laminated through the media center, which was incredibly nice. One poster was a little off track and it messed up the edges. I ran it through again and it smoothed out the edge and was more or less back to the way it needed to be. My old laminator had a tray that would help me line up whatever I wanted laminated prior to running it through. That was the only reason I deducted a star. Overall, a wonderful product!",6,5.4363317
2511,"This Groovv Terminal One is a rebranded Ingenico iCT220 terminal - a very highly rated single terminal setup. This means that YOU enter the amount on the terminal, then pass it over to your customer. This setup is fine for very low volume merchants. The terminal features Ethernet or PSTN (landline) operation, as well as a receipt printer, magstripe reader, NFC for Apple Pay, Android Wallet and other contactless cards, as well as a chip card reader.

Setup through Groovv is relatively simple, though not as straightforward as say Paypal or Square. Groovv is a product from Wells Fargo, so there is a lot more to the signup than you may be used to. Essentially, you are signing a standard merchant agreement. The price is pretty competitive; $14.95/month and 1.69%+$0.15  for most transactions. AMEX, rewards cards and business cards are a bit higher at 2.89%+$0.25.

Square charges a flat 2.75% on all swiped/chip/nfc transactions, so you'll really need to put together a spreadsheet with your average transaction value to determine whether this is the best option.

The Square NFC/Mag reader is $49.99, or $49.99+$99.99 if you want a full POS setup. The Groovv terminal is essentially free at the moment as they'll repay your purchase fee after $500 in transactions.

All in all, this is a really affordable way to get a REAL payment terminal, though there are definitely advantages to integrating in your POS system. Also, if you have a low number of transactions, Square can still be a better option as it provides a really cheap way to get an iPad based POS.

That said, Groovv also offers a POS solution, so once again - check that spreadsheet for the best provider for your transaction volume.",8,9.836224

They are large and colorful, printed on heavy-weight glossy paper. Perfect eye-catching decor for a party. The only drawback is that, if you are using them for a two-sided decor (hanging on a net between rooms, for instance), they do not fit back-to-back.

I am convinced that using matching brand-name products for a printer makes things work better.

One thing, be careful when you pull the protective tape off of these units because sometimes ink will pool there and can get on your clothes or fingers or desk top.  That's a bit of a problem, but I'd rather have them add more than ink to a cartridge.

2520,"I apologize for the length of this review. It is long because I believe this stool could be a vital tool for persons with some handicaps, and I want to provide honest information on the stool ""as is"", and also provide
workable ""fixes"" that I feel could help assure more safety and stability, etc.

I first saw this product a couple of years ago and decided to purchase it. The design is something I would have drawn myself as what I thought would be the perfect tool for me to use for washing dishes or preparing food. I have serious back problems and have to use support to walk more than a very short distance. I am also unable to stand upright (unsupported) for more than a very short period of time without experiencing severe back pain and/or muscle spasms. I did not want something to rest my entire weight on. Instead I wanted something that I could use to hold part of my weight while still bearing weight on my legs and feet.

My husband AND I both talked me out of the purchase because it was obvious from both the pictures and the price that the item was very, very ""light weight"". It appeared that it could suffer from various kinds of failures including the button not protruding out far enough (or the spring pushing it out through the height adjustment holes might not be strong enough) to keep the center stem from collapsing downward when weight was put on the seat. Also, the ""splaying out"" of the 3 tenuous legs"" seemed to make the bending of the frame a possibility which could cause someone to fall. Even if the welding holding the frame together was very good, considering the fact that the frame is thin tubing, I was not sure if that could also be a potential problem spot.

Recently it became absolute that I had to do something other than use the breakfast bar stool I had been using since its usually shaped seat was unbearable at times due to the sciatic pain in my buttocks. I again considered this stool, and instead went on a search for a ""better"" alternative. I spent hours considering other stools and finally purchased one with a ""tractor seat"", 5 castors, a foot rest, etc. It was well made and extremely stable. (http://www.amazon.com/Office-Star-ST205-Backless-Stool/dp/B00196NPUQ/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1330798852&sr=8-3) It was much more expensive, and it absolutely did not work out for me. The base did not allow it to get close enough against the cabinets for me to work on the counter tops or in the sink (AND, it did not roll much better than the ""Roll About Stool"" - comments on castors below). I was then absolutely convinced that the ""cheap"" stool was the design of choice.

Based on some of the reviews, as soon as the ""Roll About Stool"" was assembled I took nylon rope and laced it tightly around and around the three legs just above the bottom where the castors are installed (twisting the second and subsequent ""passes"" around the previous expanses of rope giving the appearance of one much thicker twisted rope), making it impossible for the frame to bend outward and collapse. The welding was just ""OK"", and my husband has promised to weld it better and weld the center stem in place at the height that I finally decide is best. I have chosen the height I want, and the spring behind the button is adequate, and the button protrudes out far enough that I trust it not to collapse, and that coupled with the way I tied it together, as far as I am concerned has really eliminated the actual need for any additional welding. Anyway, re-welding the joining points of the three legs will not keep the frame from bending, which I think the rope has addressed perfectly (if unattractively).

NOTE About the castors: Larger, better quality ones might have been a good idea if you plan to do a lot of rolling around the work area. On the other hand, if the casters rolled a lot better, with no locking provision, I think it would be very unsafe to use. Since I did not plan to roll around on the stool, but only wanted to be able to easily ""final position"" it at what ever ""work station"" at which I wanted to use it, I find the castor's rollability to be adequate. The only problem is that when I push back on the stool when I wish to stand up and go someplace else, it tends to fall over because I have some throw rugs in the kitchen and because the stool weighs virtually nothing!  I lessened the stool falling backwards by putting an old Velcro closing 2.5"" wrist exercise weight around the front leg so it is resting down by the castor (and I plan to add another one because I think it needs to be 4-5# to do the best job).",13,9.135527

-if you don't have a printer cable, purchase one with the printer; you'll need it to print, and it does NOT come with the product.
-Go to the Canon US site, search the printer name, and verify you have the updated driver (I was good to go, as is - I am using a MacBook Pro with Mavericks)
- Connect the printer to your Mac and open Print & Scan from System Preferences
- Click the + sign, the choose ""Default"" and select the LPB6000 in the list
- Click on ""Select Printer Software"" where it says ""Print Using""
- Select the LPB6000 from the list, then OK
- Click ""Add""

These are the directions you'll get from the CD.  I followed them step-by-step, and it worked flawlessly.  I printed several test pages without any problems.
Remember, this is NOT a WiFi printer; you must connect your Mac/PC to the printer to print.

This is perfect for my needs, hence the rating.  The printer is quIck and quiet, and at the price ($49), a great deal.",6,7.8543997

2528,"I loved the way the markers went onto the paper. They are smooth and vibrant as they are applied. However, several of the markers came damaged. The green one has a square tip rather than the tapered tip of the others which makes it difficult to use. Several other tips are frayed.

2530,"This eraser does not damage my paper but it is not good at erasing pencil. Instead it seems to spread the graphite so it leaves excessive smudges. I might then be able to erase the smudges but that is not what I had expected.
I prefer Prismacolor Magic rub which is probably a little less gentle but actually removes my pencil drawings right away.

In case this is relevant to anyone: I use good quality Bristol or mixed media paper. Because the paper I use is not thin and flimsy I don't know if this eraser would damage thin paper. I use graphite pencils, preferably Faber Castell, and I actually don't press very hard until I am very sure about my lines at which point I don't erase any more.

If you have never used this eraser before and you can get a good deal on one you might as well give it a try, for example if you see it in a local store where you don't have to pay shipping.",2,5.0429945
2531,"I ordered this last year and used it all throughout the school year, it was a great lanyard.  So, i ordered one again this school year and I already have to throw it away.

2532,"This 4-set of plastic folders is sturdy and designed to hold a substantial amount of paper.  The left side of the pocket is expandable and you could easily store a composition book or a workbook in this area.  The seams where the plastic pockets are connected have been reinforced so they appear to be able to withstand a substantial amount of abuse.

The adjustable gray flap is not all that practical.  It is used to keep papers secure by keeping the folder closed (or keeping the papers in the right side of the folder intact); however, I find that I have to really fiddle with it to close and open the tab (too much effort).  I prefer to simply tuck the tab into the inside folder and not use it.  In addition, the 3-layered pockets on the right hand side of the folders appear on the surface to be a nice option however they offer a fairly tight fit for papers.  If you're not careful when you insert your papers, they'll get stuck and the paper edges curl up (which drives a type ""A"" personality like me a little crazy).  Additionally, although you technically have 3-pockets, most people will be inserting the same sized paper (8-1/2 x 11"") into each pocket so your papers can be separated by the pockets but they will still be stacked in a pile (the illustration is a bit misleading - Who would ever have 3 different sized papers to fill the 3-pocket slots as pictured?).

If you are looking for plastic folders that hold a ton of paper (advertised 300 sheets - but that's going to be a tight fit) this is a good design.  There are less expensive plastic folders out there; however, they'll hold a lot less paper.  Overall, this is a good sturdy product.  The 3-hole punch also allows users to store the folders inside a 3-ring binder.  Noteworthy also is that once the left side of the folder is expanded - it wants to stay in this bulkier expanded form (not a complaint - merely an observation).",11,12.169738

I've used it over a dozen times already, and I can tell I won't need another for a long time. I would have paid more for something made this well. My ONLY complaint is that the measurement ticks on the sides are off by about a few millimeters. This won't matter to most, but I'm using it to staple small press comics to sell, and it matters quite a bit to me. So because I still have to eyeball where where to put the slider, and waste a staple or two or three making sure my staples are lined up properly, I have to knock off a star. It's unfortunate, because the ruler marks are embedded, it's even harder to make my own marks that are more accurate. Oh well. Otherwise it's awesome.",3,4.209788

I bought 2 of these and loved them when they got here and worked - one in Midwest home, other in Florida.  The Florida machine broke down in 13 months, in the middle of a print job, and NOTHING on it would work anymore - the scanner, the fax, NOTHING works when the ""Print Head Error"" appears.

2543,"If you're like me, you thought those reviews about setting up this printer were a bit exaggerated.  They're NOT.  This printer is a nightmare to set up, primarily because the instructions are tragically myopic.

Essentially, the instructions are useful if: 1) you're an employee at Brother and have been working there for at least a year or 2) you've already owned this printer for at least a year.  You're expected to know all of the technical nomenclature right out of the gate, without any definitions or explanations. (Heck, EVERYBODY knows what the acronym ""SSID"" means and what it refers to, right?)  After two installs and four hours of screaming, I finally got the printer to work, somewhat.

Here are some hints:  The software will NOT install properly unless your computer is connected to the printer.  If you're going to do a wireless connection, you can either spend two hours figuring out how to do that.  Or you can temporarily hook up a USB cable to the printer.  Having done the former, I suggest that you buy a USB cable and be prepared to do the latter.

If your computer is not connected to the printer by a cable or wirelessly, the software disk will spin and you will think that you've completed an install but you have not.  Trust me, you will be wasting your time looking for guidance in either the written user manual or the online user guide on the installation disk.  The written manual skips ALL of the important set up details.  Meanwhile, the online guide will lead you through a labyrinth of links that redundantly fail to give you any useful information.

Regarding the printer itself, my initial impression is that it may turn out to be a useful tool. IMHO, Brother skimped on the plastic paper tray, which is not as heavy duty as it should be and another reviewer has mentioned this.  But the touch screen looks quite professional.

Just know in advance that the other reviewers are telling you the god's honest truth.  Be prepared to waste a LOT of time figuring out how to set up this printer ON YOUR OWN WITHOUT ANY HELP WHATSOEVER.  Once you do all of the hard work, you can refer to the (practically useless) printed manual to tell you how to do everything that you already intuitively know how to do with a printer.

At one point I actually screamed out loud.  Really.  It's THAT bad. I'm an old geezer and this has to be, without a doubt, the WORST set of instructions I have ever read in my ENTIRE life.  The only thing worse was a set of instructions written in a foreign language with teeny tiny printing.  It's THAT bad.

In fact, I had it printing from a Windows 7 notebook and a MacBook Pro within ten minutes of taking it out of the box, and that was a surprise in itself.

The wireless connection was easy to set up, and once the unit was online and the paper was loaded, everything worked quite efficiently.  For those who want the quick facts, the good and the not so good, here they are.

 Pros:

+ Very solid all-in-one SOHO solution where space is at a premium.
+ Extremely fast setup with either Window 7 or Mac OS X
+ Connects via built-in wireless 802.11; USB 2.0; Ethernet 10/100 Base TX
+ Fast printing, over 20 pages per minute (ppm); verified
+ First print out in less than 10 seconds from ready
+ High-resolution black & white printing; about 1,200 x 1,200 dpi
+ Holds about 150 sheets standard 20 lb. letter paper
+ Prints on plain paper, envelopes, labels and other paper stock
+ Auto document feeder (ADF) holds up to 40 sheets
+ Fax modem speed at 33.6 Kbps (not verified)
+ Warranty: 12 months, parts & labor

 Cons:

- Built-in LCD display is a bit small at 16 x 2 line; can be hard to read

 Details & First Impressions:

The printer was packaged very well, and it only took a few minutes to unpack it from the carton and review the contents.  Its desktop footprint is very small; at 15.8"" wide and 11.5"" deep it takes up little more space than my Windows 7 notebook, and at 11.7"" high it's not very obtrusive at all.  It weighs less than 18 lbs., so it's easy to move.  There was no real user manual, but here's one available online for download from Samsung.  Besides the printer itself, is came with the following:

- CD software
- A quick installation guide
- A full network installation guide
- French display panel sticker
- An AC power cord
- A USB cord
- A phone cord (for fax)
- A warranty booklet

Did a brief overview of the basic setup, plugged in the power and the included USB cord (wireless would come later).  The instructions indicated to shake the toner cartridge, so I did. Paper loading was easy, and printing the first documents from a Word document in the Windows 7 notebook with embedded images and graphics was impressive, with clear and sharp details and good grey scaling.  Did the same with the MacBook Pro with equal results.

Tackled the wireless setup next, using the included manual.  All went fine, but it's suggested that you have the details of your own wireless network handy for reference.

 In Use:

This all-in-one printer, scanner, copier and fax system is perfect for the small office & home office (SOHO) environments, especially where space may be at a premium.  It's extremely quiet in it's operation, more so than any office printer that I've encountered, and one can actually make a phone call without leaving the room when it's printing.

Scanning was tried only on the Windows 7 notebook, and with the software installed it's quite simple once you learn the interface.  You just right click Smart Panel in the Windows task bar, select Scan Manager, select the printer you want to use, and then click Quick Scan.  Once the Quick Scan dialog appears, you set the Save Location, the File Name (default is the date and time the scan is performed), and the File Format, which will be the default file type for each consecutive scan. Your choices are TIFF, PDF, BMP, and JPG formats. After entering this info, click OK and then click Scan to scan the document to the PC.

Will admit that I did not use the fax feature on this all-in-one unit except for about two minutes as a test to confirm that it worked, and for the primary reason that I personally have very little (if any) use for it.  Scanning directly to email can be done, which is something that I find quite useful, as do the people with whom I correspond. It's nice to know that it's there if needs change in the future, but it's not something that I've done in years.

Copying documents is straightforward, and you can also prints multiple image copies from the original document onto a single page. The actual number of images is automatically determined by the size of original image and paper size.  Copy speed is the same as printing (about 15 to 21 ppm in letter format), and there are a number of different options that you can choose.  Just remember that your results will be in black & white.

The original toner cartridge is limited, so plan on getting one soon.  This seems to be an industry-wide practice now, somewhat irritating, but that's just the way it is, so please don't shoot the messenger.  A new cartridge should give you about 1,500 printouts, and the proper replacement toner cartridge for this unit is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Samsung-MLT-D101S-XAA-Toner-1-5K-Yield-ML-2165W-SCX-3405FW-SF-760P/dp/B006WARUYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samsung MLT-D101S/XAA Toner 1.5K Yield (ML-2165W, SCX-3405FW, SF-760P)</a>.  It can be ordered here on Amazon or probably picked up from your local office supply store.

 Update 11/12/2013:

I recently did some upgrades to my computers, taking my MacBook Pro to OS X 10.9 Mavericks and installing Windows 8.1 on a notebook PC. Expected to have to do some driver updates for this printer, but it wasn't necessary, as it was automatically detected by both new operating system upgrades, and both have functioned perfectly to date. Checking online, Samsung has updated some of the drivers/downloads in October/November 2013, so if you own this printer you may wish the check online for those.

 Update 1/22/2014:

Checking for the newest software updates at the Samsung support site, I discovered a note for the Samsung Mobile Print app. Going a bit further, found that it claimed to offer ""wireless printing, scanning and file transfers let you do more on the go."" This app requires Android Version 2.1 or later (Galaxy S, Galaxy Tab, etc.) or iOS Version 3.2 or later (iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad), and is compatible with Samsung network capable printers, such as this one. See the comments to my review here for further details, as this freebie is well worth it if you need mobile printing on the fly.

 Summary:

Color laser printers can be very expensive, as can be their toner cartridges.  This is a personal choice, but for color printing, especially when dealing with photos, I prefer using a separate photo-grade inkjet printer.  For document processing, a good monochrome (black & white) high-speed printer, especially if it's an all-in-one, is a far more economical and functional choice for daily needs.

When looking at this printer sitting next to me right now, the first thought is how compact it is, smaller than my old HP LaserJet 4L from years ago, yet far faster, much quieter and with far better ergonomics and controls.  The second thought is one that dominates: this all-in-one is very quiet.  It's one of the easiest printers that I've encountered to set up, and the results that I've been getting are surprisingly good.  It's compact, fast, efficient and quiet, which makes it ideal for any SOHO environment.  If you need an all-in-one and can forego color printing, this for the money, this&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Samsung-SCX-3405FW/dp/B006YCJZ3G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samsung SCX-3405FW</a>&nbsp;is an excellent choice, and is easily worthy of a 5-star recommendation.

2557,"At the time of writing this review, each notebook costs about $2.55, bundled in sets of 3. So why spend that much money, when you could get a memo pad for $0.75 at Wal-Mart? The answer is this: Moleskine produces the most consistent and convenient product for this size and type of notebook. The build quality is high, and the aesthetic is rustic and minimal. When you factor only price in, you miss the point of using a Moleskine.

Personally, I use this as my wallet and notepad. I keep my ID and credit cards in the back, and I use the pages for ideas, memos, or notes. The one I currently have in my pocket has held up for 15 months with a bit of tape to help it. I always get compliments and ""Ooh, that's cool"" comments when I take it out of my pocket. The Moleskine is not only a good notebook; it's basically a fashion or personality accessory in what it projects to others. If you're into writing, it's cool to have good supplies for it.

The Pros:
-The look and feel. New ones look serious. They have a cool shape, and the thread of the binding is a nice touch. Old ones look vintage.
-The size. The width and height are great dimensions for any pocket. And the thickness is easily bearable. When compared to my Galaxy smartphone, it is lighter and thinner, with only a few cm of excess around the sides.
-The flexibility. Since I keep this in my pocket, the flex helps it stay comfortable. The paper also makes it feel less sweaty than my cell phone.
-Page texture. I can write with any pen or pencil on the paper, and it feels great. From fountain pens to ballpoint pens, from regular #2 pencils to drawing leads.

The Cons:
-Ink bleeds through the pages. I use both sides anyway, but it may bother you if you like prisitine pages
-Cover sometimes needs tape to hold it together with heavy use.
-Perforated pages sometimes come loose at the tops and bottoms with heavy use.
-Cost. I could buy about 10 memo pads for the cost of 3 Moleskines.

Overall, this is a cool notebook. I use them a lot.

The mats it replaces, one was well over 15 years old (maybe 20) and the other is over 10 years old. The oldest was full of cracks, got my moneys worth there. The newer only has a few minor cracks, some hardly noticeable. It is one of the 'folding' type which I had serious doubts about where the 'flexible hinge' portion is. Well, there was no need for concern, that held up fine. Zero problems.

This went over a commercial carpet which has an integrated mat of a fiber material (not that cheap rubber like backing at falls apart after a few years). It is fairly firm. My first impression when I pulled out the rolled up mat was it's too stiff (opposite of another mat which was way too soft). I laid it down, placed the chairs on it and sat down for some time watching how it flexed where the caster were. It was some, but very little.  It seems as it will not be a problem over the years, but at this time I have no way of knowing.

 I'm giving this a four star based on the assumption it won't prematurely develop cracks due to its rather stiffer composition.",3,9.285168

Third, the ink cartridges on the fine point last a LONG time (I like that!). Fourthly and finally, I can SEE how much ink is left in the cartridge, so I know when I am getting low and will need a refill.

In addition, the gel ink flows smoothly without effort, is waterproof as soon as it is dry, and it dries fast, so seldom smears or smudges. And the pen comes in bright colors in this translucent model; neon pink, bright turquoise, and purple. If I put down my pen, everyone in the office knows it is mine and will make sure it finds its way back to me!

Colors for the ultra organizer.  12 colors, how could you go wrong.

Material: they are a plasticy material that is very durable.  They can be folded/bent, but not too bad.

Adhesive: runs about half the length. about 1"" of the approx 2"" length(3/8"" wide.  I have been able to re-apply several times.  No residue, continues to work.  Adhesive is strong enough to use as a page marker and pull by that alone...even a 100 pages.  Because of this, and the only potential negative pt, is that you will probably need to hold down the side you are pulling from to remove.  i.e. hold the paper near the flag end when removing from page....and also from the dispenser.  i.e. you will get a few flags if you don't first pull back the top flag, then remove.  Basically, removal is a two handed, or dexterous one handed effort.  Assuming this is not an issue...these are the best.

Writing: flags take pencil and ink.  Pencil will kinda smear if handled, and ink may take a small amount of time (depending on ink used), but the inks I typically use will not dry quickly on plastic, and this flag dry in just a few seconds with my ink....so for me, these work extremely well.

Scanning:  We use the scanner quite a bit (one feature we really wanted), and almost always the scans come out crooked; the guides don't seem to hold the paper in place while feeding the paper.  The wireless feature (wireless scanning to one of our 2 computers) is very handy, but if there is a paper jam (which happens often) the machine continues the scan, but upon returning to one's computer (not the Brother machine), the screen says, ""close cover"" and doesn't ""take"" the scan, one has to hit ""OK,"" go back to the Brother machine, and the scan has to be done over.  Also the steps to make a scan take forever -- one has to literally press 10 to 12 buttons for one scan -- then start again a few seconds later with the next document (the machine doesn't remember or default to the previous setting, it just zeroes out).  Copying:  The copier is incredibly slow; a one-page document takes over 10 seconds to print a copy, so of course longer documents take longer.  Print quality is quite good, including on the scanner.  It's handy that one machine does all these things (especially wirelessly).  Fax:  We don't use the fax function as we have an online fax provider.

USB ESC/POS COMMANDS but i have to find my correct programming language to use it (java/jscript/PHP) I don't know if I can Use VB on my custom pos system but if anyone knows me, i will figure out and will work...
Uses the RJ12(Phone Jack) plug for Cash Drawer and it's PIN2 if anyone is wondering and Secondary is PIN5
This one I didn't see the secondary plug in unless you use a splitter or what not, never seen a use for two cash drawers for one POS system but it's capable.

Great quality
Even the sample receipt paper comes taped and wrapped!

Ignore the paper instructions, it will take you for a ride just to see that all you do is put the paper in and be done with it.

These toners worked really well for a while - but now the print quality is really poor. I thought perhaps it was my printer but I tried my old HP toner (pretty much empty) cartridges and nearly* all of my issues went away.

This is really unfortunate as these were super affordable. They will work for basic doc printing, but not for anything you want to give to a client or use in a project that requires consistency. See pics for examples. Near-empty HP on Left, 3/4 full compatible on Right.

*I believe the issues that remained after testing my old cartridges were because they are old HP toner cartridges and sat unsealed and near-empty in a box for 6-8 months.

I am on a search for the best index cards available, and in the process tried these out. Note that these cards are unruled.

These cards are okay for fountain pens, but not great. There is some very slight feathering and absorption of the line of ink into the paper. My work involves exclusively fountain pens, and it is hard to find a card to accommodate them. This card will do fine, but I find Oxford/Esselte/Pendaflex cards much better--however they cost a lot more too.

The cards are also a bit flimsy. I couldn't find any info about whether or not they yellow with age, so I think they probably do.

They are not bad index cards, just not great. For the price, I would recommend them as economy index cards.

BB sent it to the factory; it could not be fixed.  They gave me a store credit for the full amount I'd paid for it.  I bought an Epson 845 on the advice of a friend.  It's a gem; the ink lasts a long long time and the scan to e-mail function works and I'm a happy camper.,8,7.3993144

2613,"Could this be the high volume yet reasonably priced answer my large family has been waiting for?  Answer: probably!  We'll have to keep cranking out homework assignments, papers and pictures for collages, but so far the printer performs admirably.  No setup or use headaches (you will likely get a little ink on your fingers during the initial fill, but that's minor).  No wireless setup issues.  I am actually looking forward to the day when the ink runs low so I can A) See how long it takes and B) spend less on ink refills than the several printers I've owned previously.  I like the business model of locking in brand/product loyalty with an upfront investment in a quality product rather than the eternal money grab with expensive ink refills.  As my family continues to tax this machine with various connection options (network, direct print, etc.) and we continue to churn through printed pages, I will have to update this review with any glaring positives or negatives.  For now - as an owner of probably a dozen previous printers - know that this is a quality machine that sets up easier than most and prints with great quality.  This isn't a photo printer, but pictures come out vivid and your day to day black and white is great.",2,7.64348

2615,"My Qualifications to Judge: Long-time user of Palm V; short time user of Sony Clie SJ-20
Positive Aspects of the Tungsten E:
Amazing screen; you can actually display color .jpgs on this PDA that rival the quality of a new SVGA monitor.  I find that utterly amazing.  You certainly wouldn't do that on an old Palm V, and the B&W Clie was pretty limited in this regard.
Great for Audible Books: I use the built-in MP3 player mainly for recorded books, as opposed to music.  I've listened to a few music tracks and thought they sounded nice, though I'm definitely not an expert on MP3 players.  It is great for audiobooks, however.  The sound quality is great and with a big enough SD card, you can fit several volumes.
PalmOS 5 is very nice.  The Clie had 4, which wasn't much of an improvement on OS 3
Performance.  The Tungsten E has the response time I was used to with the Palm V, even when accessing the memory card.  The Clie was unacceptably slow in this regard.
Software: The included Outlook conduit is the best I've seen yet; better than the Palm V version or the more recent Clie version.  Works every time and is very fast.
The Docs to Go includes Word, Excel and PowerPoint, which can be handy.  The Clie only included Word and Excel
Needs Improvement Aspects:
Boy I miss the docking station.  Included with the Palm V; an extra accessory for the Clie; TOTALLY NOT AVAILABLE for this Palm, and probably never will be.  The separate power and mini-usb would be very difficult to blend into a decent dock.  I made a sort of a dock in my wood shop; a place to hold the Tungsten and thread the cords out the back, but it is a far cry from a proper dock.
Covers.  Like some other reviewers, I found that the included flip cover scratched the top (where the logos are) of my Tungsten within 2 weeks.  The hard cover available from Palm has also been a bit of a disappointment.  The Palm rattles around a bit, so I had to add some insulation tape.
The finish.  Again, like some other reviewers, I fear that this shiny paint job is not going to age well.
Battery Status: I would love to have some idea how much battery life is left.
Pretty funny buying a high-tech gadget in 2004 and having to resort to foam tape and the wood shop to make the product fully functional.
Conclusion:  I would buy this product again; I don't think there is a better alternative in this price range.",31,14.60394
2616,"My headline wasn't hyperbole, or just me being cute. It's the truth. I DON'T do a lot of laminating. At least, not these days. However, when I do need to do some laminating I've found that the Fellowes Saturn 2 125 does a good job, and handles most of the jobs I'd need it to do, big or small.

The 12.5 inch size is great. It means I can use bigger sheets of paper if I need to, such as when I want to laminate a kid's construction paper masterpiece. But it also handles small documents like cards with ease. I had no problem feeding documents in and getting a quality laminated document out. I did get some bubbles on a couple things, but feeding through again took care of them. All in all, I was pleased with the operation.

The only negatives I've found are the weight (it's deceptively heavy for its size) and the time it takes to heat up. Sure, it's only five minutes, but when you only get the laminator out occasionally, waiting to have it heat up is a bit trying. Still, I understand that even the best ones are only a minute or two faster, so I accept that this is the limitation of this price point.

I give the Fellowes Saturn 2 125 Laminator a solid four stars, and I would recommend it for household or small office use. For a bigger office, you may want to bump up to one of the more expensive models, though.",3,6.264359
2617,"I love this particular Pelikan ink product, number 4001.

I use them in Rotring fountain pens and Rotring artist pens, and Pelikan fountain pens.

They blend well together to make rich colors.
I love experimenting with them in this way.

(Never blend inks from different manufacturers or different formulas when using in fountain pens, as it is possible the chemical reaction can turn the inks into a glue like substance that will damage, even destroy, your pen)

These inks work beautifully when drawn on dry calligraphy or watercolor paper, and then getting a light wash when using a wet watercolor brush to work the ink on the paper. I pull some of the ink, sometimes I add watercolor paint to the brush; well, there are endless ways to experiment with these inks and water and watercolor.

Just plain writing with these inks, on a nice calligraphy paper like Fabriano Medioevalis, is a pleasure.

The turquoise blue and the brilliant brown are my favorites.

But then I also love to mix them with other colors.

I prefer this Pelikan ink for washes more than any other inks I've tried. The reaction it has to water makes lovely effects.

You have to choose the amount of water to add to lines on paper, and then let go and see what it does.

I've been using this ink for many, many years.
The experimenting and playing with the inks and water never gets old.

I would definitely recommend these to artists, or artist/ink enthusiasts who use them in mixed media work, and also for fountain pen enthusiasts.",4,9.071766

2622,"I normally can keep a phone system for AT LEAST a year, especially given that when I do purchase, I research as much as possible to get the greatest 'bang for my buck'.  Panasonic used to be a name of reliability and quality and I would have naturally chosen it for those reasons, but not any more.  This phone system was purchased earlier this year, expanded by one, and ALL the phones are freaking out.  It's as if the rechargeable battery on all the phones (even the one purchased separately) have started going bad at the same time.  You pick up the phone to answer a call and all of a sudden the display starts flickering and then goes blank.  Then you run to the base to place it on, hoping that the instant recharge does the trick.  Sometimes it does, and sometimes it doesn't.  And this is on a phone that has all three bars showing!  So you miss a call, and have no idea why.  Rechargeable batteries for this phone are not cheap, and I purchased a set already, but to no avail.  The phone still flickers and shuts down.  Now that I am in the place that I have to buy another set, I am leaning towards an AT&T unit that has gotten good reviews, but in the past it would have been a no-brainer and Panasonic would have been my choice.  Also, this crappy phone is making me re-think whether or not I need some of it's features anyway, like the voice caller id:  anounces who's calling you from the base.  Not too good if you want your privacy.  EVERYONE in the house knows who's calling you, and sometimes that is not a good thing. I must say, however, that I like the shared phone book, so if I cue in the number from one phone to my stored phone list, it automatically updates all phones.  But I do not like the fact that you can't program the phones to say where they belong, i.e., den, kitchen, etc.  They are simply labeled:  1, 2, 3.  Also, the answering machine does not give you a count of how many messages you have, and is so sensitive, that it picks up hang ups.  Lastly, this may sound like something trivial, but if you have skin problems, the keypad is made where it touches your face when you use it.  I am CONSTANTLY disinfecting it because of makeup on the buttons. And now I am faced with spending another hundred or so dollars, because I can't return this set to Amazon, and Panasonic says, 'too bad'!  WOULD NEVER BUY THIS PHONE AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!",3,12.833263

By the way, La Blanche stamps are sold on Amazon (and no, I do not work for either company) if you are not familiar with this type of stamp you can view them here.

2628,"My review is more geared to those people interested in using these for drawing. I agree with those who find these to be extremely smooth. I have found the price of these not to be too far off from other pencil brands made and used for drawing. For example, I bought a pack of Derwent Graphics that were more than $2 per pencil and not near the smoothness of these pencils. Faber Castell 9000 are about the same price as the Blackwings when not on sale. Staedtlers are about half the price, and are decent but nearly as smooth.  Hi Uni is a little less expensive and on par in smoothness with the 602, Pearl, and Blackwing.

I use both the Hi Uni and Blackwings for my drawings. I started drawing with the Blackings, and use the 602 as a 2B, Pearl - 3B and Blackwing - 4B.  Later, I bought and used the Hi Uni's 2H, HB, 6B, and 10B. (I only recently became aware of the Palomino Mixed grade pencils, which I would like to try some time)  If I must use only one pencil for a sketch or drawing then I would likely choose the 602. If I'm given a choice of 2 it would be the 602 and the Blackwing. Note: I find that the Pearl is very close in blackness to the 602 and I have a hard time discerning the difference.

In the attached image, I used all three Blackwings: 602, Pearl, and Blackwing.

I must give props to the seller, Palomino. When I received my shipment, there were 2 pencils where the eraser ferrell was glued to the eraser bracket making the removal of the eraser nearly impossible. They responded immediately to my concern and promptly sent me replacements + 2 more for good measure. Now that's great service and I couldn't be happier. Thank you Palomino.",12,8.982697

2633,"This might be my all time favorite fountain pen. I have, in general,  found the Chinese pens to be crappy. Cheap materials,  horrid, stiff nibs, leaky converter.  Japan, of course,  makes some great pens. Parker and Pilot are just two Japanese - made brands. The heart of my collection is made by Lamy, which are cheap, reliable,  feature great converters,  and have great nibs. But unfortunately they are light as a feather and I love a hefty pen.

Weirdly, many of the low reviews of this outstanding pen mention the weight as a negative. Historically, weight has been treasured in fountain pens, one of the virtues metal pens had over quills. Criticizing a pen for its weight is like criticizing a diamond for its clarity. No, one of the best things about the pen is that it is delightfully heavy.

The nib - I prefer medium nibs - is an outstanding one, producing an exceptionally smooth, dense line. In fact, I have only one complaint: if you aren't careful in putting the converter in place it tends to leak.

Yes, it will take standard short cartridges,  but why use a fountain pen but not use the best ink? And most of the fun of a fountain pen is finding the perfect ink. Or inks. Right now I keep bouncing between Levenger dark green and Diamond very dark blue-gray (Forest and Twilight,  respectively).

I have managed to get a couple of very expensive pens due to drastic markdowns because of damaged packaging,  but I prefer this budget pen to any I've ever own. Without question the best pen under $20 in the world.

It was easy to install and the software hasn't caused any glitches with any other programs (the Dymo affected my MS Word).  It comes with a broader variety of templates, clip art, and symbols than the Dymo as well.

The main disadvantage for me is that the Dymo was compatible with the Palm OS.  You could print directly from the Palm Desktop using a Dymo icon.

My printer is about 5 years old and is well outside of warranty, so I had no concerns of that nature to consider.  At the low price point, I figured the worst that could happen is that it wouldn't work or be recognized by the printer, and if so, I wouldn't be out that much cash.  However, the cartridge is nearly an exact replica of the OEM product, although part of the cartridge is gray while the OEM is all black.  It installed just fine in my printer, and works great.

This Canon printer is better than the one I have upstairs and I really did need one for this computer too as it's a pain when hubby or my daughter wants to use the printer the same time I do.  Now they have their own.

The scanning capability is amazing on this printer and does an even better job at coping old postcards and photos giving them some much needed new life.  So easy to use it's almost fool proof.

I have used the copier and found it amazing as well with no complaints except that I wish it would do bigger projects but hey you can't have everything.  Copies can be done in color or black and white which is a nice option.

Printer ink cartridges are fantastic.  They are the large ones and you need not have to worry about running out of ink after a hundred pages or so.  This is one of the major things that drew me to the Canon since most of the other brands are now using the smaller cartridges.  I'm a happy camper here that's for sure.

Wifi hookup is easy sneezy and works wonderfully.  I don't use the fax part but I know sometime down the line I will have need of it and it will be there patiently waiting.

I like this one for it's capability to take the photo card from my camera whereas my other doesn't.  This makes things so much easier when downloading large amounts of photos like I do.

Overall, this is the best printer I could have found for the money with the best and easiest of capibilities.  Canon has been a long time company that has a high standard for what they sell and this is no exception.  I'll trust a tried and true before an unknown anyday.",2,6.198234

Initially I was so happy with this product that I decided to buy more and give them out to loyal customers. I found them to write very well, feel good in the hand, and the way the bit (black, red, or pencil) is chosen is so mysterious that I often hand the pen to people and ask them to try to figure out how to make it write in red.

Unfortunately, I was not as pleased with the second batch that I bought. I know they came from Asia and I suspect they might be knockoffs. Although they still write well and look and feel the same, I can't get the second batch to consistently bring out the bit that I want. I also have a problem with the pencil bit head coming loose in the pen housing and jamming things up. On one pen, the pencil lead just pours out when I try to advance it instead of advancing as it should. It also is very difficult to add lead once you run out.

I have never received a printer that the cables are all stored in a reusable HP zippered accessory bag and the printer is in a LARGE canvas tote bag with handles to slide out of the box with not tugging, pushing or using your feet.

The HP printer is a beauty in a sleek high black gloss finish.  It comes with power AC adapter plug, phone line, installation CD, quick reference book, HP photo paper samples  and two face plates (one English & one French).  It DOES NOT come with the USB cable.  This does not surprise me since most printers now-a-days do not include the USB cable.

After removing all the tape used to keep the printer intact during shipment, I plugged in the unit as instructed in the quick reference book.  Since I have a wireless home network, I was able to connect to my network using the WiFi  Protected Setup (WPS).  After verifying the network name and entering my paraphrase (password) it was online in seconds.  I then followed the ""animated"" instructions on the LCD screen on how to install the ink cartridges and paper.  There is a one time initial installation that the printer cycles through that takes about 7 minutes.  It downloaded updates, this is all happening without having to use my computer.  The printer spit out a test page showing that the printer head had been aligned/calibrated.

Now it was time to install the CD.  I am using it in a Windows 7 environment and the installation took about 8 minutes, so it is quite a large file.  I followed the easy steps to setup photo printing, fax number and registration and I was done.  The printer was ready to use.

I have many printers in my home since we have a large family with a total of 6 computers/laptops, but this is my first HP printer and I can honestly say this is by far the nicest, fastest and easiest to use printer I possess.  The colored printouts are beautiful in vivid colors, no smudges or lines.  It does only come with ""setup"" ink cartridges so I don't know how long they will actually last without being replaced.  The ink cartridges ""HP 564"" series are quite reasonably priced.  Depending on which cartridges you go with,  the HP564 yield approximately 250-300 pages while the HP 564XL series yield about 600-700. It takes a total of 5 ink cartridges - black, Photo black (item #CB322WN), cyan, magenta and yellow.

THIS IS A PHOTOSMART PRINTER (e-all-in-one) BUT IS NOT CONSIDERED A PHOTOSMART ""PLUS"" PRINTER.  This makes it confusing when searching for ink cartridges.

Besides the amazing features such as WiFi, embedded bluetooth, apps (which allows you to print from the web without PC), ePrint, and several slots for memory cards  (Memory Stick, MMD, CF and USB-removable drives, the thing I love the most is that it only takes one series of cartridge to print photos or documents!  It does require one black and one black ""photo"" cartridge but at least I don't have to be pulling out cartridges whenever I want to print photos.

The ePrint function is extremely easy to use.  All you need to do is have the printer connected to a home network and follow the onscreen LCD instructions.  The printer assigns you a unique email address.  Then go to the HP ePrint website to register and set up your security options.  You can set it up so anyone can send printing projects to your printer, or use just selected users.  You can send photos, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, reports and many other file types directly to your printer by emailing them from your smartphone.  I am using my Motorola Droid.  It's that easy.

**Currently the ePrint does not support MMS format (so no picture text messages). ePrint only works if you send an email using email clients such as Yahoo, AOL, Google, etc.  You would have to attach the picture to the email. Hopefully in time, there will be an update that allows pictures to be sent as MMS messages.

Since I am using my Yahoo email account to sign into the ePrint website, I get a confirmation email that the job was sent to my printer.  You can always check the status of your jobs on the HP ePrint website as well.  All print jobs will stay in the printer's memory (queue) for 24 hours.  This is a great feature since you never know if the printer might go offline when you are not home.

When I send projects to print from other computers (ie sending a report home from work), the project prints with no issues.  However, sometimes photo emails do not get processed and are stuck with a ""pending"" or ""failed"" status.  I believe these are due to some ""issues"" at HP's end since this technology is so new.  I think with time and new updates, these bugs will be fixed.  For the time being, HP recommends turning off and then restarting the printer to correct server connection issues/print jobs.  Also make sure files are less than 5MB in size, I get many failed print projects because they are larger in size.

For my iPad, I downloaded ""HP iPrint"" which is a free Wi-Fi application on my iPad.  Once I downloaded the application and installed it directly from the iPad, I was able to print pictures from my Photo albums directly to the HP C410 Printer without using the email option stated above.  There was no install procedure I had to do at the printer - my iPad automatically recognized the printer.  Make sure to check out HP's website to learn more about the different applications, bluetooth and WIFI printing options.

11/28/10 UPDATE:  Apple released an update to version iOS 4.2.  AirPrint makes it simple to print email, photos, web pages, and documents right from your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. There's no software to download, no drivers to install, and no cables to connect.  The HP C410a will automatically be showing as the listed printer to send your projects to.

I highly recommended using&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HP-Premium-Photo-Paper-glossy-100-sheets-4-x-6-inch-borderless/dp/B00066IK0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HP Premium Photo Paper, glossy (100 sheets, 4 x 6-inch borderless)</a>.

2642,I really love this particular Sharpie. I'll never know why they are so hard to find in stock in stores like Office Depot. This is the best pen Sharpie makes for fine line writing when permanence is required. The point is perfect for note taking outdoors where you are subject to poor weather conditions. Thank goodness Amazon carries these pens.,10,4.047996
2643,"These notebooks are wonderful.  If you like writing on a grid tablet, this is so much more convenient in book form.  You can easily tear out the pages along the perforated line so as to avoid having frayed edges if you need to.

2649,"Gorgeous, truly. But it is slightly evil and defiant. First of all, and I can overlook this, but I will  let you know about it nonetheless: The clip on the side is hanging on by a cheap metal mini-bolt. Danger Will Robinson, this always had me worrying when I clicked it to unlock and retract the lead. But that is not my main concern. The main point of discord here is that, for whatever reason, Pentel did not take proper care with this particular design in protecting the  lead. Of the twenty-something .5 mechanical pencils that I own, this one breaks the lead more often. Sigh. When you pay good money for a drafting/drawing/writing tool, you want it to work without hesitation.

When did this one break its lovely lead, you may ask? When I most needed it while taking notes from my dissertation committee. Nice let-down, sweet prince. I ended up using a borrowed cheapo roller-ball pen. Just cut my wrists right now. I ended up using a blue (God help me) ink roller-cheapo-ball point pen for taking some of the most important notes of my life because this cretin-pen failed me. Of course, I excused it surmising it was my nerves at the time, but noooooooooooooo. It continued with its arrogant outlook so I picked up another in its stead and have never looked back.",2,5.880562

2651,"A four by six foot Expo white board has been on the wall of my office for years. As easy as the white board is to use, I still miss the look of the old slate chalk boards. Of course, I do not miss the messiness of the chalk dust that used to get over everything. I had no idea that there were black dry erase boards. Now, I have one! I just received an Expo black board and neon marker combo. I love it.

The white board markers by Expo, e.g. the ones in this product package, work very well on my white board. However, I did test them on the black board. They are not at all visible on the black board. You have to use the neon markers on the black board.

Altogether, I am very happy with my new black board. Also, I still like the old white board, and the white board markers as long as you use them only on the white board.",3,6.1064878

2653,"I was looking for a new calculator to use at my desk at work and decided upon this one.  This is a solid calculator with a low profile that will help reduce hand strain. The buttons are hard plastic which I prefer over rubber buttons that some other calculators use. The hard plastic gives a solid feel, so you know when you push a button, it registered.  The display is tilted up toward the user at a slight angle but is not adjustable. However, he viewing angle of the display is good even when the calculator is several feet away.

The bottom of the calculator has two rubber feet to prevent the calculator from moving on the desk. The bottom edges are curved which feels comfortable if you are holding the calculator in your hand while using it.

I experimented with the currency exchange mode and it works, but I will not use it often. I do like the tax rate feature which will come in handy for calculating sales tax.

The calculator does come with some very basic instructions, but this is not a problem since this is a fairly simple calculator to use.

The calculator switches from solar power to battery power without any indication. This is good since your data will never be lost. It is easy to change the battery by removing two phillips head screws from the back of the calculator.

I will be using this calculator dozens of times a day at the office and feel that it is a great value. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a small desktop calculator.  Very pleased with this purchase!",2,8.167972

Beforehand, I'd been practicing at home with these, color coding all sorts of things on the board like search algorithms, sorting algorithms, OO design problems, etc.  These glide nicely, don't dry out easily, are very very ergonomic (no more giant Expo marker between my fingers!), and have great contrast with white.  They write more like a gel pen than normal whiteboard markers, and smear a little worse too, but that's fine.  Anyway, they performed great, and I think the interviewers were A) impressed I brought my own markers, and B) impressed with the different colors I used for different tasks.  I received a job offer, and I attribute a bit of that to these markers.  Get them!",8,6.043857

This toner costs almost one third the price of official Dell toner for Dell 1600n Multi-Function Laser Printer, which is rated at 5000 pages, but I don't think I ever got 5000 pages.

I have this toner for a month and have not noticed any difference in quality from the official Dell toner. So far I have already printed about 2500 pages and it is still going strong.

I plugged in a 3 handset cordless phone. Magicringforever prevents a call from going to magic jack voice mail. I use Google voice to ring the Magic jack line and my cell phone. If I don't pick up either line the Google voice mail picks up and saves the message there. The thin client uses about 20 watts and has no moving parts. It sits in my basement and runs 24/7.
Call quality has been no problem for me. The price is cheap, even figuring in the thin client. Magic jack works for me and I am glad I tried it. I know there are a lot of negative reviews here, but the bottom line is if it works for you, it is a very good deal.",2,6.124129

You may want to lightly color the area you plan to use these on with colored pencils to be sure you are happy with your choice of colors.  There is no changing the color once you have applied it.

2669,"At about $2 each, they are expensive.  But if you haven't tried a Palomino already, they're worth a try--and IMO, the Pearl is the best of the series.

The Blackwing line In order from lightest to darkest is: 602, Pearl, Traditional.  And I've found that the Pearl is the best compromise.  It's the perfect mix of tip strength and dark lines.  If you've read the hype, you might have heard that you get darker lines with less pressure with Blackwing pencils.  Indeed, versus a regular $0.20 HB pencil, the writing experience is a night and day difference.  You can write faster and with much less effort--almost as if you were using a rollerball pen.  Is it worth 10x the price?  Probably not.  But if you've read this far, you're probably the kind of person who could appreciate the improvement in quality--irrespective of price.

I replaced the erasers with Palomino's green replacements, which I think look great against the gold and white.  But the stock black ones look sleek too.  Unfortunately, neither is very good at actually erasing--you should get a dedicated eraser for that.  But the flat shape keeps the pencil from rolling (more-important than you'd expect) and also gives it that characteristic look that is always a conversation starter--especially in today's high-tech world.

2675,"I purchased this unit to replace a Targus PAUM30 remote control with laser pointer. The Targus was aways frustrating for me. Erratic button operation (no advance or multiple advances), illogical button layout, large size. The Logitech is a superb replacement.

Forget the dimensions in the on-line product description - it is NOT 8+ inches long by 6+ inches wide. It fits comfortably in my hand.

The buttons are logically laid out and very responsive. The laser pointer has well over a 40' range - I have no idea how much further it goes - just that it is still clear and well defined at that range. The advance/reverse buttons also work at about 40' with several intervening walls (done as a test...).

The on-off switch and the battery meter are great conveniences to avoid battery drain and to know when the batteries are getting low.

The timer is easily set albeit only in 5 minute increments. I find at least two uses. To time my own presentation and keep me on track. The quiet vibration warnings at 5 minutes and 2 minutes are helpful. The timer even has a 4-segment bar display that divides your entered time by 4 and reduces by one segment for each quarter of your total time. Another use for trainers: Say you give a group 5, 10, etc. minutes to do something. Set the built-in timer and you'll know when the time is up.

Want a gripe? Packaging. Their plastic bubble package took sharp scissors and some care to get open. That's about the only gripe I can offer.

One caveat: As others have noted and as Logitech is clear about. This unit does not serve as a mouse. I PREFER this since it is one less mode to erroneously get into and mess up my presentation. But, if you need a combined remote mouse and presentation controller, look elsewhere. If you need a great remote presentation controller, this is the unit.",7,7.6835256

The quality problems are so persistent and grievous that I can't imagine using this for business.  I use it primarily to print worksheets for my two kids, and UPS return labels.  Every time I try to use it for something where quality matters, it disappoints.

If this was truly low-initial-cost printer (40 dollar job), then I would accept getting what I paid for.  While this is still an inexpensive printer, the ink costs add up quickly and I will have to consider dumping this since it cannot print anything decently and is too costly to print casually.

Note: The printer will not print black if I select black-only if even one color cartridge is reported empty.  I'm disappointed that the Epson is deliberately set up to stop printing black just because a color cartridge is out and did not allow a workaround to print black only. Shame.

I've found the scanner produces poor image quality.  I would like to scan my children's artwork on paper, but I get better results taking a picture of it with a camera.  I suppose the scanner function works adequately if you're just using it to replace fax.

Printing can be good quality if the right ""inkjet"" paper is used so it doesn't bleed too much.  I think this is the first inkjet I've had where I won't regret having it instead of a laser printer, but I also wouldn't replace the lasers at the office with anything like this.  It's definitely a home, personal or small office, low-productivity printer, and it has limited page sizes.  Personally, the thing I miss the most is double-sided 11x17, but admittedly that is another category/price-range.

I have done some photo prints on this, which I would not plan to do regularly.  This is not a photo printer.  I used photo paper to print some proof-of-concepts for an offset print project.  The print quality was quite good, but the printer left roller marks with many tiny pin prick dents on the paper.  There may be an adjustment for this, but it's not worth it to me to figure out.  It was awkward enough just changing paper sizes and orientation with the poor user interface.  For photo printing, I still prefer a laser-exposure mini-lab type system (Fuji Frontier etc.) - In other words, I send it out to a service.

I frequently have alignment problems with the printer.  I get places on the page where the image is shifted left or right.  I've run the print head alignment utility several times but it still has alignment problems on occasion.",6,11.796334
2678,"Magic Jack is wonderful to use as a second phone service, not the primary. I give it five stars, despite the hassles.

*Everybody needs a primary service that is online all the time 24-7.
*Almost everybody needs a second service to save money galore. MJ  is a great choice because it is $20 for all the long distance you can eat in a year.

MH cannot be your primary service because: You need to unplug MJ when you boot up the computer (to save boot up time). And also when you are using broadband services (Netflix online movies for example). And because it is off the hook  when you close down your PC. MJ's voice mail will let you listen later to catch up with all you missed. And of course broadband speed and quality rises and falls with the phases of the moon which provides a bit of interesting drama to your long distance communications.

Primary: cellphone seems a very good choice. Here is the main 911 link.
Secondary: MJ is an obvious solution if you have broadband.

2679,"I had hoped to use this as an inconspicuous car/transport lock box for my Sig 920RS. It's close, so very close, but it just doesn't fit. It will hold my ancient J-frame revolver, which I don't routinely carry. Still, it's good to have a box on hand for it, and in the meantime, I'm sure I'll find other, occasional uses for it. From a distance, the silver plastic dimple pattern on the lid makes it look like a large bluetooth speaker. Up close, it looks like a Barbie or Polly Pocket case. No one would see it and think, ""Wow, that must hold something important or valuable"". It's a little bit flimsy, but It's inexpensive and with the diversionary aspect of its toy-like appearance, I think it offers more security than you're paying for. The design is well thought-out. The cable lock tucks into a groove around the sides of the case, virtually disappearing when not in use. The cable quickly and easily deploys to lock around a stationary object, or it can be used like a handle to carry the box like a purse or small tote. I appreciate having a 4-digit combination, which is more secure than the standard 3-digit. Like any other portable safe, a determined thief with ample time would probably be able to break in, but I can't see anyone wasting time trying to compromise something that looks like it belongs to an 8 year old girl. That's not a complaint; being easily overlooked is like security bonus points. I have, use, and enjoy a boatload of breast cancer awareness pink stuff, so it's not just the color making me think it looks like a toy, though I think it plays a part. The grey and white probably look less toy-like than the Barbie pink.  It's cute, and has a unique style and and I consider it a good value. If I found myself in need of another portable safe of this size, I wouldn't hesitate to buy a second one.",26,8.092854

2684,"We purchased a C4230 base unit plus three C4230HS handset units for my parents in their 80's.  They were having trouble seeing their phones, hearing, and we were having trouble hearing them.  This is a fantastic system -- when it works.  Unfortunately, after 6+ months of troublesome resets (taking out batteries and constantly rebooting) we're pretty much ready to throw it all in the trash (over $500 wasted!).  Technical support has never been able to solve the problems that keep arising, but the handsets keep losing signal from their bases.  Whenever this happens, the batteries must be removed... including from the base unit handset AND answering machine.  It's a royal pain -- especially for someone in their 80's who just want simplicity.  I feel so bad having ever put this whole system in my parents home now.  Would not recommend buying until you read consistent reviews that these glitches have been resolved.

UPDATE Feb 2010: Clarity replaced the base unit and handset.  It works even worse than the first one!  The handset is routinely losing ""registration"" with the base... forcing you to remove and replace the batteries, and then reregister the handset.  So after more than a year of struggling to try to make this work reliably, we're tossing over $350 worth of phones. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!",19,8.191935

2687,"The footprint of this device is rather large so don't expect it to be a desktop unit.  Fortunately, it's wireless capabilities let you place it in a convenient and unobtrusive spot where your entire network can access it, including smartphones and tablets with the PROPER APP installed.

Setup was fairly straight forward once you download the proper drivers.  I'm not sure why it comes with a software install disk if you're going to have to go online and update drivers anyway, seems redundant to me and adding yet one more desktop icon I don't need (and yes, I know it's easy to get rid of).  While you don't need to do this step, I strongly recommend going into your router settings and assigning this device's MAC address a permanent address on your network and then manually configure your printer settings on each device to always use the assigned IP address for the printer.  Yes, it takes a few more steps but I deliberately brought down my network a couple of times and when bringing devices back online, my MAC failed to find the printer both times until I assigned the permanent IP.

The printer gives you the option of 600 or 1200dpi resolution and most should set it to 600dpi to conserve toner.  You're not going to get photo quality color out of this printer anyway, no sense in using up more toner than you need.  If you really want to print photos, a photo ink jet printer will give you much better results or take your photos on a flash drive to WalMart and really save on printing costs.

Print speed appears to be very close to the claimed 14ppm.  The initial sheet, as on most printers today, has to wait to ""wake up"" the printer before printing and so takes longer than the rest.  However, once printing, it cranks out color and B&W at about the same speed.

Replacement toner cartridges are, of course, expensive if you go with Canon, that's why they basically give away the printer these days.  There are generics available, don't know if they work well or not although my experience has been they do not last as long as OEM and often cause other issues.  Oh, they also void the warranty.

If I was recommending a printer to someone, I would probably tell them to step up to the multi-function version of this printer with all in one capabilities.  It produces, based on reviews, the same quality output as this one and eliminates the need for additional peripherals for faxing, scanning, etc (and the scanner function on Canon all-in-ones is exceptional!).

So why did it lose one star?  Duplexing.  It does not duplex and in today's world of inexpensive printers, that is a serious shortfall.  Even my little inexpensive Brother laser does a superb job of duplexing automatically, no reason why that feature could not have been built into this for very little additional expense.

Someone asked me if this printer would be a good business machine and I replied that for a small business it might but that for a large organization, I suspect the per copy costs would be far too high.  It has the typical well built Canon quality feel to it so I don't think durability would be the issue, purely costs.",6,11.3975525

2692,"Who would ever write a review about the common rubber band?  An office supply geek?  A postal worker who is sick of seeing them?  Someone with too little to occupy their lives?  I don't know but in my case, it's because I don't use them as rubber bands but rather the bands to attach removable high wings on radio controlled aircraft trainers.

These trainer type aircraft come with wings which are held on by elastic or rubber bands so that they are easy to remove and perhaps a bit more ""flexible"" in a crash.  Now, since they are holding on the actual wing, things like strength, durability, flexibility are all important as you really don't want to lose your wing while in flight.  Not only do these meet the necessary criteria better than anything I've tried, they are also a nice and bright fluorescent orange color.

Why is color important?  Well, sometimes things come off a model airplane while it is in flight.  Sometimes it's important things like propellers and you will know immediately that something has gone drastically wrong, even as you run to order repair parts for your airplane.  However, sometimes it is one of these rubber bands breaking loose (you use more than one per side for this reason) but all you can see with you plane 200 feet in the air is ""something"" falling out of the sky that shouldn't be.  Well, with the bright orange, it's fairly easy to identify the falling object as a broken rubber band and thus no need to panic (unless you didn't double strap in which case you too are running to order repair parts and perhaps reconsidering the amount of adult beverages you consume on a regular basis).

So yes, it's a dumb little rubber band that we all take for granted BUT, if you're going to buy rubber bands for whatever reason, you might as well buy the best on the market and get them in a really cool color.  Hey, the color will make it easy to identify the nefarious rubber band thieves that inhabit every office and you'll be able to bring the office supply police down on them.  And if you are dumb enough to waste 100's of dollars crashing radio controlled aircraft (like me), you'll appreciate these particular bands.  If you have other uses for them which cannot be discussed on a family friendly site like Amazon, please keep them to yourself and consider counseling.",9,12.557094

2723,"Tips for slide / negative scanner - Wolverine Orange 20MP scanner
Edited: Aug 5 2013
Note: many of these comments apply to other Wolverine models as well as any negative scanner.

General Comments:

1. Only two-out-of- three attributes among Quality, Speed, and Cost are found in most products. With the Wolverine scanner, Quality takes the hit. But the speed and low cost make it a good choice for fast and easy scanning of slides and negatives to digitize a drawer full of memories. But don't expect miracles; this is not a studio-grade scanner. However, Wolverine's instant negative-to positive conversion, built-in screen, and quick action won't be found in many higher quality scanners. The ability to scan 4 images in 30 seconds (start to finish) is where the Wolverine scanner shines above many other models.

2. In my experience, black and white negatives from the 1960's look as good as the day I developed them as a teenager. And color slide film held up well over time. But my Kodak negative films held up with varying quality, with faded color being a common problem with film prior to the mid 1970's. The few Fuji rolls in my archive were generally too light, and had faded color. I had hoped to resurrect faded photo prints with a fresh negative. So I was disappointed that some photos survived better as faded prints in a photo book rather than in the original negative that had been stored for 40-50 years.

Film Trays:

3. Each film size and type has a specific film tray to hold the film flat and steady during the scan. However, an instant preview can be obtained by directly inserting a strip directly into the gadget. This lets you see a positive view of the negative image without using the tray. I also made a simple flat cardboard ""tray"" having a single 35mm-sized opening. This simplifies multiple previews; just set the film strip on the cardboard and slide it through the gadget. The cardboard tray almost worked for the few 110 size negatives I scanned without a proper carrier, but the lack of flatness produced distorted images.

4. The flimsy plastic film trays are surprisingly awkward to use. They sometimes feel like they will snap in your hands while being opened. But I have scanned approx. 1000 images and the tray is still working fine.

5. Negatives go in the tray with the convex side up--curved side is up, like a hill (not down like a valley). The ""Kodak"" name and negative numbers in the margin should read properly. Slides are more difficult to orient correctly, but the same principle applies--insert with the film curved like a hill. If you scan the wrong way the image can be easily flipped later with any photo manager or editor.

Film Cleaning:

6. Tiny specs are huge when scanned at high DPI. Therefore, at the very least you should clean the images carefully with air (i.e. a simple squeeze bulb) before inserting into the scanner. If you see specks try cleaning with liquid lens cleaner and tissue. Better cleaning can be done with 70% or 90% alcohol on a cotton swab. Caution: test your liquid cleaner on an unimportant piece of film before trying it on the dirty image.

7. Also clean the gadget's light internal source occasionally. The brush goes downward to clean the light table. The lens is way up inside and shouldn't need cleaning.

Scanning process:

8. Set up a production space to process the negatives and slides in an orderly manner. Sifting through hundreds or thousands of images is surprisingly confusing.

9. A clean workspace is essential, as are clean hands and still air. Don't even think about eating Cheetos while scanning negatives and slides.

10. If available, use a light table (like doctors use to examine X-rays) to quickly sort through negatives and slides before bothering to put them in a tray or in the scanner.

11. Although a bright desk lamp is useful for looking at negatives and inspecting for dust, a bright light can find its way into the scanner and affect the capture. So be careful not to let stray light shine on the scanner tray slots.

12. The gadget's software freezes up every now and then. Unplug the power and start over. You'll lose patience, but you shouldn't lose any images.

13. The scanner's small size is both a good feature and a minor problem--easy to store, but awkward to hold steady and press buttons while scanning. I found it best to place the scanner onto a few stacked books, approx. 6 inches tall, to make operation more convenient. The higher position also gives a better angle to the screen for a taller operator.

14. The ""Capture"" button snaps a photo of the slide or negative in the same manner as a regular digital camera. Therefore, any movement of the film or gadget during the capture may cause the image to blur. So make sure the unit and film carrier are stable before gently pressing the Capture button. After pressing Capture, examine the image and then press the ""OK/Enter"" button to save it. If you need to reshoot, move the cursor to the cancel icon and press Enter to retake the shot.

15. Slide the carrier only from right to left. The unit has a ratchet that might break of you go the wrong way. This direction will scan the negative numbers in reversed numerical order. Annoying, but not a big problem.

File processing and management:

16. I found it best to avoid pre-sorting images into groups prior to scanning. I just scanned them in the order I found them and let the scanner assign a sequential number (important: see the note on numbering below).

17. After scanning 100-200 images, I put them into a single folder on my computer. I then used a file manager/editor (I prefer ACDSee) to quickly view, delete, rotate, and rename the scanned images. Next, I used the ACDSee ""image basket"" feature to move groups of related images into their own folder. This ""triage"" method was less hassle than expected--it's faster to scan questionable images (without rotating etc on the scanner) and edit (or delete) them on the PC. This was much faster than sorting through all the images while they are still on the film strip, and then using the scanner's rotate feature.

18. Almost every image will need some color or brightness adjustment. ACDSee works well for this in an ""assembly line"" manner to quickly set white balance, and to crop images, while also doing the file handling. Tip: if the color is too far gone try converting the image to black and white. The B&W version might surprise you at how well it turns out.

19. Important: if you delete all the image files from memory the gadget will restart the numbering sequence at 0001. So when deleting files from the internal memory or SD card, leave the last (i.e. highest numbered) image in the file folder. This will trick the gadget to continue numbering later scans starting just after that image number. You can also copy an image into the memory with a file number one-less than what you want to start scanning with. The gadget seems to pick up where it left off based on the highest image seen on the card. (I haven't tested this thoroughly).

Exposure control:

20. The gadget sets an auto exposure level when the image is first seen by the scanner. This usually works well, but the exposure sometimes gets too far off, and the available +- 2EV adjustment isn't enough to compensate. So some images look fine when first examined by the gadget, but after a second or so they become too light. Although a proper exposure therefore seems possible, the software adjustment won't let you get there. I would prefer a simple control knob to adjust brightness over the unit's entire range.

21. If an image is too light at the maximum adjustment, insert a piece of exposed (clear) negative film under(not on top) of the strip being scanned. The blank film acts as a neutral density filter to reduce the light hitting the digital sensor. This blank strip is usually found at the beginning or end of a developed roll. Keep a clean strip handy because you will likely need it.

22. Recommended supplies:
 a) Light table for previewing negatives and slides
 b) White lint-free gloves to handle negatives and slides
 c) Small scissors for separating glued edges from strips, cutting strips, etc
 d) A few strips of clear blank developed film to serve as neutral density filter
 e) Air puffer and lens brush to clean film before scanning
 f) Lens cleaner solution and tissue to better clean dirty film
 g) Q-tips and alcohol to remove those ""stubborn stains"" and goo from film
 h) Box of tissue to dry your eyes after viewing all those long-lost photos
 i) Phone number for the Addiction Hotline because you will become hooked on scanning in your past.",11,14.608474
2724,"UPDATE: Been a year since I owned this printer and it performs very well. Print primarily journal articles and never had a problem. Get the extra paper tray if you can afford it. Tried some business cards recently (120lb card stock) and it worked very very well! The black toner is lower than the others but have not had to replace any of the cartridges yet. I should revise my rating to a 5 stars. I still use the printer through a dedicated print server (see below) and have not fiddled with the built-in networking. I have since writing this review also been using Win7 and again, prints beautifully, without any problems to speak of.

HP CP2025X Color LaserJet Printer (Same as the DN version but with the extra paper tray. Should really give it 5 Stars but feel the long terms costs are going to be high (toner).
I have the printer set up on a print server (Linksys, so not using its built in network capabilities on the CP2025X) and am using XP-Pro on all my machines. Don't print a whole lot (maybe ~100pages /month) and have had this printer for some 4 months. I use my HP Laserjet 1160Le to print my B&W stuff and that too is on its own printer server. Word of caution here, I already had the Linksys (Cisco Systems) print servers ($70each) from a couple of years ago but when I checked the built in networking in a cursory manner on the CP2025X with XP Pro it did not work out of the box. I was going to use the print servers anyway so I didn't play around to see if I could get the built in network capability going with XP Pro. I imagine it would work if I played around with it some.
The CP2025X replaces an Epson900 that I should have thrown out a long time ago. I researched the color laser printers and settled on this one. I did not want an inkjet because they are not near robust enough over the long haul (even the high end photo printers from Epson). The laser printers tend not to have issues with the nozzles getting clogged. This is a REAL issue if you tend not to use your printer all the time (daily). You spend a few minutes trying to get everything lined up to print with inkjet printers, however good or expensive, and frankly the end product is always suboptimal for color documents and pdfs. With the color laser printers I have used at work over the years you simply hit print, everything works every time. Paper jams on color laser printers are the fault of the operator (either too full or last sheet in a tray). On my Epson I could never get the same effortless printing. The CP2025X was something I could afford and had network capability, so not tied to a specific computer just the router. I never have to wonder whether it printed. I can wirelessly reach my router from upstairs and since the printer is actually hooked into the router (via a print server) I hit print and voila, I come down later and it is all done, perfectly. This happens regardless of whether the printer has been used in the past month.
I did consider the Xerox color printers but decided against them for a couple of reasons: I had used one at work off and on and the toner is actually a wax based product that can smudge. The printer was also a lot smellier than the laser printers and needed a few minutes warming up. You can actually smell the wax. I have a small study that the printer is in and I don't leave the windows open and didn't want the wax smell in there. The smell is a drawback with the CP2025X as well but less so. You do smell the toner and this can't be good. This is especially true when you first put the toner cartridges in or if you print out 50 pages at a time. Still, smells A LOT less than the Xerox. The Xerox print cartridges are a lot cheaper and that had me vacillating. In the end the CP2025X is a better product that will print hassle free in color and while the toner cartridges are expensive I am very glad I bought it.",10,9.281599

2734,"Note that this is a review of the non-Bluetooth version of this phone.

Unique features:
###########
1. Stores up to 100 phone book entries. Most other phones top out at 50.
2. Privacy mode lets you lock out all other handsets from listening in on your call.
3. Silent mode lets you turn off the ringer, letting your calls go straight to the answering machine.
4. Tele-coil support enables better performance with hearing aids (I didn't test this feature)

Other features:
###########
1. Great ergonomics. The phones are light, the display is clear, the keys are generously sized, and sound quality is excellent.
2. Speakerphone and answering machine work well.
3. Customized ring tones can be set for known individuals.
4. It is possible to access messages while away from home.
5. It has delivered close to its rated 7 hours of talk time.
6. Allows insertion of pauses within phone book entries - say for dialing an extension. Also allows calling cards, where you must dial a service number  before you input the actual phone number.

Quirks:
#####
1. All handsets share a single phone book, resulting in an annoying lag while it locks/accesses the phone book.
2. The dialing process for calling cards is unnecessarily complicated. Because of a silly limit on the number of phone number digits that can be stored, the service number must be stored in a separate phone book entry from the destination number. This requires a lot of hunting to dial such numbers.

Conclusion:
########

I love its battery life which is a key requirement for me as I take long calls from home. On my older phone, I had to keep switching between handsets before the day was done. Not so with these!

I also really like the size of its address book. When even cell phones can hold an almost unlimited number of entries, I can't imagine why so many other phones insist on a stingy 50-entry limit.

Overall, the pluses mostly end up outweighing the minuses - hence my 4-star rating.

1. Open front door
2. Turn off printer
3. While holding down the GO button, turn printer back on
4. When all four LEDs light up release GO button. All LEDs will turn off
5. Press the GO button 2 times. The 3 LEDs (toner, drum, paper) will light up solid
6. Press the GO button 5 times
7. Paper light will be blinking

2754,"The Alliance Brites multicolored bands are long and thin.

When shooting, you'll find them to stretch to almost two feet. They are finely cut, and have a nearly consistent parallel cut. In general, this provides for a straighter, more predictable shot, but this is only true for the short events. The thin cut, unfortunately, in combination with the length, results in to much elasticity, reducing the release snap and weakening speed sustained over distance.

The length in particular, creates severe air wobble, and the band hits with more of a buckshot effect rather than a sharp rifle hit. This impact dissipation is frustrating, as a band shot will not so much as tip a pop can.

These are, however, excellent bands for training use, especially for young shooters who need to learn rubber band shooting safety. They should not be considered competition-level bands.

Home offices will be impressed by the Alliance Brites' usefulness in banding papers. The colors, in my experience don't stain or hurt documents through over-tautness, but dry rot has occurred in some over the years, and they'll need occasional replacing.

You'll pay more than double for Latex Free. Regular is around $4.50 per pound box of 425 versus $13.25 for 380 on Latex Free bands. (There's less per pound when going Latex Free.)

Need the unique color? These do stand out. They are Orange, not red as appears in the amazon picture. Orange-Orange. Definitely orange. Orange also isn't typically sold, even in assorted. Great for identification, and also keeps people from stealing them (or knowing who's leaving them littered about.)

Reusability. You pay more, but if you're using the same bands over and over they hold up better than regular rubber. My wife uses these as a postal worker so they see hard use and hold up much better than cheap regular bands. If you're just wrapping something once and shipping it off (don't care) then you'll probably want to go with a (much) cheaper product.

 ""Size 64"" / #64 rubber bands are what the post office uses. They are the perfect middle ground between skinny and fat bands and good for pretty much any use.

These particular ones don't meet the government (GSA) standard (often referred to as ""Postal Grade"") because there are not enough of them per pound. (GSA requires 425.) They are superior in every aspect except weight.

These bands are clean (don't come covered in powder).

2763,"We do a lot of crafts, and it's fun to have more than one color of glitter. We don't bring it out all the time since the clean up is a pain (we have four kids from 2-9). Each bottle has a pour and sprinkle side, but with kids both sides are messy sides. But, if you're going to let glitter in your house, this is a great mix with a lot of options.

There's a good variety. Twenty-three of 24 are solid colors of a big variety. There are some duplicate colors within the different shapes. The only color that isn't a solid color is red, silver, and blue (with a bit of purple) in one bottle.  There are not only a variety of colors, but there is a variety of styles. Twelve of the 24 are fine iridescent glitter. By fine glitter, I mean the pieces are small pieces--almost like sand. Then six of the jars are metallic tinsel--flat little lines of glitter. The final six are tiny metallic squares.

I saw other complaints about small bottles, so I was expecting them to be pretty tiny. But each bottle is the standard 1/3 oz size I've gotten in every other glittler multi-pack I've seen. Yes, you can get 4 oz bottles for like 4 bucks. You're getting about nine oz here which is more expensive per oz, but you're getting a lot more fun with more options!",2,10.408591

2772,"First of all I went on line and read tons of reviews.  It appeared to be a 50/50 split between the good and bad.  So, in the reviews people mentioned the customer service to be biggest issue.  Well, I was on line and pushed the chat button on a Sunday and spoke with Heidi.  She answered all of my questions then I decided to buy from Radioshack instead of ordering bc it's about a mile from my house.  The most important aspect of this product is twofold.  First your computer must be running 24/7 and it must have a powered usb port with the correct format ie 2.0 or higher.  Plus you need a computer with alot of memory and should be a newer computer (not 5 yrs old). No one to date has memory bc the program runs in the background always taking up resources.  I plugged mine in and it worked flawlessly.  It did drop one call last night, but I unplugged it an plugged it back in.  Another issue people don't understand is that usb devices are pretty unstable and if there is any conflict with the devices, this will be thrown off line first.  All you have to do is unplug the device, then plug it back in and make sure windows identifies the device again usually by an audible noise.  I love the product and I understand that it is limited by my broadband connection and is further limited by the number of people on line when I am attempting to use my phone.  All of these things make this device tricky but if you know what to expect then you should be fine.  My mom's phone with a land line has problems weekly so don't think this is a bad product.

2773,"I got a great deal from Amazon so I thought it was time to replace the HP G85 All in One we had used for 9 years.

It was packed well.  There were pieces of tape in places I could not even imagine there could be tape.  Be sure to get them all.  The instructions were fine for the initial assembly.

It is true that it takes about 25 minutes to initialize.  Why?  What is the point?

Installing the printer was not easy.  Except for the desk top wired directly to the router, the software could never find the printer.  My computers are all Dell and the network is all LinkSys.  There is nothing exotic or strange about the home set up.  The laptops are using an access point and the software could never find the printer.  We had to force it by using the IP address to find it.  Only then could we install the printers using XP.

The Vista install was something else.  The HP installation software NEVER found the printer.  Not even with the IP address or being hooked directly.  However the Vista Add a Printer function DID work.  The HP Vista install disk just did not work.  Microsoft saved the day.

The printer works fine and has a lot of features.  I still have not figured out how to use the card reader to save photos.  Since the reader is considered a removable drive it believes that the pictures have already been saved.

And it is noisy!  When it ejects a page it makes a real racket.

The price and features make this a good deal.  I have come to expect a lot more from HP and this was not one of their best efforts. The installation should be idiot proof.  The software was obviously poorly tested.

You would probably be happy with the HP L7590 once it is installed",2,6.8205733

I will say that they cost about twice as much as the same envelopes we buy by the case of 100 from value mailers on here, so unless we have another art emergency, we'll stick with the less expensive envelopes. I do appreciate that they had these as a prime option, because that saved our butts, so despite the too high cost, I'm rating them 4 star as they do the job they are intended to do and available quickly when needed.",2,4.5317283

Still the prices aren't bad, and if it encourages a reluctant reader then it's easily worth the price.  I wouldn't have seen the value when I just had one kid, when I had plenty of time to sit and read with him.  That kind of 1:1 time is way more valuable on many levels.  However as our family has grown that kind of focused time has to be rationed out a bit, having this around to help with the reading hasn't been be a bad thing.  It's pretty easy to use, and the kids seem to enjoy it.  If your kid is naturally motivated to read and write, I'm not sure I'd add yet another electronic device into their overly programmed lives.  However some kids don't gravitate that easily to reading, and in that case this can really help.  And if it helps an overloaded family, well then all the better.",3,6.2618947
2777,"There are several issues with this mat. The main one is that it doesn't stay in place. Unless you have a stationary chair this mat will slowly work its way one direction or another until you slide it back.

It also deforms very easily. This means that you will form ruts under the wheels/legs of your chair and when you go to move you have to ""get out of the groove."" This plasticity also means that if the mat slides up against other furniture it will begin to curl. While it's easy to cause these ruts and curls, they don't come out easily.

The mat is shipped rolled up and is a bear to flatten out for use even when given plenty of time to warm up (you may even want to try it outside in the sun). Flattening may be easier with two people but plan on having some heavy objects to weigh it down.",2,6.7652125

2781,"I enjoy this pen, I do. It's not my smoothest writer nor is it my most consistent writer, but I does well as an everyday pen. So here's why I like it and what I wish were better about the pen:

What I enjoy:
- It's also not so expensive that I'll need some fluoxetine in case I lose the thing
- It looks way better than what it costs. I'm also a sucker for demonstrators
- For the cost, it is a good writer
- Mine came with a converter
- Nib has some nice detailing on it
- Posts fairly well for those among us who can palm a basketball (not I)

What I wish could be better:
- It feels like what it is, a plastic pen. It just doesn't have enough...substantiality to it versus, say, my Lamy Safari which is also plastic
- Nib, although it looks sweet, could perform more consistently. I had to open the tines on mine a smidgen to get the flow the way I liked
- The grip section is quite smooth, and I find myself adjusting my grip more than I'd like

Writing:
It is not the most reliable pen out of the box and did skip somewhat even after the ritual rinsing before the first inking. The fine nibbed version (which I own) is about the same as a Lamy fine, although as I mentioned, I did open the tines on mine a bit. Your mileage may vary. The pen writes a western fine with minimal line variability with pressure and direction. Nib has some feedback, more than the similarly priced Pilot Metropolitan (which in my opinion is one of the smoothest writers for under $20). Rubbing the tip over a brown paper bag a few times should smooth this issue out, but for the price of the pen, I haven't really bothered to try.

Bottom line:
All in all, a nice demonstrator for under $20. I would get this if you enjoy demonstrators or if you want a decent fountain pen that you won't have to worry about losing.
I would not recommend this as a pen for someone interested in getting his or her first fountain pen due to the nib's skipping issues and unreliable performance out of the box. With a bit of fiddling, the pen can be a pleasant everyday writer. For a few extra dollars, a Lamy Vista would be a more reliable demonstrator with smoother writing, although you will need a separate proprietary Lamy converter purchase if you want to get off of cartridge ink.

2784,"Now that typewriters have gone the way of the 8-track player, I needed something to print file folder labels, as I did in the 'old days'.  Avery, of course, always comes through.  The paper is very thick, heavy stock - after folding the two sides with the adhesive backing, both sides stick together to make it even heavier.  I also supplemented it by putting the 'cardboard' insert that comes with the make-your-own Pendaflex folders/tabs in between before adhering together.  The template is available online on the Avery site -- which makes it super simple to 'type' on using your computer and Word program.  As others may have mentioned, the alignment is a bit off -- but that didn't bother me (although I should have printed one test tab first, but did not) - since one side is perfect [and the only side you view anyway]; the other side needs an extra space on top -- which is easy enough to correct. Printing from my ink-jet printer (using the manual rear  slot) was also a cinch - and my printer can be finicky; but it took one 'jam' message - remove, re-insert, good to go.

For years I have used an old expanding file for my monthly bills -- using sticky notes to indicate the contents.  Of course, they fall off after a few months -- but it did allow for some level of flexibility.  Finally I decided it was time to get organized -- but maintain that element of flexibility.  Hanging folders with easily changeable Pendaflex tabs, to the rescue!

Now, with these inserts you really do not even need to use the plastic inserts that come with the Pendaflex folders - as a matter of fact, the plastic tab covers really don't fit exactly right - but I decided to put the Avery tabs in the plastic to resist wear and tear anyway.  Since these Avery tabs are so sturdy you can just slide them into the Pendaflex slots without the clear plastic -- it probably won't hold up as well, but it does look a bit nicer if visual presentation is more important.",2,6.932464

As for its ink supply, like all gel pens it simply won't write as long as a ball-point or roller-ball pen.

You place the tip of the labeler against one of these labels, and record a message about what the item is and any other pertinent information about it. Then, when you touch the tip to the label again, it reads what you have recorded. Well sometimes, there is a need to encase one of these labels in plastic to make them water proof, or to be able to attach one to an item that the adhesive will not stick to. So, I laminate one of them in one of these pouches, and cut it out to whatever size I want, punch a hole in it, and attach it to the item in question via a tie wrap, rubber band, etc. It works great, as you can record the labels right through the plastic.

2799,"My daughters are getting to the age where we're getting ready for college and in addition to a laptop computer, a inexpensive printer/scanner is essential. The Epson Expression Home XP-320 fits that bill very nicely. It allows both wireless and connected printing and can be used to print through 'the cloud' or by inserting an SD card from a camera.

Setup is exceedingly easy. After powering up the unit, one is prompted to insert the four cartridges, then wait a short time while the printer initialized. Since I like the flexibility of wireless printing, I prefer to join the printer to the local network so we can access it from iOS devices as well as our Macintosh computers.

Once the printer is joined to the network, adding it to your Mac is dirt simple. Just open the preferences panel, select printer/scanner and press ""+"" to add a new printer. The system detects the printer on the network and loads the appropriate drives. From that point on, you just use it to print or scan. The XP-320 allows a variety of scanning resolutions and does a great job for pretty much anything we tried.

Print quality is adequate for day-to-day use and having separate ink cartridges means you don't waste ink if you run out of one color before another.
Photo quality is not quite as good as my high end photo printer, but it's pretty close overall.

my only con with it is the pages are really thin so if you write with a dark pen it'll show through to the next page, I recommend using a pencil or a light gel pen

2802,"I just bought the Vtech DS632-4. So far so good. I am using VOIP, but it seems to me that this phone loves that.  I am sure it will performs as well with a traditional POST line. I had the Panasonic KX-TG7434, and the only feature that I ""miss"" is the talking caller ID and some ring tones, other than that, the Vtech is much better phone.

PROS:

-Fast dialing comparing to the Panasonic. The Panasonic is very sloooow in dialing.
- The bluetooth. It pairs really nice with my Iphone. I am sure it will pair with any other cell phone, just keep in mind that you need to keep your cell phone next to the base of the Vtech to get the best signal posible, that way you can use the Vtech to make and receive phone call using your cell line or just switch to your land line or VOIP in my case. The Home Button to the left is for land line, the Cell Button to the right is for cell calls.
- Easy to recall previous number dialed up to 50 per the owner's manual, and 50 received.  You can transfer your cell contact list, it will not transfer all the numbers if you have more than one for a particular contact. Per the manual you can have or transfers using bluetooth up to 6000 contacts! Holy Cow!!! I have about 200.
- Easy to edit a number that you are dialing. I have not seen that feature on cordless phone.
- Loud and Clear, not question about this.

CONS:
-Limited  and not so pleasant (ugly) ring tones. Come on Vtech, Is it that hard to upload some nice ring tones?
-Now, the keypad is illuminated, but the Menu, Home, Cell, and Off buttons are not,  this makes kind of hard to see those buttons in the dark, specially is your vision is kind of weak such is mine. Don't get fool but those pictures that you see on the Net.
- The phone display uses the matrix type, it would have been nice is Vtech had made the numbers and letter a little bit bigger.

Overall the Vtech is a very nice phone, the blue color of the display and keypad makes it to look modern! It has a nice answering machine, I don't use it  because the VOIP offers tons of features that it will be hard to ignore. The keypad feels good and responsive.",31,14.178803

2804,"Arrived on time and in good shape.  The sharpener gives a nice ""long"" point as advertised.

It's easy to use, but I would watch out for one thing:  the instructions and several online videos say to turn the crank handle until you feel it obviously ""loosen"" with no resistance to your cranking.  This means the pencil is now sharp and ready to remove.  I found that more often than not, the 'resistance' doesn't seem to noticeably lessen, and the pencil will continue to be ""sharpened"" until the movable faceplate holder again meets the main body of the unit.  You watch your pencil quickly disappear!

Experiments with *my* sharpener show that if my drawing pencil is dull and needs to be sharpened, I only need to crank the handle 3-4 times (no matter the handle ""resistance"" I feel), and my pencil is ready.  Naturally, a brand new unsharpened pencil will take a few more cranks.  My advice is to play with your particular sharpener and get a feel for how many cranks it takes.  Again - the sharpener (granted, mine's new) works very, very well ... and it will thusly chew through your pencil very quickly if you just keep cranking waiting for that magic ""loose handle"" feeling.  5 stars.

2806,"Originally created for the art making in student situations, I have used this product as a professional artist for many years (originally only available in Sepia hue).  The chunky size makes it easily held in the hand (end in palm of hand with tip parallel to your index finger and secured you your thumb on the outside edge).  This allows for a freer and less heavy handed than a normally held pencil.  Best characteristics include:  easy of use, the initial waxy application and the ability to blend with your fingers or with water/brush.  The new selection of hues will be  a favorite for students and artists.  I use it in illustration work and works on paper.",17,7.6692715

2808,"I wanted a plastic clipboard for my watercolor colored pencil art, but all I had was a hard paper clipboard which will fall apart when wet.

2809,"Good paper. Quality paper. I use these for hand written notes that I write with caligraphy pen or fountain pen. Noodler's Bulletproof Black ink and a triple fold with red wax seal usually completes it.

A nice and crisp heavy stock that soaks up good ink, doesn't feather, and doesn't bleed through. This is what quality paper can be.

I'm seeing a lot of people complaining about the watermark - this is good paper with the paper maker's name and material in light watercolor. This is a sign of quality, but a lot of people think they're ""too good"" for this? Southworth paper was used by men, like Abraham Lincoln, for correspondence.

Quality paper with a proud watermark is good enough for United States' presidents, but isn't good enough for people spamming out wedding invitations or thank you cards I guess.

This is like driving a BMW and complaining about all the BMW emblems on your car.
Or getting a Montblanc pen and complaining about the white star or the Montblanc etched inscription on the cap.

This is highly archival cotton paper, which is known to last hundreds of years without appreciable fading, discoloration, or deterioration. Combined with good ink, you will have a document that lasts a long long time.

Hence the watermark proof of quality. Even Strathmore paper will have a watermark.

If you don't like the watermark, you can search around for companies that will make custom orders, but the quality will not be the same. Or just stick to generic and cheap pulp paper.

If you honestly don't know/care about paper, why even use quality paper?",19,9.587638
2810,"The scanner is great and performs as advertised.

The case is hard and will do a good job of protecting the scanner, however it is quite tight.  Another 1/8"" in length would have made a lot of difference.  I am afraid that putting the scanner in and out of the case will eventually cause a problem with the scanner.  The case also provides nowhere to put the AC adapter, which is really not that big.  You are lucky to get the scanner and the USB cable in it.

They tried to make the case small enough to hold the scanner and still get in something the size of a purse.

These are the smoothest writing pens I've ever used. I love the purple color, and my bank doesn't mind that I use them on checks. They make my handwriting so pretty, because there is no fatigue when I use them.

2819,"Just received the shredder.  It is heavy, appears to be very well built
  and came totally assembled and ready to use.  Finished shredding a bunch
  of things that I was shredding when my old one shot craps.

  Its very quiet, but not totally quiet and it ate everything I put down it.
  It didn't jam or overload.

  I'd say, for the money, it probably can't be beat.  I'll amend this if
  problems develop in the future.  Ordered it Sunday afternoon from
  Hippovariety thru Amazon and Fedex delivered it about 9AM Tuesday.
  It doesn't get much better than that.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Ok, its several days later and I've used it more.  Dropped the rating from
  5 to 4 stars.  It will handle 16 sheets like it says but that actually seems
  to be pushing the limit.  From the sound it makes, its being overworked.

  I've had it indicate the bin was full a couple of times when it was nearly
  empty.  I'm guessing there were shreds hanging down from the jaws that triggered
  that.  Also, when it does jam (very seldom) the paper below the jaws is severed
  so it appears that it doesn't have anything to grab hold of when you try to
  reverse it.  Lastly, I used it long enough it got warm and the thermal switch
  kicked in and turned it off, but there is no light or indicator to tell you its
  overheated.  An overheated light would be nice.  There is a light that flashes if
  you try to put too much down the jaws, but NOT one to tell you its overheated and
  thermally shut down for a while.

THEN I read the instructions for my new, heavier-duty model....  Apparently petroleum-based oil is a potential fire hazard... who knew?  (This Fellowes oil is vegetable oil based).
AND they recommend oiling every 30 minutes of use.
Big difference after following instructions... much quieter and much longer time between ""I'm too hot"" breaks.

The answer is they rock, here is why I give them a 10 out of 10!

EASY TO USE - 10 out of 10
The packs are designed to be used easily. You can quickly pull post its and they never stick together or come out messy. They rock, because often times post it post to the things you don't want or come out stuck all other.

ACTUAL USE  10 out of 10
When you put them on paper, they do not fall off easily. Often times paper post it notes do this. Instead when you put them on the page, they don't bulk up the pages (they are thin) and you can easily pull on the tabs and go to the page they are stuck on. This makes it an excellent bookmark resource for signature pages. Love them, especially for documents that have some 30+ signatures!

MATERIAL  10 out of 10
The material is a light plastic with a slight paper feel. They are strong and you can write on them, a major plus! Pencil and pen both work on them.

TEAR PACKS  10 out of 10
The packs tear off easily, so if you want 5 colors to stay together or you wanted just one color to throw in your purse, the packs are built to breakup/tear apart. What is nice is the containers are not cheap. So tearing them apart does not make a mess and they look professional. I do not hesitate to pull them out in front of clients, because they are clean looking.

NOTE TAKING  10 out of 10
With the quality, it makes it super easy to use them to identify notes. So when I am taking notes, I will use them in my document to identify where I need to return to. I use different colors for different reasons. They are an excellent tool for visual use.

REUSABLE 9 out of 10
They cost a lot, so I reuse them a tone. I can often times use them up to 5-10 times! That means I paste them to a page and a few days later I come back, pull them off and paste them to another page. Often times I use cotton pages, so they become warn faster due to the paper being softer.

I love these! A little costly, but they are effective. You will be amazed how something so small can be so useful!",2,14.510306

2823,"I usually use these for crochet patterns. Each sleeve will hold several sheets of paper. I even use these sheet protectors  for entire magazines, such as Discover, Crochet! & Crochet Today.  I purchased them as an add-on item @ $2.97 for a pack of 25.  They seem to be durable, but the style has changed slightly from the package I purchased  5+ years ago. The old style had a reinforced binding edge - other than that, the new style seems to be the same quality.",6,8.1257305
2824,This product is complete JUNK!!  It totally messed up my printer.

2825,"Save yourself the time and trouble - over the past month (August 2004) I have tried the latest models of just about every major brand that offers 5.8 ghz multi-handset cordless phones - Uniden, V-Tech, AT&T (made by V-Tech), Motorola, and Panasonic. Each of these phones is nice in its own way, but only the Panasonic had enough range to receive and send clearly from one end of the house to the other. Granted my house is a little large (3,600 square feet, all one one level), but the other brands maxed out about 2/3rds of the way through the house. I have a WiFi network in the house, and had no interference issues from that with any of these brands. I do wish the Panasonic could expand to a total of more than just 4 handsets, but that is a minor issue. Those big honking twin antennae on the base unit seem to actually work.  Please note that I got the version without the answering machine,  so I can't offer any opinions on that part of this.",15,8.612666

When I received the printer, I found out that I the only differents of 4640 and 4630 are the paper tray.
I put this printer at home, and barely use it. The ink run out very fast, not even 100 pages. I can't believe it because I barely  use it!! The color quality is 4 star, a little off with the original color.
when the ink runs out, in the beginning I don't believe that, because I barely use it!! When I check the ink cartages, they are all empty. So I have to buy a new set of ink. So I searched online for the ink. THEY ARE SO EXPENSIVE!$90~$150 for one set! For that quality and for that usage? it doesn't not worth of purchase new inks,and they don't even have cheaper version of remanufactured ink cartages. I just want to wait for the cheaper ink comes out on market. And now, I can't do work at home because this wrong purchase. I brought an HP inkjet color printer at Fry's for my office at same time when I purchased this printer, the color and printing qualities and price of the ink is 10 times better than this one!!! I am very regret that I purchased this printer. And since it is over a month, I don't think it can be return.",14,10.363716

I had to bear down pretty hard to do so.  I don't see how it would cut 400 hundred sheets as advertised, maybe 10lb paper.  Maybe the 17 inch model would do it with a longer handle.  But I will never need to cut more than the 80 to 100 sheets of 24lb or thinner paper so it works very well for me.

2829,"The Canon i9900 is absolutely wonderful.  For home or business this printer produces high quality photos.  I have printe virtually every size photo, all the way up to 13x19 and have yet to be disappointed!  The 3 extra ink colors add that extra bit of quality to the photos.  I've printed many photos on my i9900, framed them, and proudly display them throughout my house.  For my children's sports I've taken tons of photos with my DSLR, printed them out on 4x6 Canon paper and distributed them to the kids in the photos (teammates).  Everytime I do this, the parents are always amazed when I tell them that I printed them out at home.

If you get this printer, I highly recommend sticking with only Canon inks and Canon photo paper.  yea, the other stuff is cheaper, but you won't get the quality that you do with the geniune Canon supplies.  Of course I've not tried every generic photo paper out there, but I have tried several and compared them all to the Canon, and you can really tell the difference.

for the price and quality you get with this printer, you won't be disappointed.  If you want/need to print photos larger than 8.5x11, then this is the printer for you!",14,14.467099
2830,"Wow, I was really pleasantly surprised by this speaker!  Setting up with my iphone over bluetooth was super easy.

It comes with a cute flannel case, though I found this added to the bulk of the unit and wasn't really needed, so just carry it in my bag without the case.  The amount and quality of sound that comes out of this little box is really impressive.  I plan on using it to play music on the go as well.",2,3.9772599
2831,"If you want a good fountain pen, then by all means buy one, or two, or three. Is Montblanc the best manufacturer? Hard to say yes. I'd rank Parker, Waterman, Aurora, Pilot, Pelikan, Sailor, and a few more higher than Montblanc today. Yes, their pens used to be amongst the best - they also used to come with a lifetime warrantee and a much smaller price-tag. But Montblanc has gotten itself into the new-money luxury branding game and now all that matters is the snowcap they've spent countless millions in promoting as a symbol of jet-setting coolness. Notice that in the past twenty years they've slapped their name onto many other ""luxury items"", even a line of perfumes. There's no such scent as ""Arrow"" by Parker, or ""W"" by Waterman for a good reason. Of course, no trained pen makers have anything to do with producing Montblanc's new luxury products - one has to wonder if they have anything to do with producing the pens any longer, either.",29,11.010561
2832,"Bold bright colors and love how they actually have color names on the markers! I think all permanent markers that come in so many diff colors should put color  names on them! This marker brand has names on all different tip sizes. Think, fine point and ultra fine tip. Makes it great if your working on project and have big & small areas to color in u know exactly which color is the same you used instead of taking guess & end up 1 shade off. So besides the slight bleeding specially from how u hold it n how much pressure you use, these are my new fav permanent markers and they great to use in coloring books and school projects! I've bought them in all tip sizes, and working on all colors! Just wish they had neon colors",4,4.9492426

2836,"As my title states, this is quite literally the only pencil I use. It has a nice elegant touch that makes it look somewhat expensive. Work very well, but the rubber grip got slick after a couple months of writing. As in, the rubber grip doesn't really help me grip the pencil anymore. The erasers included work well, and the eraser is huge (compared to most other pencils). The barrel is considerably thicker than the conventional cheap mechanical pencils. Makes writing a tad bit easier. My only real complaint is that the upper portion gets separated from the bottom portion a bit too easily for me to like.",16,4.892369

Each square is roughly 1.5 inches tall by 2 inches wide. Hope this helps someone out :)",4,6.9564695
2840,"The Letter Construction Activity Set is like no other that I've seen on the market.  This set comes with 88 large child friendly plastic pieces  that can be easily snapped together to make every letter of the alphabet both upper and lowercase! The colorful pieces store easily snapping into each other and makes for keeping things tidy in the classroom without any worry of lost parts. The number of pieces makes this set large enough to use with four children at one time and that's a great bonus in any classroom.

The set also comes with 13 double sided activity cards which instruct children in which way they can create the letters showing what pieces and how the finished letter should look. There is also a great many suggest activities in which you can do in your classroom with your students such as Letter Matching ( matching the uppercase letter with the lower case), Beyond Letters ( an activity that encourages children construct something other than letters with the pieces),  and so on.

My daughter sat for one day discovering and learning how she could make letters but she wasn't just limited and went on to even making a few numbers and then hearts and flowers! At first she had a little trouble taking the pieces apart but within 10-15 minutes of using these she has had no issues at all.

The possibilities are endless with the Letter Construction Activity Set! It is great for brain stimulation, developing fine motor skills, problem solving, letter recognition,  and pre-writing skills. Even my 1 1/2 year old son was getting on in the action. He's learning his alphabet now so he was pretty excited to see us building letters and he called out what they were! Pretty soon he'll be able to build them on his own too with this set!

There's nothing we don't love about the Letter Construction Activity Set from Learning Resources, in fact, we highly recommend it! It's durable, long lasting, and sure to be loved by any child and by any teacher looking out for the best interest of their students.",9,10.656352
2841,"To give you some idea of what  great product this is, I would like to mention that after experimenting with the first one I bought, I ordered a second one so that I now own one for home and one for work.

This scanner is smaller and lighter than it might appear in its photos, about the size of a loaf of bread.  It has only one button, ""scan,"" and it can handle a large fairly messy stack of differently-sized documents, newspaper clippings and so on rested into the auto-feeder chute without a hiccup. It scans quickly and I have only had it jam on me only once or twice since I bought it several months ago and I have used it almost daily.  Even if a document gets run through crooked, the scanned image comes out straight.

By default it scans in duplex mode (both sides of any document you feed into it) and the included Adobe Acrobat software lets you remove pages you decide you don't want after the scan and/or addend pages from other files even if they are of different file formats (e.g. you can add a multi-page Word document to a multi-page PDF).

The file management software that it comes with is counter-intuitive at best. I am pretty smart and I can't make heads or tails of most of the functions available in the ""ScanSnap Organizer.""  The included electronic manual is almost no help at all and when I experimented on my own, the ScanSnap Organizer software made all these extra little particles worth of strips of parts of the scanned image...  ?  What?! So after scanning a document, I just save the document to a well-named folder of my choice on my computer's hard drive and organize all scanned documents, thus, ""by hand.""

I do recommend this product. I awarded four stars rather than five for the crummy software.  But I've made it work for me quite well and am glad I own it.  Definitely worth the price several times over.",3,8.552999
2842,"I have mixed feelings about this.  I purchased this and a simpler, lighter weight one from another company for $15.  I prefer the other one over this.  It's not an awful laptop tray, but for bamboo, it's kind of on the heavy side, and a tad bulky.  It's quite cool looking, but I'm not sure I won't end up hiding it in a closet and forgetting about it.

The legs, even though they are adjustable, tend to splay out too far, so it doesn't much help to adjust the height of the legs. One other problem with this device is that if you are short, and your feet don't easily reach the ground from your seat, you either have to have your legs up at all times (which can get uncomfortable after a while), or you have to sit on the edge of your seat, which means the tray has no choice by fall off the edge of the couch or chair, because there is no support for the front legs.

The cup holder isn't very practical for real cups, though not a major concern.  The part that tilts is uncomfortable to use, because you can't comfortably rest both forearms on the surface.  While it has air vents for the laptop, they have the down side of making the tray impractical if you want to write anything by hand on its surface.

I solved the problem of the drawer falling out by gluing magnets to the back of the drawer.",3,6.1946096

2846,"Ah, the good life.  As I type this I am nestled cozily under the covers of my bed with my surface pro 3 sitting on my brand new sofia and sam's deluxe memory foam lap desk.  No longer am I shackled to my desktop.  This is a great laptop desk.  Sofia and Sam seemed to have thought about just about everything when they designed this slacker's table...

Comfort.....  definitely 5 out of 5 stars.  This rests easily on my legs and does not have any awkward angles or points.  I like that the part that sits on you is NOT made of those little beads.  This is foam all the way.  And the wrist rest is thoughtfully placed.  I wish it was removable for those times when I might not want a wrist rest but I can't imagine that would happen all that often.  And, the added bonus of the wrist rest is that it keeps your laptop from sliding into you lap.

Size....  For me, this is perfect.  The surface pro 3 has a pretty small footprint, but this desk has plenty of room even for the big boys.  A 17"" laptop should have no problem on this thing. five out of five stars again.

Looks.....  not that looks matter, but for those of you concerned about it, this thing is a real looker.  I bought the one with the black cushion.  I was afraid it would look drab.  It doesn't. another five out of five.

Function.....  You have got to love a company that goes the extra mile and this company certainly did.  As I type this I've plugged in the little light that it comes with.  It hardly seems bright at all and yet it is doing a very nice job  illuminating the surface pro's keyboard.  I don't really need it because I am not a college student who has to worry about keeping their roommate awake while I stay up till all hours writing a term paper (you can feel sorry for me....  people didn't own computers when I was in college and I had to pay someone handsomely to type my dissertation).  So, if you need a light this is a good addition.  I love how it stores away in the cushion and that you can find the battery compartment in the cushion as well.  And yet when you look at this thing you can't tell that there is a light and a battery compartment stowing away.  I really wanted to deduct a half a star for the fact that this thing doesn't open up at all to give you a place to store pens and paper or flash drives or backup drives or other computer peripherals.  I think if Sofia and Sam come up with a second generation of this nifty lap desk they should consider a peripheral's compartment.  But alas....  the fact that they thought of such a clever light and battery compartment makes up for the fact that they left out a little storage space.  But lets not make that mistake again.  So, function also gives this 5 out of 5.

Whenever I am reviewing an item I try to also take into consideration the price paid.  I am not going to hold a 20 dollar bluetooth speaker to the same standard as a sonos system.  I will still point out pros and cons but will take price into account.  When it comes to this laptop table/desk the fact is that the pricing was excellent.  Very very reasonable for what you get.  I think it was priced just right.

BOTTOM LINE:  Well crafted and well thought out.  Highly recommend",13,7.322058
2847,"Such a funny case! It's quite big but I like that it's big because I always carry too many pens and pencils! I decided to be more minimalistic with my pencil case and so I carry less pens and only bring ones that I ACTUALLY use. This is good because now I can fit my scientific calculator, little pouch of post its and page flags, glue stick, mini stapler, pencil sharpener, and random things. This is a truly carry it all pouch. The material is kind of plasticky and tough. It feels like a tarp feels like. I get so many compliments at school from this pouch. Everyone looks twice and laughs a lot! I would totally reccomend this pouch for anyone with a large and messy purse or backpack, is traveling light, needs for a bit of organization, needs a large yet well sized pencil pouch, or just needs something to carry everything in a portable fashion! I had so much trouble choosing which pouch I wanted because they were all so funny and cute. I chose the 'random crap' one because it was hilarious and representative of me as a person and it wasn't too inappropriate for school/public use.
It's been a week or so since I've started using it and it's been holding up pretty well the front and back seem to have a more worn feel(it looks the same) but I'm not sure if that's my fault or if it's the packages fault. I don't really mind because it's a thin sheet of plastic like material and it's bound to become more flexible than rigid!

2849,"The Smead Project Organizer is a good idea if you have an important project or event that you need to keep track of over time, provided you won't have lots and lots of paperwork with the project.

Pros: The inside front cover allows you to spell out the task, record pertinent contact information and track the dates of tasks.

Each section (1-10) then has an area for notes on the front tab and a pocket for storing paper(s).

The binding for the 10 sections is nicely sturdy while still allowing for some accordian movement.

Cons: The individual pockets are pretty light-weight and won't hold much paper/receipts/notes etc. If you had a multi-step project that you were looking over on a regular basis and/or daily this organizer is likely to get beat up.  If you have a project that you are visiting less often and just need to keep organized than this would fit the bill.

Other:  I wish the organizer had 12 sections so that it could be used for a year-long project, etc. - it seems more designed for the college student or teacher who has a 10 month school year.

Also, all the sections after the cover have two one-inch holes through them about three inches from the top and bottom (not visible in the picture I saw because papers were filed in the pockets).  I'm not sure of the intent of the holes, they don't really allow you access to the different sections, particularly once some papers have been filed into the pockets.  I'd have rathered they weren't there.

I'd recommend the organizer for folks who need to track something over time that won't generate a ton of paperwork but that still needs to stay organized. For a project with a big amount of paperwork, you might still consider an accordian file with closure but this is a nice alternative for smaller paper projects.",5,9.42116

2852,"This is a great shredder.  I've had it for about 6 months and it's been awesome.  I've probably shredded about 130 gallons of documents with it.  I've sometimes put in too many documents and jammed it, but it's easy to unjam.

However, the plastic bin that holds up the motor is cheap and it is showing signs of warping due to the heavy weight of the top.  I am not sure how long the shredder is going to hold up without some kind of reinforcement on the right side.

One of my concerns with buying this shredder was the need for special bags, but I've found it works fine without buying the overpriced bags.  I have a large garbage can in my office and I can dump the shredder bin into it without making much of a mess.

The motor is very quiet, the cross-cut pieces are small enough that I feel comfortable shredding very valuable information and discarding it in the trash.  For the price, I feel it's a good buy--but it loses a star for being too cheap with the plastic bin.",3,6.3331227

2854,"When I'm transcribing a particularly interesting document, I go into a ""zone"" and miss everything around me: I don't notice it getting dark outside and forget to turn on the lights until my eyes hurt, I forget to take lunch, and sometimes I forget to move. I keep a heating pad in my office because my neck aches so badly by the end of the work day.

Easel document holders do make a difference.  You don't realize just how much, though, until you have to work without one.  There wasn't one at the desk I was assigned when I was hired, and the pain that first week was horrible. By the end of the week, I decided to buy one out-of-pocket.  The following Tuesday (YAY Amazon Prime!), I had it and, once I'd labeled it [as my own], I brought it to work. The difference was amazing.

Of note: the clip is nice and strong. At least twice in my career, I've had document easels with flimsy clips, and wound up using binder clips to hold my papers in place. Also of note: the guide bar didn't break when I put it together.

2855,"It's not listed on the description, but this also works for hp 74(xl) cartridges.
The reviews which say how easy this is to use are pretty on target. i just want to describe how to use it for those debating to buy this, I didn't see this info when i was thinking of purchasing.

the top half contains the black ink- 84ml of black ink. a long needle is attached to the top. You place a plastic guide on top of your cartridge. and then you hook your cartridge on the gray holder.
You flip the ink container upside down and place the gray piece (with your cartridge attached) inside. the needle will go thru the exposed hole and pierce the foam inside. Then you flip the container and wait for the ink to fill your cartridge. The directions say to watch for when the air bubbles stop. and the ink tank is marked so you can watch for level change.

If your cartridge's foam is dried out (taking the cartridge out of the printer too long, or waiting too long to refill) the ink won't penetrate. But next time you'll know better to make sure you refill as soon as you notice the ink getting low on your cartridge. this will help extend the life of your cartridge. usually you can get 4-5 cycles on your cartridges. My cartridge was too dried out (dead) but this refill system will work great on my next cartridge.

After using couple of months wirelessly I faced issue where printer stopped printing wirelessly .To overcome i followed sollowing steps .
Solution :
First of all print report from local printer by pressing menu then press 5 followed by 6 (Network Configuration) and press Start .Page`ll print and look for IP ADDRESS on that page .Make sure is it via DHCP or Manually .Second look for Wireless Link status .If it says LINK OK .Your wireless communication is fine .Reset your router by rebooting and print another Network configuration page. This time you`ll see different IP address .keep page close to you and follow following steps .

Click on Start, then Control Panel, then Printers and Faxes. Right click on the Printer and select Properties.

On the printer properties window, select Ports tab and click on Add Port .Choose ""Standard TCP/IP port"" type in IP Address on that printed page) and press next ,next and Finish.

Now again go to local printer and press menu then 6-->2-->1 (Boot Method) and scroll down until you see STATIC then press ok .
Goal is to assign static ip address on printer and computers .No need to do anything to router settings. You can follow same procedure on all computers that stopped printing.

I was looking for very specific set of qualities. Must were Duplex printing speed, wifi connection,scanning,fax ,two sided copier and low noise level .Pretty much it was only printer that came with all these set of qualities within $250 range .Set up was extremly simple just insert CD ( i DL through brother site) and  click next,next and you all done.only con about this printer could be App for ipad/iphone. it only scans documents that you place under printer hood and can email 'em or store 'em to your device but if you want to print web page or document using smart phone you need desktop/laptop to do so.

2865,"This is a large printer with lots of features that work well.  I set this up on the wireless function to operate with my Mac.  It only took one setup and I've experienced no problems with the range, which I did experience on my HP initially.  Sending documents to print is a fast and easy task.  It has an easy to use and good looking large touchscreen to take you through each menu.  This is great and time saving when compared with other printers. Having the ability to print ledger photos without going to a printer store is fantastic and I used it to make several posters for our portfolio.

Now to the caveat, big or small depending on your needs. The print quality is not nearly as good as the HP.  It's comparable to other brands, very similar to what Lexmark puts out, but could not compare in color quality to my HP.  Yesterday, I needed to print out a color chart for our business products and I did a couple on the normal settings on my HP.  Then my ink got low so I switched over to the Brother to make a couple on there.  I decided to put it on the best quality settings because I wanted the colors to be very vibrant.  It takes a good bit of time to print on the high quality setting so I was expecting a lot and was very disappointed when it was finished.  The colors looked washed out or a bit faded when held side by side to what I had just printed on the HP and took 3 times as long to print.  I took it without saying which was which and showed it to my husband who pointed to the HP document and said that it was so much better and that there was no comparison.  As far as my color chart, the HP was very usable and the Brother not at all.  To be fair, the Brother has settings for its color printer that you can manually enter.  I'm just not adept enough to do that, to know which settings to set the colors on.  But as far as default printing, you won't get top quality photo printing, you will get adequate printing.  So, the bottom line is if you need high quality color printing, then this might not be the right printer for you.  But if you are an occasional photo printer or primarily use it for office or business documents where vibrant color quality is not required, then this is a great, easy to use multi-function printer and you should give it a try.",67,8.643129

2868,"The Canon PR10-G Wireless Presentation Remote is a viable lecture tool for users of both Keynote and Power Point, but it's not perfect.

The remote comes with batteries, a USB dongle, and a thin, zip-up case.  The case seems fancier in the pictures than it really is, but it will protect your remote from scratches if you throw it in a laptop bag.  The USB dongle is stored in the bottom of the remote.  Just pull it out and plug it into any USB port on the presentation computer.  The first time you plug it into a new computer it can take 2-4 minutes to load the driver before the remote will work.  The second type you plug it into the same computer it only takes about 15 seconds before the remote is active.  You do not have to bring any software with you if you're using a relatively modern PC or Mac.

The remote itself is pretty good.  It's comfortable to hold for an hour and the advance/reverse arrow keys have good tactile travel to them.  The two things I like the most about this remote are the laser button and the range.  The laser button is a nice round button that has a satisfying feel when depressed.  Its very easy to control.  I also tested this remote out in a 300 seat lecture hall that is very wide with two screens.  I like to walk around and I was able to move about on the entire presenter floor and the remote advanced my slides on the first click, every time.  I was probably anywhere from 10 to 75 ft away from the podium computer during the lecture.  What I don't like as much is the blacklit LCD timer.  The vibration alarm that goes with the timer works well, however, it can be a little more difficult than necessary to push the recessed buttons to set the time.  Additionally, the backlit LCD timer screen only stays on for maybe 20-30 seconds.  I understand the desire to conserve battery life, but I would have liked a button or switch that allows me to leave the LCD screen on for the entirety of my lecture instead of dealing with the auto-off.  That's the drop to 4-stars.  In dark rooms this hypothetical always-on backlight would be a godsend and I feel it's a missed opportunity for Canon to offer something different than the competition.

Taken together, the PR10-G is a really nice presentation remote.  My problem is that it's hard to fully recommend the PR10-G over the Logitech R800, which I have used for over a year now.  The R800's timer screen stays on the entire time, but it's not backlit.  So you do need some light around to see the Logitech.  Canon had devised something to solve this problem with the backlight, but the execution is not all the way there because I just want to quickly glance down and see my time left without trying to fumble with side buttons on the remote to turn on the light.  I also think the R800 is a little more comfortable and, as of the time of writing this review, the PR10-G is significantly more expensive than the R800.

So who should buy the PR10-G?  You should look at getting the Canon over the R800 if you go back and forth between using Keynote and Power Point and/or absolutely need very reliable long distance (>75 feet) remote communication in a big lecture hall.  For everyone else, it's a personal choice, but you should at least inspect the competition before finding the right purchase for you.",7,14.315151

2880,"I'm prompted to write a review out of utter frustration even though I do believe this is basically a good product. Here's the skinny on it and 2.5 stars of rating:

GOOD: The unit will pay for itself, no question. When it works, it works great and for my household its paid for itself in just under two weeks & some incredibly long long distance calls that had to be done from a house phone, not a cell. Not everyone lives in an area with great cell reception therefore it is sometimes necessary to make long distance calls from a good landline. That alone makes it probably worth buying. But not without a little pain. Call quality is good, not great, and you better have a fast internet connection which doesn't incur slowdowns because your calls will sound choppy. Once you get it set up, its pretty easy to use. The voicemail is pretty good, but you'll have to search the web for instructions how to use. one really cool surprise--when you get a voicemail even when your phone is off, you get an email telling you so. This is a really nice feature, because you can always check your messages from another phone without having to hook up the Magic Jack.

BAD: Its a system hog. Reminds me of Norton on crack! If you run Win XP your computer will NOT hibernate with this thing plugged in. If you run a business with your computer and often have many things open that you don't want to close at the end of the day but would rather hibernate, you can't!!... without closing it all out otherwise letting your pc run all night.  You also can't shut the thing off when its plugged in, and it will always be an open window on your computer just waiting for you to make/take calls and taking system resources. The solution is you have to Ctrl-Alt-Del to get rid of it which I find to be a poorly written piece of (?) software. Or its easier to just unplug the usb port but sometimes that causes a system crash. And then getting it working again can take several attempts and a reboot, its not just ""plug it in an go"". Oh no. Also you should note once this thing is plugged in, it will take your system at least an extra 1-2 minutes to boot up. If you plug it in other than when your system is off, its possible your pc will freeze requiring a nasty reboot.  And I find it irritating that you can't get rid of the blasted Magic Jack Window except minimizing it. you can't close it. Also, when the internet is not running at 100% speed, expect some choppy calls and poor sound. I've noticed heavy internet use and downloading while on the phone compounds the problem. oh yeah, and the magic jack software logs all your calls. I don't see a way to get rid of this. Not that this is a problem to me but to some people it might be having a list of all the numbers you called & durations available to prying eyes, etc... in the open Magic Jack window.

ALL IN ALL: I'd say get it if you make lots of long distance calls where a cell phone won't do the job. when it works it works great.  The voicemail is pretty cool & getting emails when you get a call is really nice, especially if you want to use this as a rogue back line that you don't want to check all the time, or don't want to keep plugged in. The voicemail seems to work even when the unit is not connected or your pc is off (but you can't make or receive calls when the computer is off so no 911 or emergency calls in the middle of the night unless you leave your computer and internet on 24/7!). Just realize it won't work 100% of the time and can cause a headache or two in the process.

Besides, unlike some of those ultra-expensive drawing papers, this one's low enough cost you won't visualize your hard-earned $$$ going into the trash with the paper itself.

Easy to tear out perforated are commonplace these days, but I still want to give that feature a shoutout. Best of worlds? Acid-free (in case you create something you want to keep forever), 50# white paper. The very slightly rough (try ""light tooth"") paper surface worked well for ballpoint pen, lead pencil, Crayola crayons, fine, medium, and fat Sharpies; though the sharpies bled through to the other side of the paper I was drawing on, they didn't bleed onto the next sheet. Water color markers were excellent and didn't bleed through. I haven't worked with charcoal since a few drawing classes required it, but this surface probably would be fine for charcoal, too. However, like just about all ""sketchbooks,"" this paper is too thin, the surface inappropriate for water color paints.

2887,"This is a great printer for a small, and not so small, office or home/office. Here is the quick of it:
Easy set-up, great quality, huge screen, easy to use, great scans and perfect copies, plenty of features.

Now for those who want some details:
Set-up is a snap. No problems or hang-ups. Downloading the app was easy and, unlike my old HP, i have no problems connecting and printing. It also happens to look great. Not your typical ugly looking office printer.

Scans are easy and look great. They are so easy that my kids are scanning everything. Whatever they need for school is easily saved on their flash drives and taken straight to school. I can scan documents easily and email them as needed.

Copies look great and it is sometimes VERY difficult to tell the difference between the copy and the original! The color is very good and sharp, and it does not take very long for the copy to come through. The document feeder makes it very helpful for larger jobs, and no problems with pages sticking or being picked up.

Faxes come in looking great. Nice and clean. In all of these, the document feeder is very helpful for multiple pages. It makes life so much easier. It also has plenty of paper storage for our needs.

Printing is very good. Colors are accurate and sharp. Photographs come out looking great, and so does text. Edges are sharp and really clean. Printing speed is good, even large pictures print in relatively good time. The only real limitation is the size, which will print to 8.5x11. My Epson Workforce makes huge prints. That is certainly not a deal breaker and i doubt most people will need larger prints.

The touch screen is the real treat for me. It is huge! Over 4 inches, it makes life so much easier. Wait until you see it, it will change your way of printing, especially when printing from a flash drive.

I have used some heavier stock to make some name tags, and printed envelopes as well as t-shirt transfers, and they all look great and have had no problems at all. This is a great home/office printer. We can all use it wothout a hassle and so far I have had no problems printing fom any of our devices.",41,8.608711
2888,"This product does work, but don't buy it planning to easily adjust the height.  Each individual joint has a knob that you press in to adjust the level of that segment.  Thankfully, the button/knob does have degrees on it because you'll have to make sure the other side is exactly the same or the table will not work.  It took a lot of finagling to get it to a usable height where it was balanced and would not fall and I found it no use for bed (was hoping to use after back surgery while laying) but I did end up using this on my desk to raise my laptop so I can use it while standing.  But once you get it in the right position you are not going to easily raise or lower it because if you adjust one segment you have to adjust the other segments or else the balance is off.  The pros are that it is lightweight.  There were no instructions for attaching the mouse pad to the table and I wish there had been recommended settings (degrees on the knob/buttons) to make it easier to put it in the position you're looking for without so much trial and error.  My 17 inch laptop does fit on it and overhangs the back slightly - about 1-2 inches - not enough to cause any balance issues.  It is a nice idea for a concept but it doesn't really work in practice and I definitely wouldn't buy again or recommend to anyone else unless you plan on putting it in one position and leaving it there indefinitely/permanently (and not needing to fold up for storage).

2894,"My favorite pen of all time for it's price and quality and feel.  The main reason I like this pen is the tip of the ben that fits into the outer pen bezel is a tight fit.  The clicking you get with other pens as you lift and release then press and write and hear the pen make click noises as the pen innards wiggle around is something the uni-ball 307 series has no issue with.  The tolerance is very good, but not so itight you even notice it when using the top clicker to push the pen tip out or retract it.

Grip in hand is perfect for me, the cost is perfecter 8 total, the assortment of colors being black, red, and blue with 2-each is nice.  Honestly, these pens will be lost before they run out, otherwise, this will be the last purchase of pens you make for every day writing unless you are very young or a hand writer of some sort.  The average 20 years old, if they could hold onto a pen their entire life, I do feel that they would lose it before these pends run out of ink.

I went with the 0.7mm tip.  I like the end result of a slightly smaller tip, such as a 0.5 even a 0.3-0.4, however, the smaller you go, the harder I find them to write with as it feels like the pen tip is scraping across the paper, though I do love the accurate thin lines of a 0.5.  A 0.3-0.4 would last longer, but that is such a fine tip I find they are only good on pure white paper that is plain.  Even lines, graphed, etc, and sometimes dotted pseudo graph paper can have printed lines that show up more than the 0.3-0.4 tip can write.  You end up getting lost in the lines, dots, and graph of the paper.  The 0.7 is thick enough it lays down a nice dark line.

I am not sure I would recommend these to a left handed person, though I am right handed so I can't say for sure.  If a left handed persons hand drags across the just written ink, sometimes, sometimes not, it may still be just a little wet.  All lefty's I see have permanent ink stains on their hand, so unless they have adapted some sort of arched twisted grip to prevent dragging your hand across your work, these may not be perfect for a lefty.  Don't get me wrong, they are one of the fastest ring pens I have used, and am certain you would measure time in milliseconds, though i am also certain type of paper plays a large roll.  I was using a coated stock, so the ink does not absorb into the paper, but dries on-top.  My guess is an uncoated paper would suck up the ink fast enough it would be try before the 20ms or so past before your hand/palm dragged across your work.

Order a pack and see how you like them.  The only consideration would be do you want the three color assorted pack, or to go with all one color.  Aside from that, put some thought into the size tip, if you are thinking about the size of the tip, you already are a little strange and care about pens more than 99.9999% of the world so you know what you like.

For me, it was the accuracy of the ink cartridge and it's fit into the pen case so when writing you don't have any tip wiggle at all and no constant click noise as you lift and press the pen on the paper.  You can always go to Staples and test them out, they have sample pens and test writing stations at every Staples and Office Depot I have been in.  However, Amazon is usually cheaper and has a much larger stock to pick from.  For example, Staples was out of the 0.5 tip in a 3-color assorted pack or they don't carry it since I only learned of it on Amazon.  Amazon is marginally less in cost if you go with free shipping, and really, you will be ok with no pen for an extra 2 days.  Unless you have Amazon Prime, or spend over a certain amount, in which case you can sometimes upgrade your free shipping to a faster method without any additional charge.  Then again, if you need a sun $20 set of pens by tomorrow, I would suggest a  hobby that doesn't involve pens.  Let it take 5 days to get you, it will give you a chance to play with that calligraphy set you bough 4 years ago and never even cracked open. :)

Calligraphy pens are a good example of a pen that has one feature I like that this pen mimics.  Calligraphy pens can't have tip wiggle.  They can and do drag and scrape across the paper, a sound I am sure you have heard before, or could find on youtube by searching for Calligraphy.  On a day to day pen, the mm tip size is what will define that, with the smaller you go, the more scrape you are going to get as well as the less ink coverage and density.  Test out a 0.7, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.  For me, the 0.5 is just a hair too light in coverage and s hair too scratchy.  The 0.7 is a hair too thick, and not scratchy at all. By too thick I just mean it is my personal upper limit.

Ideally, I would use a 0.6, though I don't believe uni-ball has them in this series pen.  If a 0.5 is too small/light/scratchy by 15% and the 0.7 is a bit too thick for my perfect pen, then a 0.6 should be ideal.  I raillery see them in that size, there seems to be 1.0, 0.7, 0.5, 0.2 and that is it.

Give em a shot, if you hate them, return them.  Writing is a very personal experience.  Test them out at Staples and Office Depot, as well as Target sometimes too.  These are a fairly mainstream pen and well stocked almost everywhere.  I used to be a Pentel man, but the uni-ball won me over. Perhaps it was the uni-ball pen testing stations that had a fat ream of paper and a slot to discard your tests tat won me over, but I like them better than my favorite Pentel of past.

I have been unable to determine what the 307 series means, as there were other series, all ending on 07, perhaps it is the pen style, I didn't look very hard to answer that question. I think the 07 is their Gel series, and the 2xx and 3xx, which are the only others I saw relates to the size of the pen.  Since the tip is measures in mm, that really only leaves type and size left.

Enjoy your new pens, which are going for around 50% of what the brick and mortars are charging for the 8-pack of 2 res, 3, blues, and 3 blacks.  It is so nice to have blue and red around.  Especially red. Develop a system for what you use different colors for, and never deviate from it, mainly stick to red and blue/black as the blue and black can at times with other pens be too close to tell, which I suppose is why there is a color called ""blue/black"".  This kit, the blue is pretty distinguishable, though in no way is it the color blue you see the pen top representing in the picture.  It is not blue/back, but it sure as heck is not black by anyone's possible definition. I still would just develop a red and blue/black-blue-black 2 color system for daily use, two is plenty, if you needed more, I suggest you use the pen to take a note about those rare cases.  It probably is why there are 3 black pens and only 2 of the colored ones.

2896,"After trying a variety of small, handheld manual sharpeners--including an official ""Prismacolor"" ellipse sharpener that looks nearly identical to the Kum (and which I just found out was actually made by Kum)--I had pretty much given up on these things and relied mostly on my trusty electric pencil sharpener.  Most tiny sharpeners at best could freshen up a dull point, but if the lead actually broke (or you needed to sharpen a new pencil), they pretty much would shave off wood or chew up ends without giving a decent and even point. If I had known at the time that Kum had also made my Prismacolor sharpener, I wouldn't have ordered it! Boy, am I glad I had no clue! Perhaps the German company has improved blade making or something, because this little sharpener really works with just a few turns. I haven't had to sharpen a flat-ended new pencil, but I am confident that it could do the job if needed. I really wanted to have a small PORTABLE sharpener that could fit into a pencil case slot or purse without causing too much bulk, and also have a compartment for shavings. While the compartment is quite small, it will still do to sharpen a few pencils neatly until the compartment could be emptied.  If the sharpener becomes dull with use (I literally have HUNDREDS of pencils), I will definitely re-order this sharpener again, or try the replacement blades the company makes if they make them for this model.  I don't have any large pencils, so just a one-hole sharpener is all I need.",3,9.82952

In fact, right out the box it feels wonderful in your hands, it's soft and pliable.

I'm not sure how I feel about the 3 mini notebooks. I know that is what I expected from the images, but it feels a bit sloppy. The 3 notebooks never line up, and it feels less like a book than it does a collection of three smaller books. The pro to this con is that you can easily segment your writings into 3 sections using the 3 books.

The paper has a nice soft feel to it. It's a bit thinner than I expected, and some dark pens can be seen through the paper, so writing on both sides is not always an option for all pens. Pencil? No problem, use both sides.

2903,"This scanner is amazing!  Using it, I have digitized three full file cabinet drawers of personal papers in fairly short order, and sold the unnecessary file cabinet!

Others have already written about the fantastic speed, the simultaneous scanning of front and back sides, and the great value of getting a full version of Adobe Acrobat included.  What I haven't seen mentioned are a few of the scanner's quirks.  To be clear, these quirks do not detract from the scanner's performance enough to justify anything less than a 5-star review, because this scanner is fantastic.

Auto Color Detection:  By default, the scanner will detect whether a document should be saved in B&W, grayscale, or color.  Usually, it makes its decision correctly, but not quite often enough for me to rely on it.  When I was scanning a large stack of credit card statements, it would have a hard time determining whether the small amount of color in the company logo at the top of the page justified color scanning - about half of the documents it determined should be color, and half grayscale.  Less often, it selects B&W when grayscale would be more appropriate.  Unfortunately, this feature means you either have to spend the time to change scanning profiles depending on whether you want color or not, or just accept the seemingly arbitrary decision-making of the scanner.

Auto Quality Detection:  Similar to the color detection above, the scanner will, by default, attempt to determine which of three quality levels to use when scanning documents.  Given the very efficient PDF compression, this is an easy fix for me, as I just configure it to scan in high quality all the time.  Occasionally, for special archival needs, I may up the quality to the highest setting (which the scanner will not select when using auto quality detection), but this is probably overkill for really any document.

Snow leopard:&nbsp;&nbsp;As of 11/16, Fujitsu has released updated drivers for Snow Leopard that actually restore functionality to the full scan snap manager suite.&nbsp;

Other than those issues, I can't imagine how you would design a better document scanner.

2908,"This printer is a 5-star value within its category of inexpensive printers.  It is so impressive how much functionality is offered at this price. I've been using a similarly-priced Canon all-in-one wireless printer and was happy with it, but this Epson is faster, has more features (double-sided printing for one), and has far better on-printer controls and displays.  My needs are those of a light-duty home office printer, where I print or copy a few pages a day, and the printer meets all my needs.

Setup was easy.  After I powered it up the first time, it found my existing wireless network and I simply entered the WEP password via the front panel display and keypad. No need to hook up USB cables for setup.  You need to install the Epson driver software (from the provided CD or by downloading it) onto each computer from which you want to use the printer and this is straightforward and takes about 15 minutes per computer.  After completing the first driver installation on my first computer, the driver informed me it was downloading and installing new printer firmware onto the printer, and that took about 10 minutes but completed without any glitches.  What I don't understand is why, when installing the driver on additional computers in my home, it repeated this lengthy firmware download and install when it was already done the first time.  Oh well.

I haven't printed any photos, so I can't comment on that, but I've printed a lot of b/w and color pages and made some copies (using the enlarging feature) and have no negative things to say about the printer.  Things I like: 1) the blank paper lies flat in a tray (rather than curling up in a vertical paper feed like on my Canon);  2) the 3"" color LCD display and keypad enables lots of easy-to-use control right on the printer; 3) text pages are printed quickly, taking about 4 seconds to print a pageful of b/w text; 4) three separate color ink cartridges (plus a black cartridge) should be more economical especially if you tend to print a lot of one color.

Another reviewer complained about cheap plastic, and yeah there's a lot of lightweight plastic but it makes no difference in the functionality and quality of the things that are important, and it keeps the device inexpensive.

I used it for years  and one day it was gone. I bought several on Amazon so I would have one wherever I went.  They are expensive as everyday ballpoint pens go, and will not get the attention of a Cross, Mt Blanc or Waterman. However, they are solid metal, durable pens with a great rolling feel and a uniquely subtle click mechanism.  They are a tool of expression for those who use their hand to reveal themselves.",2,4.9851213
2914,"We are now going on two years with our Ooma (also bought one for my in-laws and they love it too). We have a very fast cable internet connection, and I couldn't figure out why I was still paying the phone company. We plugged the device into our home network, registered, and ported our number, that did take a few days to finalize and we have been going strong ever since. We did pay a bit extra for the upgraded package, this works out to around $13 a month. Call quality is excellent, at least as good as the phone company. We would highly recommend this to anyone, so long as you have a reliable internet connection. One weird thing that I noticed, when you answer the phone there is just an ever so slightly long delay before the person can hear you. I usually say ""hello"" twice, they hear me the second time. After that there is never any perceptible delay that I have ever noticed. The voice mail feature is outstanding and you can have it forward voicemails to your cel phone, e-mail, etc.

The Great:
-Call Quality is Excellent
-You can use all of your old phones and wiring
-It is MUCH CHEAPER than the phone company
-Call forwarding
-You can take the device with you and plug it in to any network (My in-laws do this multiple times per year)

The Not So Great:
-You really need a decently fast and reliable internet connection
-Short delay on beginning of a call
-You probably need a bit of networking knowledge to make the install go easy",6,6.2056675
2915,"I do a lot of inking and, as such, have a myriad of pens. To give you some background, I have: two Rotring Rapidograph College Sets, 4 Pilot Parallel Pens, the full line of Copic Multiliner SP, a Pentel Pocket Brush and Large Brush Pen, a Rotring Variant Varioscript set from the 60s and a box of Microns somewhere.

I've always liked the reliability and build quality of the Rotrings, but they can be a hassle to clean, so my go-to pens are typically the Multiliner SP and the Pentel Pocket Brush. I have a standard crow quill that I use occasionally, but I'm lazy so I don't get it, and the ink well, out as much as I should. I recently stumbled upon this and decided to give it a try. It lives up to my expectations and the Rotring name. As other reviews have mentioned, it takes a bit to break in. Apply some pressure to get those thick blacks and soon the tension on the tip will ease up a bit. I love the versatility of it. It's like having several technical pens in one. I no longer have to bring a handful of multiliners with me on the go. I grab the ArtPen and my Pentel Pocket Brush and I'm set. As another reviewer mentioned, you can flip the pen over to get finer lines (brilliant suggestion!). It's lightweight but solid and easy to throw in your backpack or pocket.

Ink is the nice deep blacks I expect from Rotring. You can buy the cartridge refills or the inkwell converter. I opted for the converter as it's cheaper and less wasteful. The pen comes with two cartridges so you have some time to decided. Cartridge longevity is impressive. You can put Rotring ink in the converter or buy your favorite brand and use it. Absolutely in love with the pen!",13,7.454076

2919,"I don't get why this is being rated highly... it has noticeably bad paper. Not fountain-pen friendly in the slightest, it is very thin and slick paper, which makes smearing, blotting, and bleed-through unavoidable. Even when the ink doesn't bleed through the page, the paper is so thin that whatever is written on the front is legible from the back. Paired with their cheap and flimsy cardboard covers, awful ""lay-any-way-but-flat"" staple bindings, and general lack of quality, this makes for a pretty awful notebook. Am currently looking for alternatives in this same size.",3,5.7711086
2920,"I love these highlighters, if they came in green, blue and purple as well I wouldn't buy anything else.  However, I still gave them a four for a few reasons, the color selection being one, and a few other quirks that make them not perfect for everyone.  They are unusual.  They write like soft, translucent crayons, which means you will not always get precision lines or consistent markings.  Once you get used to how you have to angle and adjust though, they are wonderful.  They do not bleed through, at all, ever.  And once completely dry they do not smear or remain sticky.  But, as others have said, they have the potential to transfer from one page to the adjacent one when the book is closed.  If you are more light-handed, that would not be a problem, but if like me you are a ferocious highlighter then the same thing happens that would with crayons, you leave small wax residue spots that may squish onto the next page when the book is closed.  Again, this can be avoided with certain technique and care, but it doesn't bother me enough to waste my time thinking about on a day to day basis.  They last reasonably long, though again this will depend on how much pressure you apply when you highlight.  For me personally, the pink is too dark, I feel if it were a little more translucent or lighter in color it would be a more usable pen.  Hope this helps those of you, like me, who know way too much about highlighters, and go through more than you'd care to admit in a semester.  Man, medical school makes you geeky...",14,7.876448

2923,"I am so busy and have so many things going on at one time, it can be overwhelming.  I work from home on my laptop.  All day I have to keep moving devices and supplies around my work area.  I was excited to see if there was a tool that could take care of all my needs in one spot.

I really like the look and overall feel of this.  The number of spots that hold all my devices in one place is my favorite part.  Its a strong construction with a softer bean bag bottom.  I slide the top half open and put my tablet and phone on the right.  As Im typing this, I look to the right to read my emails and texts without having to move anything!  I even keep my protein bars (no judging) and portable chargers in the space underneath my computer.  When I have to be in a narrower space, I just lay the devices down and slide the top closed.

The only thing I wish it had some edge cushion for the wrists.

While the paper seems good and suits the purpose, I cant even imagine the thought process that decided wrapping 20 pounds of loose paper in plastic wrap and a plastic cord and shipping it like that that, was ever a good thing. All of my other shipments for packing paper come in a long thin box, that allows you to pull sheet by sheet out. This shipment forces you to cut the plastic and tie off to access the paper, leaving you with a heap of paper that constantly wants to S curl back in on itself and no way to contain it. It won't lie flat since it was folded in half and in half again, and tied tightly, so its just flopping around uselessly. Irritating.",8,6.1822963
2928,"I was looking for mailers like these to send out books as gifts and for reviews. These mailers were among the least expensive I've seen searching online, and the free shipping make them a real bargain. Usually, it is the shipping costs that drive the costs of mailers and boxes way up. The product arrived quickly and in good condition, and I have absolutely no complaints with the transaction.

It's worth mentioning that the mailers will arrive flat and you have to fold them around the book (or whatever you are sending). The mailer is designed to adjust to books of different thickness, so depending on thickness of your book, the box you create may not have perfectly aligned edges. This was fine for my needs.",3,7.5295095
2929,"Color quality is unbelievable. This printer replaced an HP Photosmart All-in-one top of the line model that I thought printed excellent photos, but I was floored when I saw these photos. They are simply gorgeous!! the inks are much more vibrant than the HP inks and there is a depth to the color that I haven't seen before in an ink jet printer.  That said, in a Mac environment, we are having some issues with the sizes of photos that are printing out.  Epson gets it wrong sometimes... and tends to print about -"" larger than what you are expecting if you print from Photos, ON1  or Apeture.  Scan quality and speed is excellent when you use the included EpsonScan  app.... not quite as perfect if you are using Image Capture or other apps that use Mac's built in capability, but often has a slight skew no matter how squared against the rules the original is placed.  (In some instances, the scan is almost too sensitive... will  pick up the slight shadow under a small scratch in a photo that's invisible to the naked eye!)  Inks are gorgeous, but run out ore quickly than the HP printers and are more expensive.",3,13.740934
2930,"I'm disappointed, this looked like a nice slim model and was a great price. Looked and felt nice out of the box too, but it doesn't work. Before I even tried to use it there was a loud abnormal sounding clicking noise as it warmed up, but I tried it anyway. The rollers didn't seem to be moving and it would not feed a 3mil pouch no matter how carefully/gently/assertively/etc I tried. I pulled out several destroyed sheets that had melted and curled from being pressed against an unmoving hot roller. The bottom plastic also got *very hot* and I was nervous about my desk getting burned from it sitting so low on the desk surface. So apparently it's defective. I realize defects happen, but I don't think I dare try another one from this maker. I'm going to choose a more familiar brand for a few extra bucks. Too bad.

*Update*: After seeing the manufacturer's comment below in response to my review, I emailed them immediately as they requested. I explained that I had already prepared the laminator to return to Amazon and I wasn't sure if there was anything they could do. I never received a reply - only the comment you see here. Just an FYI in case anyone reads their comment and wondered what happened.

**Second Update**: April 27th 2014: Eventually the manufacturer replaced this with an upgraded model at no charge to me. But having said that; the contact during this replacement process was sporadic and awful; First they didn't reply to my email as mentioned in the above update for a couple of weeks. Then they finally emailed back to say I can use the ""enclosed link"" to choose a new model at no charge - but neglected to include a link to the models I could choose from. I immediately (same day) emailed them back to tell them they forgot the link and to ask what my choices were. I didn't hear from them again until a MONTH later, when totally out of the blue they sent a link of the model choices as if an entire month hadn't passed. I didn't dare go with the same flat plastic type because the first one was junk, so I chose the next one up, the cheapest model that wasn't plastic. While it was a more expensive unit and therefore technically an upgrade, I find that I never use it because it's a very large & heavy steel industrial-type model that really isn't suitable or convenient for limited home use and space. Then to top it all off they emailed me more than once within just a week of my replacement wanting me to hurry up and delete/change this review which really annoyed me since I waited SO long for them to replace it. Seems they took their time getting back to me when it was me waiting for my product to be replaced, yet they were very consistent/persistent with emails when it was their turn to wait for my review to be updated.

So yes, they eventually upgraded my model at no charge to ""make things right"", but their contact in doing so was so sporadic and delayed that it took them nearly *A MONTH AND A HALF* in total to finally replace the unit. All they really did was add to my frustration, as I waited and waited, unsure whether or not I should just buy a different brand but wanting to see if they were going to ever going to follow through on their offer of a replacement. The whole experience was extremely frustrating from a company supposedly trying to ""make things right"". I know I'm expected to give a glowing review now because they replaced and upgraded my item, but free or not, it honestly wasn't worth the hassle and the massive delay in waiting for it. However well-intentioned they might be, their service is just as defective as the original product was.",2,8.083139
2931,"I was pleasantly surprised by these mailers, and realized that a lot of products that I purchase are mailed in these exact type of bags. Previously I was working primarily with kraft paper mailers, because I liked how thick and rigid they were. However, I realized that I needed something waterproof, so I went with a single order of 50 of these mailers before I bought several hundred.

I was actually impressed by the quality, and the fact that these are way better looking in person than they look online. I was afraid they were going to be really soft and thin, but they aren't at all. They have a nice soft feel in your hands, but they are quite tough and rigid for being a soft bubble mailer. They aren't floppy at all, and I can actually fit more inside of these than I can with the 4x8 kraft mailers.

The only downside to these is the fact that they are textured on the outside with little circles. I stamp the outsides of my packages, and the circle patterns interfere with my stamps. Nonetheless, this is a great buy for the price.",5,5.8025384
2932,"Mac users: This works painlessly with Tiger. Even the scanning software works well. You won't get that from most other companies.

Everyone: One of the best features is that the print nozzles can be replaced, and there's a dust cover when not in use. All ink jet printers clog really easily if exposed to dust, giving white streaks across the printout. The built in dust cover (the paper door flips up to cover the opening) has prevented this from happening even in a fairly dusty environment. Even better, if it ever *does* clog up, the ink jet nozzles are attached to a replaceable snap-in platform, so the printer can be restored in no time at all. Most other ink jet printers have permanent nozzles, or the nozzles are replaced with every single ink cartridge making the cartridges way more expensive.",21,6.9073033
2933,"The Epson C60 prints great. No matter what paper you use the quality is the same, excellent. It is very fast. And I also like the price....
  Here's the problem...the Epson C60 is a real ink guzzler. The ink runs out way too fast. The printer has an ink monitor and when you put in a cartridge (black or color) the monitor says it's full. However, when you print a one page document, the monitors ink level is at 3/4 full, what's that?
  I would have gave his printer 4 or 5 stars but the ink situation is bothering me. The printer is reasonably priced but with the amount of ink cartridges you will have to buy, the printer will end up causing you alot in the long run.",6,8.825808
2934,"Anyone who has a laser printer at home, knows how much it costs to replace the ink cartridges in them, whether you are replacing the black and white cartridge or the color cartridge. In the past, I have only used HP cartridges because I thought that was the only choice that I had. You can imagine how happy I became when I came across this package deal which offered me a black and white ink cartridge and a color ink cartridge, which fits into my HP printer/scanner. With a teenage student in the house, we do a lot of printing for school, and this will help save us quite a bit of money. These refurbished cartridges are less than half the price of the original HP products. They snapped right into place in the printer and worked just like they were supposed to, in other words they worked just like the original HP ink cartridges. Now, I can only hope that they will continue to work as well and as long as the original HP ink cartridges, only time will tell. If they do not, or if they leak or have some other defect, I will do an addendum to this review and update anyone else who might consider purchasing this product. That being said, at this time, after initial install of the ink cartridges, they are working just as they should.

It's impossible to notice with more than two insert, and I've only found it to be irritating on the last few pages if you only have a single insert.

The sizing of the notebook has also been brought up as a problem. My solution is to use a rotary cutter to adjust 3.5 x 5.5 notebooks until they match the Midori insert dimensions.

Lastly, I found that there is no need to purchase the connection bands. I bought them, but was using a No. 64 rubber band from Wal-Mart before they arrived. After switching, I notice no difference.

Overall, I'm glad I got this notebook. I'm giving the notebook a 4 star because I feel that the leather cover and one insert is an inadequate representation of what the product offers.

2940,"I've been fighting an HP all-in-one for years, replacing ink a lot more frequently than I thought was reasonable. Years ago I thought a monochrome laser would be good as a home printer, but when I looked (at the time) they were a couple hundred bucks and no wi-fi. So I scrapped that idea and have just been hating on my HP all this time.

Well, enter this little gem! All the reviews I could find (Amazon, CNET, others) seemed to be overwhelmingly positive. For $100, why not?  It's as good as everyone says! Seems to have a better-than-average build quality and setup was a breeze, even with just the one-line LCD display. I had it up and running in about 15 minutes and then printing from my iPhone about 10 minutes after that. Print quality is good and it's fast.

2950,"Befor receiving this headrest I was very skeptical about the value of this headrest.  The price seemed exorbitant but I was intrigued because of the good reviews and the apparent adjustability of the the headrest.  I figured that I would have nothing to lose by trying one given Amazon's great customer service and dedication to customer satisfaction, if it didn't work out I could return it.  I was to be very pleasantly surprised.

Upon receiving the unit I found it very easy to center and install.  The position adjustments (2 swivel points and 1 height adjustment) for the headrest are great. There are two pivot points and one elevation adjustment. By combining these 3 adjustments in various settings it is relatively easy to find comfortable settings for different purposes.  For example, by using the lowest pivot the headrest can be moved forward to meet your head or neck while sitting upright while computing, etc.  For a more laid back setting while reclining the lower pivot can be used to pull the headrest rearward.  The other two adjustments can make compensatory adjustments to keep the headrest at a comfortable angle.

I must say the designer of this unit hit it out of the park as I can get adjustments for any purpose sitting upright or reclining. The appearance matches the chair perfectly and makes the chair look more complete, modern and exotic. The build quality of the headrest is equal to the build quality of the Aeron Chair itself.  This is the missing link that kept me from getting the greatest possible comfort and enjoyment from my Aeron Chair.  I am well into my tenth year of owning my chair and I have enjoyed the chair itself from day one.  I suffer from spondylolisthesis at L5 (bad lower back) and this chair has been a real benefit for my back.

Now, with the addition of this headrest, I have to say that my Aeron chair is virtually perfect for my needs.  I wish it had been an option 10 years ago I had no idea what I have been missing.  I would never and could never do without this wonderful addition.  And I am glad I didn't waste time with the cheaper model sold here at Amazon, 1) It lacks the adjustability of this unit and 2) It doesn't match the overall look right down to the pellicle fabric.  This headrest complements and finishes the Aeron Chair perfectly.  This headrest is worth every penny.  I just wish I had been able to get one with the chair when I first got it.

One important note: The included instructions are very short and lacking in detailed information.  For example, there is no information about adjusting tension at the two pivot points which is an important feature possible with this unit. I emailed Vendor Gear and got their Website address and found some very valuable videos and instructions for adjusting the tension and positioning of the headrest.  Here is the link for their Website: aeronheadrest dot com and of course, take out the spaces and replace the word ""dot"" with a "".""  (evidently URL's are automatically removed from reviews but this URL is of critical importance to anyone buying this wonderful accessory)

Finally, to sum up, this is a fantastic addition to a great chair and worth every penny.

Update 10/10/12:  Oddly, my lower back is loving the headrest as well. I suspect that due to the addition of the headrest I have improved my sitting posture to the point that I am feeling the full benefit and support of the Aeron chair.  This item continues to impress me with its value.

2951,"Ink cartridges for this printer have a chip on them so Epson can control whether you use their cartridges or not.  That sucks but I'll leave that argument for another time.  I bought GENUINE Epson cartridges for this print so I wouldn't have a problem, right?  WRONG.  The printer won't even recognize genuine Epson Cartridges.  If you run out of ink in any one cartridge, the printer freezes up and won't do anything but beep.  You install a new cartridge and if the printer doesn't recognize it, for whatever reason, your printer remains frozen. PERIOD.  You can't do anything at all with it.  I called Epson support and was on hold for 45 minutes and never did talk to a real person.  This is unacceptable.  Epson Products are NOT WORTH using if you lose days of productivity because the printer won't recognize a genuine Epson ink cartridge.

2953,"The largest problem facing the Palm OS world is satisfying the users who demand color AND room for apps AND long battery life AND simplicity.  The 515 does a pretty good job of balancing these issues and produces a serviceable handheld, but it still falls short for power users.
The 515's color display is a big jump compared to the 505, but only having 160 x 160 pixels really limits the device.  I'm getting older and Palm's shrinking displays are getting tougher to deal with.  The larger display on the Pocket PCs are much easier to deal with.  However, this (and the battery life) is the only real gripe I have with the 515.
With 16mb of RAM on board, it has plently of room for apps and data, so much so that I have never really needed to use the SD expansion.  It runs fast, and does everything one would want a Palm to do.  The Palm OS is still far superior to Pocket PC for contact management, todo lists and appointments but users who are heavily reliant upon Outlook may want to look at the cheaper Pocket PC models (Toshiba especially) as they are still a better fit for Outlook users at almost the same price.
Finally, it seems to me that the battery just doesn't last as long in the 515 as it did in the 505, the price one pays for being able to read the screen.  This is only a minor issue but it can be annoying at times.",40,10.294683

It does not eat batteries which is another nice feature. The shavings cup is fiddly to get off but if you train the child to hold the sharpener well into the trash can while opening it there should be no disasters.

Not only does it look very unprofessional, it also is very time consuming.  During the start of the project the diagrams are changing all the time.

This printer allows me to print all my diagrams on one page. This printer prints up to 13"" x 19"" and it prints that large at photo quality.  It is awesome.

2976,"This is a decent slide scanner, but it takes some work for good scans.

First, you need to pre-sort your slides and group by exposure.  Sunny, bright slides in one stack, dark slides in an other and mixed in another.  The scanner lets you adjust brightness and color - but to constantly change this is a pain.  If you pre-sort, you can adjust once per set.

Next - slides MUST be clean. Have a soft brush and a blower handy. Slides are crud and dust magnets, and they'll deposit this stuff in the scanner.  I scanner 50 slides before I realized an eyelash wound up on the scanner light.

Clean the scanner every few scans - you can turn the scanner on so the screen shows you any dirt or crud.  The included cleaning tool works well, but I sound I also have to use a blower.

This is the nature of slide scanning - that's why scanning services charge so much. And you still get crud in the images. I've paid 50 cents and $1.50 per scan. The results are not much better than this scanner does.

It's intuitive to use, and scans to an SD card or the computer.  I found that the SD card needed to be formatted by the device in order to work - otherwise it won't save the image.

2980,"This is the first laminator I have ever used, so I don't have the benefit of comparison. I ordered it from Amazon for about $20. I am using it to make bench cards and tags (informational tags) for plants at my greenhouse. My first impressions are good....
-- Plastic housing is sleek and simple.
-- Not to bulky.
-- Comes in a small box that is barely larger than the device. Which I think is cool, cuz this will go back in the box after use to keep the cat hair out. It does not like laminating cat hair.
-- Heats up quickly. I did not feel like I was waiting around to use it.
-- Laminates 7 lineal inches in 38 seconds.

I was using 5Mil Scotch 3M pouches. 5 x 7 size. I laminated laser printed, normal weight printer paper. I placed 2 pouches side by side and fed them through. The pouches laminated long-way in 38 seconds. The first run or two left the laminate a little hazy  (not sure if the haze is a brand issue or a laminator issue). So I ran those through again. The effect was cleared. After running the machine for 3-5 laminations of the same size, the lamination was clear first time through.

One set of laminations, I did not remove immediately from the machine as it spit them out. The edge that was sitting closest to the heat of the laminator was distorted. I waited for the lamination to cool, ran it through a second time, and removed it immediately. This resolved the wavy edge.

I don't know if any laminator makes noise while running, but this is as silent as the grave. There isn't ANY sound whatsoever. I ran almost 40 laminations one after the other. It was consistent after the 3rd set. I even tried two partial papers in a 5 x 7 pouch, and it laminated around them very well. I will be able to cut them apart without issue.

2988,"Once upon a time, you could easily purchase a copy machine or a computer printer, but over the years the two have become very much the same device, and while there still remain products that are only printers, all the copiers appear to also function as a computer printer as well.

Let's talk about the copy machine aspects first, since that may be your main reason for buying this unit. First off all, the 5600 has a small footprint, not much larger than the paper that it holds at its base, its copy head being larger than the base so as to permit routine scans of larger items. The speed of this unit is quite fast - faster than the equivalently priced unit from Canon, and faster than the vast majority of printers from Canon and HP. So if you want 50 copies of a poster to put up around the neighborhood, this unit is perfect. The base also holds a larger supply of paper than the equivalent unit from Canon, so again this unit is a winner. Note that there are times during operation when the 5600 will briefly pull a little more than 15 amps, so depending on what else is on your power line, you may find that this needs to be plugged in to a separate circuit. The top panel provides a color touch-screen interface that works intuitively and quickly, allowing you to wake it from sleep and begin the copying process just about immediately.

Importantly (*****), note that the 5600's ADF is not capable of duplex scanning or copying. This isn't evident in Brother's promotional materials, and it took a while to find even in the manual that the 5600 cannot handle two-sided scanning. You can make two sided copies, however, so going from one sided to two-sided IS possible. And you can manually go from two-sided to two-sided; you just can't do it with a stack of paper piled into the ADF.

Copies are predictably high quality and I had no problem with paper feed or other mechanical components. The overall build quality is excellent, so no complaints there either.

Now let's look at the printing: I hooked my unit up via the Ethernet port to my Mac Pro running 10.11.5. Although the printer connected perfectly to my Mac locally, it would not connect to the Internet. I'm sure that if I spent a few hours trying to figure out where the problem was in terms of how to make the network work perfectly, I'd have gotten this going, but this needs to be more intuitive. I even unplugged the unit and plugged it into my Airport router directly to see if that would allow it to have internet access. Nope, still didn't work as advertised. I suspect I'd need to go directly into my Verizon FIOS router, but that just wouldn't be very convenient given where that's located in my home. So I went back to having the printer near my computer, now hooking it up with the USB cable. Eventually, using Brother's software, I managed to upgrade the firmware from 1.06 (the shipping version) to 1.08. Installation of Brother's software was necessary for the unit to print from my computer and scan to my computer correctly, but that was easy and quick.

Unlike my usual printer, a Canon dedicated laser printer, the Brother wakes up from sleep as soon as a print order is sent. So if I want to print one page, I do so, walk around to the back of my desk to fetch the printed page and by the time I get there, the page has been printed - even if I haven't used the printer for many hours. It's even faster if it was recently used. I've had no problems with printing or scanning, and there are all kinds of special abilities such as scanning directly to a flash drive, using a special feed mechanism for envelopes, and so forth, all of which work well.

Ultimately, this is a very nicely designed copier/printer, the first such unit I've seen where the printer capabilities rival those of dedicated printers. Be aware that this particular unit does not have faxing ability and does not have a duplex-capable ADF. If those issues are not of concern, then you will do quite well with this printer. I do think that Brother could upgrade their Mac interface to make connection to the internet more easily established without requiring a call to your local IT guru. That said, I'm impressed that Brother has designed the unit so that even while asleep, a print command wakes it up (my Canon requires me to physically push a button to wake it so that it will then detect the print order).",7,14.476488

It is lightweight, yet sturdy enough to use in your favorite chair or even bed!  I am disabled and color to help with pain control, as well as keeping my mind busy.  Thank you Mr Richeson for such an awesome product!  I am contemplating how to decorate my boards.  Amazon.... Please make these boards more accessible to all of my fellow colorists!

The scale tray is protected by a plastic, hinged, lid that snaps shut.

The scale is powered by 2-AAA batteries. I much prefer AAA or AA batteries over button cell batteries that many of these small scales use (such as CR2032.)  You can use rechargeable AAA batteries in this scale if you wish; button cells, like CR2032 are not rechargeable.

The weighing platform (3"" x 2.5"") is on the left, roughly 2/3  of the total scale width and on the right side is a LCD backlit display and the 3 function buttons (on/off, mode, tare.)

Tare is a function that lets you zero out the weight of a container placed on the weighing platform prior to placing the item(s) you want to weigh into the container. When you place the container, sans items, onto the platform, hitting the ""Tare"" button zeros out the weight so only the item weight is displayed once you place the items into the container.

The Mode button cycles through the different modes: grams (g), ounces (oz), troy ounce (ozt) and pennyweight (dwt.) The scale has an accuracy of 0.1g.

It is possible to recalibrate the scale but not necessarily convenient to do so unless you happen to have a 500gram reference weight around. I don't have one, so I did not attempt to calibrate my scale. As can be seen in my video review, the scale was off by 2/100th of a troy ounce when weighing a silver dollar which should weigh exactly 1 troy ounce. The scale indicated a weight of 1.02 troy oz, so it was off by .02 ozt. Several factors can affect weighing accuracy... temperature, whether the scale is perfectly level, whether the scale is out of calibration or even drafts in the room.

The warranty is generous... 10 years.

I like this little scale. It's useful for weighing small items and doesn't take up much space.

I was provided a sample for review.",16,14.512901
2995,you use Canon paper. I just replaced my old Epson600 since it never would print color well with Windows XP. This Canon blew me away when I used the Canon Photo Paper Plus (mid range glossy). An 8.5 x 11 picture from my Canon A40 (only 2 mp) is indistinquishable from a photolab film print. There is zero pixelation even under a magnifying glass. So do NOT believe the ususal reviews that say a 2 mp camera is OK only for medium quality 5x7 printing. The quality of prints on other brands of paper is mediocre so only use the Canon paper. I bought some cheap other brand glossy 4x6 paper and the results were not very good. Colors were fine but there was pixelation. The fact that this printer has 6 tanks solves the problem of cheaper printers. Refills are not costly if you know where to get them. Canon printers were good years ago and then Epson took the lead in color printing. Now Canon has come back strong with a real winner.,5,8.681715

Operation is simple enough, no display, but a simple set of buttons control the various features. Ink replacements are $50, and the printer is $69 (with a starter ink set), so I can definitely see people just buying another printer next time it goes on sale to save on ink.

Prints are specified to come out in 22 seconds, and in my tests that sounds about right. Two of the best features are a fast startup time (ready to print in about 7 seconds, compared to around 35 on my Epson) and quiet operation - much quieter than my Epson or laser.

Print quality is good - on good paper and photos look fantastic - albeit slow to print. On average, my 4x6 photos take about a minute to print. Despite the low price, it also comes with a pretty decent easy exchange warranty, quite nice of Canon.

3010,"I received these at my front door 2 days after ordering them with free Prime shipping. They arrived in flawless condition. $9.99 for 25 Smead File Folders seemed like a great deal to me. It would be difficult to find an equitable purchase at an office supply store.

COLOR | The Jewel Toned Collection includes 5 assorted colors (5 colors x 5 folders of each = 25 folders total). I found each color to be appealing. They're attractive without being overly feminine/masculine or attached to a particular theme/season. In other words, they're colorfully neutral, Lol!

FILE MATERIAL | The papers stock is of satisfactory quality. I gauge it to be thick enough to meet the demands of normal to heavy filing use. It's sturdy enough to maintain its shape. Personally, mine all arrived without any flaws such as scuff marks or wrinkles.

HANGERS | The hangers remain stationary in the folders... They do NOT slide around. In regards to holding up the folders, I found that they work well on bars within a desk drawer designed for hanging as well as mobile hanging file containers.

BOX | When I received these folders, they were contained in the manufacture's original packaging. A shipping box enclosed it, and air pocket wrapping helped keep it protected.

TABS | Here's where my review gets heavy... I am NOT impressed with the tabs or the labels. The tabs are made from extremely thin plastic. The plastic is translucent, which I happen to prefer much more over coordinating the color with the file (as it makes the label writing difficult to see). They're functional but very flimsy. Exactly 25 tabs came with the box... I feel that there should ALWAYS be a couple extras included. After all, without a tab/way to label them, these folders are virtually useless, so give the customer a little cushion! (**HINT HINT Smead.**) Judging from the low quality, I can't imagine that it would cost much to add a few extra backups in.

LABELS | Perhaps even worse than the tabs are the labels. In my experience, file folder labels are made from a long strip (or a few shorter strips) of thick card-stock that contains perforated lines for easy detachment via manual tearing. This was not the case here...... Just like the tabs, the 3 included label strips were low quality and flimsy. They didn't tear easily. Upon being detached, most of the labels had a ""furry"" edge (from the not-so-clean tear). It took more time than I anticipated to carefully tear apart each label out of concern for ruining the paper strip. The one positive aspect to mention about this area is that the paper strips did include enough material to create approximately 3 extra labels (back to my point about giving the customer a little cushioning)... So you have 3 times to mess up your labels before having to find alternative materials.

FUNCTION | Although detaching the labels was a pain, inserting them into the tabs and then installing the combined components into the folders was a breeze. There are precisely enough slots to designate a position to each color without overlap (5 positions for 5 colors). I'm not sure if that was planned intentionally or its just how all Smead Filing Folders are designed... But it worked out perfectly! 25 folders also seem to be the ideal quantity to fill most filing drawers. The entire set fits great in my desk drawer and also work perfectly with my mobile hanging filing container that chills on my desktop.

Overall, I rate these file folders as 5-Star. The actual folders are very solid, cosmetically appealing yet neutral, and well-worth the price. Despite the tabs and labels being of substandard quality, they're easy to insert into the folders and remain in place.",26,14.187801

It is lightweight enough that I can easily lift it onto the bus and it doesn't take up a lot of room in the aisle. It is very well made and well designed. It holds two shopping bags that are slightly smaller than a standard paper grocery bag (I got reusable plastic ones at the local drugstore with their logo on them, and they fit perfectly). Quite frankly if it held any more, it would be too heavy for me to haul. It fits underneath the grocery store's shopping cart, on that shelf below.

I did discover that once it is loaded, you can't steer it if you try to push it in front of you; you have to pull it behind you. After almost a mile my arm and shoulder got quite tired, but I am an elderly lady and a normal person wouldn't have a bit of a problem. This is the perfect size for someone short. A tall person might find the handle too low. (You can buy stroller extender handles online.) I found the wheels to be quite adequate on pavement and brick sidewalks. At home, I was able to pull it up the stairs despite it being a bit heavy; the wheels worked well.

They were out of the red color when I ordered it, so I got neon green ... the color is growing on me and I am quite sure that everyone sees me when I am crossing the street, and I will not get run over!

All in all, I can't recommend this enough. I am thrilled with it and it fits my needs exactly. My next excursion with it will be to and from Walmart on the bus. Because it is not too big, I know that if I limit my shopping to items that will fit in it, I will be able to lift it.

If you want to know the winner just jump down to the conclusion, if you want to see the staplers in action check out the video.

Recently I wanted to replace my aging Arrow T25 Cable/Wire stapler which lead me to research, test and tryout several cable wiring staple guns which lead to some surprising results.

I tested out five staple guns, two from Arrow, one from DeWalt, one from Stanley and one from a company I never heard of called SureBonder.

Arrow T25:
The Arrow T25 Stapler has been around for more than a decade and is the defunct, industry standard for stapling Wire and Cable. The T25 Staple Gun is a dedicated Crown Staple Gun and only shoot round, crown staples. I don't have anything bad to say about the Arrow T25 Staple gun, it does a good job although it does jam occasionally. The Staple Gun itself is all metal and well build. I've dropped it from my ladder several times and it's withstood all kinds of use and abuse and still works well after a decade. The Arrow T25 is the most expensive staple gun for wiring I tested.

DeWalt DWHTTR410 Multi-Tacker:
I love DeWalt tools however I have mixed feelings for this staple gun. The DeWalt 4-in-1 Multi-Tacker is well built and feels great to use however the drive force is too strong and leave wires kinked, crimped and sometimes damaged due to excess staple pressure. I like the feel of the DeWalt staple gun in my hand and it works great for straight staples however due to the cable//wire damage I cannot recommend it for stapling wires. DeWalt recently reduced the price of this staple gun.

SureBonder 5645 2-in-1 Heavy Duty Cable/Staple Gun:
I never heard of Surebonder and when I looked online for reviews on the 5645 Staple Gun, I could only find one which made me very apprehensive about ordering it. the Surebonder 2-in-1 Staple guns is the lowest priced staple gun I purchased and frankly based on the lack of reviews and unknown name I didn't have high expectations for this product .... boy was I surprised.

The SureBonder 5645 is made of all metal except for the handle which like the DeWalt is plastic/rubber and metal reinforced. The staple gun is bottom loading and during my test and subsequent use works great and so far hasn't jammed once. As the name says the Surebonder 2-in-1 shoots both straight and curved (Crown) staples. I was mainly interested in a crown stapler for wiring. The Surebonder had the deepest wiring guide and I felt confident using it that I wouldn't miss fire a staple into the wire. The Hi-Lo drive force adjustment was easy to switch and the change in drive pressure was noticeable. The stapler handle was easy and comfortable to hold and it took moderate grip strength to trigger/fire a staple. I was impressed by the performance of the Surebonder 5645 and out of all the five staple guns the Surebonder became my favorite for stapling wire and cable.

Staples Guns Not Shown in the Video:

Stanley CT10X Heavy Duty Staple Gun/Cable Tacker:
The Stanley CT10X Staple Gun is not included in this video however I did test it out at a local hardware store and found the performance similar to the DeWalt 4-in-1 Multi Tacker. Even at the lowest power setting the Stanley Stapler kinked and crimped at wire at the staple location and even penetrated through the outside jacket and on some of the wires bent them significantly and in a couple cases even penetrated through the PVC coating on the wire. I found the Hi-Lo adjustment lever on the Stanley CT10X the hardest to adjust and I found negligible difference between the Hi and Lo settings. The Stanley CT10X shoots both straight and curved staples. The Stanley CT10X Staple Gun works well for shooting straight staples but should be avoided if you plan to use it with crown staples to staple down wires. Even at the lowest setting the staple drive force is too strong and may cause damage to your wires.

Arrow 2025 Dual Purpose Staple Tacker:
The Arrow 2025 is a horrible staple gun and the most uncomfortable to use out of all the Staple Guns Tested. While the Arrow 2025 Staple gun is supposed to shoot straight and round staples it doesn't do either well and often jams. I strongly recommend you avoid this staple gun.

CONCLUSION:
Winner for Stapling Wires:
SureBonder 5645, 2-in-1 Heavy Duty Cable/Staple Gun.

The SureBonder 5645 was the lowest priced staple gun in my tests and surprisingly the best performer. The SureBonder 2-in-1 Staple Gun shoots both straight and round (crown) staples and does an excellent job at both and does not damage the 22AWG/4 conductor wire we used during our test. In addition the High/Low drive force adjustment lever was easy to switch and there was a noticeable change in drive force. The SureBonder staple gun itself is well built and made of mostly metal parts. The handle is fairly easy to press, requiring moderate grip strength and the wire guide is the deepest making it easy to set the staple gun against the wire .

The next best Staple Gun for wiring is the Arrow T25 Staple Gun. The Arrow T25 has been around for years and is a proven performer although in recent years many users have complained about the staple gun jamming and wearing out prematurely. Overall the Arrow T25 does a good job at stapling down wires however it does take the most grip strength to fire the staple gun and is the most expensive (Twice the cost of the SureBonder 2-in1).

The Dewalt 4-in-1 Multi-Tacker looks great and feels good to hold in your hand however I do not recommend it for stapling any type of wire. The drive force of this staple gun kinks and crimps wires and can lead to damage or degradation of your wire. The DeWalt 4-in-1 Staple gun is fine for shooting straight staples, just not crown staples.

Others to Avoid: I do not recommend the Stanley CT10X staples it has similar results to the Dewalt and may damage the cable or wire you are stapling. Likewise I would avoid the Arrow 2025 Dual Purpose Stapler, it's doesn't do a good job at anything and often jams.

Overall the answering machine is working fine, but it has two annoying behaviors.

We have more than one phone in the house.  When a call is answered on another phone the answering machine shows these calls as ""missed calls"".  The second annoyance that it seems not be able to handle day light savings time. Even when I correct the time manually it resets itself to the wrong time.  So for half of the year the phone calls are shown as 1 hour off.  I read the manual trying to find how to change this and could not find it.  If someone who is reading this review knows how make it responsive to Day Light Savings time I would really appreciate a tip on how to do it.

On the positive side, the display is large and clear.  The screen has a back light (note that the dial buttons do not have back light). The back light is turned on when a phone call is coming in or when you press any button. The voice that comes in on the phone is loud and sounds good. This is also true when you use the speaker phone.  I am told that I sound crisp and clear even when I am using the speaker phone.  When there is a message waiting there is a button that blinks to indicate a waiting message. The manual states that you can also configure a beep to indicate a waiting message, but we do not use this option.  The answering machine is easy to turn on and off (a button that glows when answering machine is turned on).  I have caller id, so when a new phone call comes in I can see the phone number and name displayed on the screen (it is not announced by voice, just displayed).

I am using this phone as a wall phone. I like how the attachment bracket is designed - it is easy to hang and the phone is lifted a little away from the wall.  The handset has a special catch to make it work well as a wall phone.

The messages and greeting announcements are digitally recorded in the internal media.  Recording my own greeting was easy.

This phone comes with AC adapter but it is actually possible to make calls during power failure. The power comes from the phone line itself, so it is limited to making and receiving calls. Other functionality is not available unless you have power.  After the power outage I have to reset time, but my pre-programmed quick dial numbers are NOT lost.

Other than the two negatives I mentioned at the start of the review the phone has many good features that I like.

I thought it a grand idea as presently I just threw everything in a folder, and not even in date order so it was a mess to go thru when I needed something.

3039,"'Old Reliable' -- aka my Samsung ML 1210 -- was wheezing more than a climber at the top of Everest. My Panasonic fax was as feisty as ever, grabbing 4 pages at a time while sending/receiving faxes Jackson Pollack-style. It was time for an upgrade. Wow; what a step up.

Of all the companies to offer 'true' OS X, Mac-compatibility, surprising to see it from a traditionally fax machine/label maker one. Brother's MFC 7820N software functionality is flawless for my wife and I's iBook's, running 10.3 and 10.4, respectively. True 'touch controls' power this unit, the Control Center software allows seamless and intelligent faxing, copying and scanning to customizable folders, email locations, etc. I did a double-take when spotting PC Fax capability LIMITED TO MAC's(!). Control Center is so Mac-friendly, it even comes with software for folks running OS 9.

Moreover, setting up this unit to print wirelessly from a network was a snap. It quickly linked up with my Belkin Wireless Access Point, finally allowing affordable printing AND faxing (from local files) without being tethered to a desk. The Remote Setup function is likewise very clean; a nice break from endless scrolling across the sharp LCD. I still, however, face the occasional (once every month, on average) software glitch in print jobs not communicating wirelessly with the printer. Turning the system off/on again solves the problem pronto.

Hardware-wise, the MFC 7820N is standard quality for multifunction units...hardened plastic with decent give...although with a much smaller footprint than competitors (including several from Brother). To put size into perspective, the MFC 7820N is approximately 1/3rd wider than standalone, monochrome laser printers, same height. Dig the large slide out paper try + print output at the center of the unit. No paper mess spewing from this one. Related, the paper feed (at early review) is outstanding. Take that, Panasonic fax.

Cost-wise, the MFC 7820N is a steal, a couple hundred bucks less than similarly featured units. Toner can be had at 1/2 the price of most conventional laser units -- $40 or lower.

Nearly 8 months in, I am left wondering why I stomached the high pitched squeal of my ML 1210 for this long. This Mac user finds the MFC 7820N a winner.",30,14.616211

I have the Iris scrapbook cart and that is a well designed item. This is not. It's flimsy. The fact that the drawers are not flat is a problem for many items. They are a tad too shallow for a good many things that I was hoping to use this for (bottles of ink). If the drawers were the depth of the edges, the bottles would have fit, so it's quite frustrating.

Additionally, the drawers don't come out far enough and they fall open easily. The whole thing teeters. Why did I keep mine? Probably because it matches my others Iris cart and I was too lazy to send it back. I am not happy with the purchase but I bought an open box and paid less. But frankly, I wouldn't recommend this cart to anyone. Look elsewhere, or, if you want a cart for 12""x 12 paper and don't mind pulling out the entire closed drawer to access them, get the Iris scrapbooking cart.

3044,"Update: After abut more abuse given by students I'm down grading my rating from 5 to 4 stars. I have had to use packing tape on many of the drama. Still got the money, I recommend these along with a decent roll of packing tape. It's still cheaper than buying from Really Good Stuff.  The ones if have been using all year for my books are holding up fine.

I bought these to use as reading bags for my kindergarten students. They keep their reading group books in them. Most of them have held up fine. I did have one that the snap broke off, but that one belongs to a student I would describe as a tornado, if you get my drift. The students seem to handle the snap without problems. I like that they are color coded because my reading groups color coded. Since the student groupings are fluid I passed out their colors randomly, but I keep my plans for that day in envelopes that are color coded so I can easily grab that group's reading lesson.

The plastic used for the envelope is comparable to the envelopes you can buy from Really Good Stuff and is a fraction of the price. My son's class has those envelopes and his is holding up similarly to my students'. I do recommend some clear packing tape because a few will separate at the seams if the students are rough with them.

Overall I am happy with this purchase and will buy them again.",7,8.776999
3045,"When I was growing up in the 1980's, my family owned a TI-99/4A computer, which was one of the first home computers.  Using this keyboard with my calculator reminded me of that.  We had a word processor.  Just like the one that goes with this keyboard, there was no text formatting, no mouse, no graphics, and only very basic cutting and pasting functions.  Nevertheless, I like this keyboard.
I got it as part of a grant.  I really didn't want the keyboards at all, but they were part of the grant.  As part of my grant, I needed to find a use for them in my classroom.  So far I have used them for taking lab notes and for writing lab reports.
This has been wonderful.  Students have easy access to data, can easily share lab notes, and can even take notes in class.  I'm a science teacher, so naturally I enjoy this equipment.  However, now the English teacher is interested in borrowing it.  She likes the idea of the students typing essays in class (instead of hand writing them).  It's almost like giving each student a lap top computer, but without the distractions or the hefty price tag.
I strongly recommend this tool!
So, why 4 stars and not 5?  I've watched classrooms full of kids use the keyboard and I have used my own.  I have noticed that the keyboard and cradle have very flimsy stands.  They can break off even when a student is being careful.
In addition, there is too much cable.  I like the way the cable is stored inside the cradle, but I do not like all the excess that can't be stored in it.  These two feet of cable are hard to store (a consideration if it travels in a backpack).
Finally, I wish the keyboard came with a cover like the calculator does.  I take mine at home at night to write up papers for my students (no, I don't own a computer).  I don't like all the buttons out in the open to collect dirt and filth and to be held down by my books.
Other than these quibbles, I am very happy!",23,11.527488
3046,"Copic Markers are the best alcohol markers you can buy. They are a little heavy on the price tag, but once you purchase the actual color marker, you never have to throw it away. (At least for a very long time anyway), you buy refills for these, which is a little less than the marker itself but it refills the marker several times.( you can also replace the ends of them if you need to). With these you can blend like no other makers. And what I really love about them, is that you can color over your image as much as you need to, and no matter how much ink you put down, you don't have to worry about your paper rolling up or taring. That in my opinion, is worth it, because every other marker I have ever had, after I put so much ink on my paper it would start tearing. Feel free to color away with this as much as youd like, and you don't have to worry about that. I would recommend getting some good paper.

3055,"This paper cutter has no finger guard on the pressure (paper holder) bar.  It is very easy to cut your finger because the pressure guard is also loose and comes off, paper slips, uneven cuts.  I also think it is not really strong enough to cut a folded card (two layers of card stock at once), so the card slips and the cut is wrong.  I have used guillotine cutters for years and never once have I had a problem with cutting my fingers.  I am a very productive crafter so I use the cutters almost every day.  I have a large tonic guillotine and a full size office guillotine.  I wanted a smaller one for my desktop, thinking it would be handier.  In that respect it is.

The cells offer a practical storage solution for bras, socks, and panties. They fit nicely in my closet shelving and also work well for transporting washed delicates from the laundry room. Another benefit is that they help me sort out and locate socks quicker... So much better than piling them in a drawer!

Out of the three, I find the 24-cell box to be the most useful. It fits a pair of socks nicely and can even accommodate 2 pairs of smaller ankle socks. The medium-sized (6-cell) box, intended for bras, is too small for mine. I still manage to stuff 6 of my Victoria Secret bras in there, but it's a tight fit. It works better for smaller bras... A's and B's, but if you need them for C's or larger, don't plan on this being your ""ultimate solution"" to bra storage.

Appearance wise: The lattice print is subtle and cute. I also like the grey color. The fabric is flimsy, and I certainly would NOT call this a high-quality product.

Perspective: I would not be embarrassed to have these out on a shelf in my walk-in closet during an Open-House. (Other than not wanting strangers to see my delicates, LOL.)  Plus, considering how they only cost me around $6, complaining about the quality is not justified. (Let's be realistic... Really, what can you expect for that price?)

It took a bit of effort to find out what was violated and they claimed excessive use.  There is no support number; you have to get support online only with live chat or from their knowledge base.  There is a billing questions number and you can call that.  That's the only way to get a live person, but they only want you to call it for billing questions.

The problem is you have no idea what constitutes excessive use or when you might be exceeding their limits.  The terms of service says if your usage exceeds 20 times more than the average customer or more than 50 calls a day you have violated the terms.  The 50 calls is easy to quantify, but what about the 20 times more than the average?  The terms also say it is not limited to just this criteria, so you have no clue what other criteria they might use to decide that you have had excessive use.  There is no way to know what that is.  Instead of just suspending your service for a while, they cut you off permanently with no recourse.  You lose any remaining time you may have paid for.

I've been using some high quality 24 lb Xerox copy paper from Costco, also very smooth.  The difference between these two papers is very clear.  The colors with the Hammermill paper are more vivid, and the bleed through is much less.  I'm going to enjoy using this paper a lot, and am going to try it with watercolor pencils too.  What I was surprised about was where it actually shipped from:  Sam's Club!  So I checked Costco, and discovered it is sold there, including shipping, for under $10.",2,8.627659
3071,"The Writeyboard Neon Low Odor Premium Wet Erase Markers arrived quickly, were well packaged and undamaged.

Maybe it is the teacher in me but I get so excited about school supplies.  So now that Im working from my home office with the new school year fast approaching, I am so excited about these new markers for my whiteboard as the planning phase begins this week.  When I initially saw the Writeyboard markers summary, I felt myself checking the boxes mentally:
- Neon (that sounds fun)
- Low-Odor (no headaches from that normally horrible dry eraser marker smell)
- Eco-friendly (care for the environment and others)
- 8 pack (choicesI love choices)
-  Wet erase.(what??? Ive been using dry eraser markers???)
Hence, something new and different to start the school year; let the creativity and organization flow.  Ive got to have them.  As I read further, they are liquid chalk so I just had to try them out.  According to the web description, you can use them on clear, black or white dry erase surfaces.

After using these for the purpose I originally planned, I looked at other suggested uses and that is when my creativity started to flow:  Glass, metal, chalkboards, whiteboard, paint glazed ceramics, plastic, or any other non-porous surface!

Ill update my review if I find anything wrong but for now this gets solid 5 stars from me! Im glad I was offered the opportunity to purchase this at a reduced rate to review.

So far seems like heavy weight solid constuction, all the adjustments work fine....plus you can raise and lower the armrests to various heights with a little locking switch!
The chair reclines completely flat......why I would want to do that I don't know, but it does it.

The only bad thing i can say is I don't care for the lumbar pillow, but its easily removable in 5 seconds....but I hate ALL lumbar suppoprts, they hurt my back, so thats just a ME thing. Maybe if my back gives out I'll like the feature.

Now I wish I had stuck with the plain black ones from arc.  Even with the smaller sized arc disks and a book pretty much full the pages opened easily.  With these I am constantly tugging at the pages to get them to turn cleanly.  A big disappointment with a higher cost. Again maybe the arc holes are a differ size or shape compaired to the levenger ones so in an original levenger book they might be great but with my system not so good.,2,5.6068063
3075,"I didn't wanna do it. . . I mean, seriously, who pays $24 for 12 pencils? That's two bucks a pencil. You can buy perfectly adequate pencils for $2 for a box of 12. These are TWELVE TIMES more expensive.

I've always had a thing for writing implements, and am very picky about my pencils (don't get me started on the awful office pencils. I buy my own out of pocket). My perfect pencil would be one that held a point without breaking, dark lead, comfortable to hold, an eraser that lasted through most of the pencil, smooth writing.  I was happy with my Dixon Ticonderoga Tri-Writes for years. They weren't perfect, but they were. . . adequate.

Then I saw a review for the Palomino Blackwings, and bought them on impulse, not really believing the reviews, thinking I'd debunk them. Even when I hit ""Purchase"", I couldn't quite believe I'd bought them.

So who pays $24 for 12 pencils? Me, that's who. I'm addicted. The writing is so smooth and easy. The lead is dark, easily readable and doesn't smudge--very important for crosswords!. The lead is probably softer than what you're used to (I think it's #1 vs. the standard #2), but I wound up liking that once I got used to it.

The point doesn't break easily--you really don't need as much pressure with this. It lives up to its slogan. And since they don't break as often as my old pencils, they last longer, so you get some good value for your money that way.

The eraser--the eraser alone is worth the premium. It's extendable so it'll last as long as the pencil. It's  rectangular, so you can easily erase fine points or wide swaths--you can even fidget with it like a clicky pen.

I honestly didn't think this pencil was all that great until I tried to go back to my Tri-Writes when I couldn't find the Palomino. It was like going from a Porsche to a Pinto. I stopped what I was working on to search for my Palominos.

My one minor quibble is, although it says it's made of incense cedar, I don't notice any aroma (I love the smell of a freshly-sharpened pencil). Given what a joy they are to use, though, I'll just sniff a cedar block instead.",196,9.814394

I returned it as I regarded it as obsolete equipment with issues at that point. The seller would not give me a full refund as he claimed he had costs to cover with the transaction, despite Amazon's A-Z guarantee. Palm also stated a lot of these units being sold as ""new"" are truly ""reconditioned"". I wish it had worked with Windows 7 and MS Outlook 2010 - 32 bit - but it did not.

The Soft Gloss produces a great print when used with the proper printer settings setting and I have never had one complaint, actually people more often compliment the prints and they show well when professionally framed.

3089,"When I buy a laser printer I have two criteria that must be met: it must be postscript compatible for printing graphic design proofs and it must have fairly accurate color.

This printer has done a fair job of both. It is postscript compatible but the accurate color is a little lacking. I've found that color proofs are a little dark and slightly heavy in magenta and cyan.

I've owned HP color laser jets in the past and I like that there is no drum roller, only cartridges to replace. This can save $200 in replacement part costs. I like that you can replace one color at a time and I find that I don't have to do it too often. The cartridges are way overpriced but I think that is common with any printer these days.

I have no trouble printing on a variety of papers. I never use the card readers in the front but it is convenient to have them.
I have hooked the printer up to a network with no trouble.

It does not take too long to print but is fairly loud. It is also loud when it cycles on its own.

It does have a power save mode that it goes into automatically.

I really wish I had a second drawer to keep preprinted paper (invoices or letterhead). I have not found that the front paper feeder is easy to use so I always use the pull out drawer.

Then the printhead needed to be replaced - according to the diagnostics.  OK, it happens.  So I bought a new one. Even though I've only had it for less than a year and the printer is not *heavily* used by any stretch of the imagination.

And now, every few days, the printer sits in ""maintenance mode...."" and I have to pull the plug to recover.

from en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moleskine

""History

Notebooks with features similar to the present Moleskine notebooks were a popular standard in 19th and 20th century Europe, handmade by small French bookbinders who supplied the stationery shops of Paris. As documented by many art collections and museums, in the late 19th to early 20th centuries, these nameless notebooks became a prominent creative tool for avant-garde artists who enjoyed drawing and writing outdoors; putting down impressions on paper; painting from life in the streets and cafs; and capturing extemporary scenes, ideas, and emotions. Among artists who used similar black notebooks were Oscar Wilde, Vincent van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, Ernest Hemingway and Henri Matisse.
The present Moleskine notebook is specifically fashioned after Bruce Chatwin's descriptions of the notebooks he used in his travels. The name itself, ""Moleskine"", is a nickname that Chatwin uses in one of his most celebrated writings, The Songlines (1986). In this book, Chatwin tells the story of his original supplier of notebooks, a Paris stationer who in 1986 informed him that the last notebook manufacturer, a small family-run firm in Tours, had discontinued production that year, after the death of the owner. ""Le vrai Moleskine n'est plus"" (""The real Moleskine is no more"") are the words Chatwin puts in the mouth of the owner of the stationery shop in Rue de l'Ancienne Comdie.[2]
In 1997 a small company based in Milan named Modo & Modo SpA decided to bring this notebook back to life, establishing the Moleskine trademark and starting production of Moleskine notebooks with 5000 pieces. In 1999, Modo & Modo SpA started distributing outside Italy, in the US and Europe. In 2004, Moleskine notebooks arrived in Japan, and from there Moleskine started distribution to the rest of Asia. Perhaps due to their link to the literary and cultural heritage of the Moleskine notebooks, bookshop retailers and design stores everywhere are the main channels for the notebook.
In 2006, according to an article in The Daily Telegraph, the company's small staff was unable to keep up with demand.[3] In August 2006, the French investment fund Socit Gnrale Capital purchased Modo & Modo SpA, and started investing in its expansion. The company name changed into ""Moleskine Srl"". According to an article in the German magazine Brand Eins, in 2008 Moleskine notebooks were distributed in 53 countries, through 14,000 stores, 65% of which are bookshops.[4]
In 2011, Moleskine production extended to new categories with the new Writing, Travelling and Reading Collections, launched at the Milan Design Week 2011.[5] Most of the objects in these new collections are designed by Italian industrial designer Giulio Iacchetti. They include bags, computer cases, reading glasses, pens and pencils, booklights, and reading stands.""",5,14.5487585
3097,"My Kaweco AL Sport fine nib is a great little pen, writes well and is an amazing bargain.  I was disappointed with this converter as it does not hold a lot of ink and is much more awkward to use than a piston type converter. It has a cheap feel to it. Given that I use this pen as an ""every day carry"" and do not really need to have  fine ink in it I think that cartridges will probably make more sense for me. This converter might also make sense if you only use the pen for signatures and brief notes and do not use a lot of ink. I get the feeling that Kaweco saw that there was big pent up demand for a converter for the Sport model so they gave us this. Too bad because the pen is beautifully designed and writes really well, and it would have been nice to have a converter of matching quality. I suppose that given the pen's size this was the only design that would work.",11,4.896733
3098,"I want to explain first why I got this so you know how it worked for us.  My son has ADHD and once he got into middle school, he has struggled with being organized, focused and remembering at the end of the day what he needs to bring home.  We have tried using a calendar, etc... and he still at the end of the day struggles.  So I had this idea and thought if I could find a magnetic post it note holder that it would help.

So, this post it note holder holds 3 x 3 pop up notes.  That's important to know because unless they are the pop up notes they will not work.  This holder has a magnet on the back to attach to the fridge, file cabinet, locker, etc...  The magnet really stays attached well.  It is a long magnet on the back.  My son did take the magnet off when we first got it (he messed with it until it came off). If it comes off, just glue it back on and it's fine.  There is a pen holder which makes it really convenient so that you don't have to go looking for a pen.  If you use, the pop up post its, the notes just come right out.

So back to my son....What I have done is on each post it note, I have written - Science, English, Math, Civics on each post it note and he has the dispenser in his locker at school.  At the end of the day, he pulls off the top post it and goes through each class and checks off that he has his work.  This really seems to help him focus at the end of the day.

I like to use it for different things at different times, so I use the top page of my papers to write in what each tab is supposed to be and change that piece of paper as I use it in different ways.

While society is becoming more and more paperless, I've still found this a handy tool.  Sometimes I use it to sort mail when I get behind, sometimes in the car for big errand/shopping weeks to sort different sorts of papers/receipts for the car (coupons, receipts for returns, receipts to process at home from bank, credit cards, etc.,).

There are also many different ringtones to choose from that can be applied just like the color-coded bars.

This is definitely a good phone, and a good value for the money. Panasonic builds reliable products (I have a 25 year old Panasonic VCR that still works!) so I'd imagine this one will last me for a good while.",14,9.823937

However, as time went on these two things happened:  1) These ink cartridges emptied much more quickly than the canon ink cartridges  2) Even worse, as I replaced more and more of them, the printer started not working.  I would get lines and whole pages with only smatterings of words.  I replaced all the Jarbo ink cartridges with Canon cartridges, and the printer printed fine.

After trying Worldwide Toner (jammed), JCB Park (ghosting), V4INK (worse ghosting), I finally came back to INK4WORK which I have used successfully in the past and this cartridge doesn't have any of the problems I encountered so far.  On the downside, it's lighter at 476g than many of the other cartridges I tried which were around 500g, but as long as it works I'm happy to sacrifice page count.  I also noticed that unlike other brands, these ones are actually barcoded and marked with some kind of sticker that probably identifies who refurbished or produced it, and I think that may contribute to them working better.

3120,"The Scotch ""Magic Tape Donut Dispenser"" is a very clever dispenser that is perfect for carrying in a pocket, backpack, or purse since the tape is completely protected when not in use. Here are my observations:

Pros:
+ Good Tape; I like Scotch tape since it is matte finish and generally out performs cheaper brands
+ Donut Dispenser; protects tape and is easy to use

Cons:
- A Little Pricy

Hints:
* Place sticky side of tape facing the white cutter piece
* Push tape gently inward when closing white cutter piece

This is a handy little dispenser that works very well and allows for easy transporting of tape!

Highly Recommended!

3122,"I love this thing, but there are a couple of quirks I should note.  I like it enough to ignore them, but it might be a deal breaker for others.

1. It's rather large, I think.  It's not comfy to hold in one hand as I did with my previous label maker.
2. The buttons need a bit of heavy handedness.  You have to give them a good solid press, or it'll easily skip.
3. The cut button is needlessly huge.

The listing has a good pic of the front, but I've made a couple of pix of the back of it.

In one pic you can see the view window for the label cartridge.  Very handy, that, plus it's indented enough that it's what I use to brace a finger to allow me to hold it with 1 hand.  It works for either hand, despite the honkin big cut button.  You can also see where it's molded into the case the size of the label spools needed, which I appreciate VERY much.  And that useful little 'quick tips' bit was all I needed to get me started.

Other pic you can see all the innards.  This is part of what allows me to overlook its overall large size - plenty of room to get hold of the cartridge and/or batteries.  Having had a much smaller one, I well remember struggling to change the cartridge.

You'll need to fiddle around with buttons to find the various special effects menus and how they work, but it really does have what I consider to be some serious extras there.  Frames, fonts, sizes, multiple lines, etc.  Extremely useful.

They have plenty of different label types, like iron-ons, etc.  Lots of different colors.  And of course, as others have noted, this one wastes a lot less tape on beginning and end blank space.

I have been refilling, as well as using remanufactured ink cartridges for several years. They are what they are, and sometimes they don't work, or leak, or any number of other user issues. Some new ink cartridges are no better and cost a lot more. There are tricks to getting an unwilling ink cartridge to print, but it's a pain and doesn't always work.

I bought this brand for price, free shipping and because I couldn't refill my HP 15 anymore. They do wear out, and my last unused cartridge was dead out of the box. Appears to have been out of date, they do have a limited shelf life. Since Walmart doesn't sell that brand anymore, I couldn't return it.

Out of the box today, the first cartridge worked perfectly. If two or more out of the four work, I'm good at this price. The pricing for this brand makes refilling a no go.

I would also add that these cartridges are properly packaged, print head taped, plastic cap and sealed in a bag.

I read one review complaining about rattling inside the ink cartridge. Cartridges like the HP 15 have a bladder that holds the ink, not sponges, and the fill hole is plugged with a 5/32 ball bearing that is then covered with a stick on seal. The ball bearings are pushed into the bladder, refill several times and you get shake, rattle and roll, no extra charge.

The only thing missing, is a way to recycle these cartridges back to the manufacture. Walmart use to have plastic, prepaid mailing bags to recycle used ink cartridges. Not so these days.",10,8.030701

3141,"Best pocket-sized notepad I've ever seen. I have two and I gave two to a lady friend of mine. (This is one of the two I gave her.) Both of us are photographers and we each need a small notepad to record IDs.
These notepads come in two versions, apparently, which isn't all that clear in descriptions. I bought two of each:
1) The Signature Flip Notes feature a cover that can be folded all the way behind the notepad, which makes it fit one's hand very well while taking notes while standing. A small magnet holds the cover closed. The pen does not have to be removed to open the note pad. My brown faux leather one measures 2-7/8x4-3/8x3/8.
2) The Metal Flip Notes are, indeed, made of metal. The cover doesn't fold past 180 degrees, so it's best used while flat on a surface. The pen is held by both front and back; or, put another way, the inserted pen holds the front and back closed. You have to remove the pen at least half-way up to open it. My metal one measures 2-7/8x4-3/8x1/4 (slightly thinner than the Signature).
Both versions use the same kind of pen and same kind of paper pads. You can write on a note and immediately tear it out if you want to give it to someone else.
Both versions are truly pocket-sized, which is exactly what we were looking for. For me, to go in a shirt pocket. My lady friend carries a very small pocketbook, and she finds it fits perfectly.

There are many mixed reviews about all of these x-brace type banner stands, and frankly none of them are top-quality-i-can-use-these-forever type products. So I went out, bought 5 different ones and tested them all in a real convention.

Tektrum got it right in several areas that makes this the best X brace stand for this price range. The central hub is strong, well made with low tolerances so that the poles fit snug. And it comes with a zipper pouch (like most others) to keep it clean.

Here are a few things that make the Tektrum stand out. There is additional bracing at the bottom poles to help provide stability and support to the stand and banner. The hooks at the bottom poles are adjustable to give greater flexibility and range of sized banners you can use. There are two extension poles that can be used for maximizing the size banner used. Lastly, instead of hooks on the top of the poles, they opt'ed to use a metal threaded rod and cap nut. The cap nut actually is just sized right to fit in normal sized grommets for this sized banner, but also can be unscrewed to accommodate smaller grommets if needed.

After testing 5 different stands, I found this to be the best and ended up buying 10 of them. They set up just as fast as the others, and adjusting just took at philips screw driver.

Its still dark, but its beautiful. This was on high quality journal paper of course, I can't attest to what it looks like on notebook paper after a week.

It was too small, cramped, and the desiqn of the lid made it impossible to see the cards in the back. On an impulse buy I grabbed this one. I love it! Its roomy, the cards(4x6) are large enough for ALL the info and since the lid opens like a normal lid would, I can easily flip to even the recipes in the back! I had to change some of the tab labels to suit my preferences but who cares. And although I've always stored my recipe box in the cupboard- after I received this one and saw how pretty it was, I felt compelled to find a place for it right out on the counter. It has a slight gloss to it so you can wipe messes off but I assume it will stain or get water damage fairly easily if you're not careful.

It can also be chemically erased/eradicated by sulfate-sulfite eradicators like the Pelikan Super Pirat, which is convenient for students.

3171,"I am terrible about answering my cell phone when I'm at home. It's always someplace else, either in my purse, out in my car, the other room, on silent, or charging. I love this Motorola bluetooth set-up because it simplifies my life! Now, when I am home and my cell phone rings, even if it's on silent - which it is a majority of the time, this phone rings to alert me (in a different ring tone, so you know what line is ringing). I can pick it up on any of the three handsets or my cell phone. Same with my husbands cell phone. I have bluetooth in my car and love it, now it has transitioned into my house seamlessly and works fabulously.

My cell phone can be in the car, dying (of course you'll have to charge it or your call will hang up when your phone dies) or charging, but it doesn't matter because with three handsets, one is always charged (I'm bad at that too - of course). It also rings when some one calls the land line, as a traditional phone.

The answering machine is great - I can't hear the messages. I HATE when someone calls and the answering machine picks up and it plays their message super loud - especially when we have company. This phone is super easy, you can access and listen the voice-mail from any handset.

The handsets are small and light weight, but do not feel cheap. The display is large and easy to read. I had to read the directions to set up the bluetooth, but if you've set it up in your car, I would say this is easier.

So for medium-security items (you're not going to have your identity stolen from a prescription bottle), this is ok.

3177,"QUICK SUMMARY:  No more ink cartridges!  And a printer that always stays online!  Hallelejah!

BACKGROUND:  I've used many makes and models of ink jet printers over many years.  The latest was an Epson, before that, HP and Canon.  In all, they were all disappointing for two reasons.  One, the just didn't last very long before they stopped printing correctly -- the ink jet printer head would gum up and couldn't be cleaned using the expensive-to-use ""clean printhead"" option; two, the cost of ink jet cartridges was just crazy -- so, so expensive.

Our last Epson frustrated us with automatic software downloads onto our computers, popping up all the time saying the printer was out of ink, and going offline constantly.  That was the straw that broke the camel's back.

I researched Amazon extensively and selected this Brother replacement laser all-in-one.  What a blessing it has become!  After using it for several months, it finally just now ran out of the laser toner, which was just a sample cartridge.  I've installed the high capacity toner cartridge and I think that'll be it for the rest of this year!

The Brother was *immediately* recognized by Windows 10 -- I didn't even have to search for a new printer, it was already there, waiting for me to select it.  And now that it's my default, it's always ready, everytime.

The black-and-white print is perfect, what you'd expect from a laser printer.

No, I don't have color prints anymore, but there's an Office Depot a mile away if I really need a color print-out.

I'm done with ink jet printers and the high cost of inkjet replacement cartridges.

Thank you, Brother, and thank you, Amazon customers, for up-voting this make and model!  You were right!!!",4,11.622115

When the tip is retracted, you can hear the spring the moving around. It's not an awful sound but it was noticeable to me. Also, after a few weeks, the ink started to skip. I called Cross and they were very nice. They are sending me a new refill for free and asked that I send them the defective one so they can test it.

I now know what I don't know, I know that Brother has minimal experience with this unit in a Windows 7 environment, and that my expectations for this MFC are considerably lower than when I purchased it a week ago. Shame on them for loosing this contraption on the market without having tested it more thoroughly!

Networking this printer can be described in a single word: NIGHTMARE. Nothing I've tried works, including the in-depth fixes on the customer support site.  If you run a small business and think you'll be able to wirelessly network multiple computers to this printer, lots of luck. Really. There are more exceptions than rules when it comes to setting things up using the Brother guide book supplied (minimal instructions at best). And if you're not a computer professional, you're just taking your chances.

In all fairness, my experience might have been better had I used a wired network, but I paid more $$$ for this wireless function, which I've been entirely unable to access/utilize.

Other than that, the laser print quality is great, it prints quickly, no jams, etc.  All the things you'd expect in a 4-in-1 printer. Just don't think you'll be doing it wirelessly (if at all!), without your share of headaches. I wish I had saved my money and simply purchased a laser 4:1 that did not have wireless, or a brand with more wireless compatibility and many fewer connectivity and software issues. Of course, how would I have known which brand(s) those were? I wouldn't have; but now you can at least know the Brother MFC-7840W isn't among them.",10,7.494531

This printer worked great for the few months that it stayed connected to my network. One day a few months ago it simply failed to connect, and a new computer and network later I STILL can't get it to print. It's ridiculous that something as simple as connecting to a wireless network would make an otherwise good product no more useful that a paper weight.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I Love this printer, but it looses a star for the difficult setup. I am a fairly tech savvy individual and it still took me 2 hours to set this up with reading through the reviews. The quick setup instructions are essentially useless. A couple of tips before I comment on the actual printer. Taking the previous reviewer's advice you will definitely have to upgrade the firmware on this. You must first set up the printer with the manual wireless setup. After that you will be able to print wirelessly. If you then want to do the wireless direct to print from your phone you must then upgrade the firmware, THEN go back to the first set up disk and do a direct wireless setup. Having to basically set up the printer TWICE is where I got stuck in the process. From then on, it works flawlessly.

The printer itself is great! I got it at a steal from a big box store, which made it even more worthwhile. It is compact, and the design allows me to store it under my (elevated) bed rather than use precious surface space in my small apt. The auto duplexing is a dream and the print quality is spectacular. I have printed images on the brother laser printer and this and this definitely wins. Even fine graphics (pwpt notes slides) print with clarity. I have also been able to print from my phone with ease, however, I have a Samsung phone so I can't speak to the compatibility of other systems.

Another point, which was something that I ran into when doing my research on different models was what exactly is the difference between the
SL-M2830DW  and the SL-M2835DW models. The only difference between the two is this model (2830) combines the drum and toner) the 2835 has a 2 piece unit (toner and imaging unit) which is supposed to reduce the cost per page. However, the toner cost is about the same regardless of the printer model. With the imaging unit, having  a life of 9k pages you're gonna be coughing up an extra $40 for every 4th toner replacement. Ultimately, I don't think I'll print enough to break even with the 2 piece unit so I went with this model. Also at the time of purchase this model was about half the cost of the 2835.",7,9.846467

Had to adjust the amount of ink that it puts on the paper by going into the Preferences and changing the quality to ""Fast Draft."" The cartridge is filled to the brim with as much ink as HP's XL.

I first took the tiny USB receiver and plugged it in (it neatly fits in the ring band for easy storage). My Windows 7 installed it almost immediately and off I went. There is included software, but I really don't like more things to add to my boot time.

A quick look at the teeny, tiny instruction manual helps me with the buttons and it was so easy. It fits very well on my index finger and it rather comfortable to wear and it stays put. They really thought this through and made it so you can do everything you can with a mouse with your thumb! I know, that's hard to believe. It is tough to describe, but the middle round button has a surface like a ""pointer stick"" on a laptop, but acts like a touchpad. Somehow, it is easy to move the cursor around to where you want on such a tiny surface. You can even move it very slowly. Press this middle button and it is a left click. Press to the left and it puts it in a scroll lock mode so that the middle surface scrolls. Press to the right for a right-click. Press to the bottom for a laser pointer!

There is a switch on the side that lets you choose between Off, Mouse mode and PowerPoint mode. The above was in Mouse mode. I tried PowerPoint mode and it makes the top button begin/end show, left and right control the slides and bottom is still a laser pointer. It all worked very well.

As for range, it isn't as far as some of the good remotes these days, but it did work about 30 feet, which is very reasonable. It has the now ubiquitous micro USB port for charging, which is great.

3219,"There is always some debate over whether to use refilled cartridges. These are not refilled, I am reviewing the original, sealed, HP labeled, retail packages. This has a different part number because it is a combo box/part uniting the three different color cartridges (no black, which generally wears out differently in normal use patterns.)
I keep going back to the originals because the precision of the color images so delights my eyes. I suppose I could get refilled cartridges for everyday use and just use originals for publication quality, but it turns out to be too much trouble for me. After all, I buy the HP laserjets for the incredible resolution and image quality in the first place. The cost is low enough per copy that I don't mind just buying original toner. Beware printing large expanses of color, though, when you don't really need it. The cost for toner after all is proportional to the amount put on the page.
I also find that it's not worth changing each color cartridge individually. By the time one runs out totally (way after I get the automated warning that colors are low), all the colors are low.
One thing that is worthwhile is redistributing the toner when coverage becomes uneven. Since each cartridge contains powdered toner, when it gets low, it can easily collect in one part of the cartridge rather than being distributed evenly. Since you can't see inside, you notice when a color (or black) fades in one part of the image (vertically down the page). Remove the cartridge, hold horizontally aligned, top up, in two hands at both ends. First shake from end to end (left and right) sharply back and forth, maintaining the cartridge in the horizontal plane. Now rotate forward and back a short distance, sharply, not gradually, about 10-12 times. The goal is to distribute the toner powder evenly across the bottom of the cartridge. You should get an additional number of perfect copies, quite a few the first time you do it, less each time you repeat until the cartridge is quite empty.
One last comment if you've read this far--why not refill cartridges? The genius of the cartridge in a laser printer is that it contains the toner, the drum, and the corona wire, basically all the disposables and wearables in a laser printer. This was designed by Canon and adopted from the beginning by HP for their laser printers. It is true that you can refill the toner, inspect and possibly replace the corona wire and the drum, and you should be good to go. But HP doesn't do it, and it is impossible to verify as a consumer that it has been done correctly with original quality components, so buying a third-party product, especially from an unknown distributor, is likely to work, but also risky. You can tell the drum is worn when printing quality across a whole page is uneven, and repeats at the diameter of the drum. You can tell the corona wire is weak or dirty when the image has places extending vertically that are hazy, weak even when you have enough toner powder, or contain glitches. That's why, when the price differential is great, it is possible to buy refilled cartridges knowing that you may occasionally get a bad one in one of these dimensions. The only real danger is if it is sealed incorrectly and you get toner spilled in the laser printer--that is a mess difficult to clean up. Today this seldom if ever happens as refilled cartridges come resealed just as they were when new. The other problems can be compensated for by having cartridges in reserve. If one fails or is flawed, you simply replace it and still come out ahead on price per copy. This is slightly more complicated with color laser printers as you have four separate cartridges to monitor, and also these are less commonly used, so it is harder to find refilled cartridges. It is easiest to do with black only laser printers as they tend to be common, and the printers can be as cheap as a single cartridge. (Warning, new printers may come with introductory cartridges that have less toner than the standard replacement cartridges.)",19,14.671326

3226,"If you are hunting for reviews of HP financial calculators, make certain you identify 'which' HP 17 you're looking at.  The original 17 was produced in Malaysia and has quite the following, even in the used market.  Reason?  Solidly built, utterly reliable and no surprises.  It squarely updgraded the HP12C calculator, though it has never had the following the 12c has; the 12c is absolutely deserving of the title 'iconic'.

Two things transpired in the past decade to give HP headaches in the calculator market:  first, their own internal struggles to find out where they themselves were heading as a corporation (and calculators contributed, certainly, but likely not in a large way) and, secondly, the shrinking market for calculators in general, and financial ones in particular.

Educational calculators still have a true market segment and HP and TI duke it out there; Casio also to a lesser extent.  But spreadsheets have changed the way many in the financial market run simulations.  That is NOT to say that there isn't a need for calculators; they offer a quick and easy method to obtain financial results, many times far quicker than their spreadsheet counterparts.  I think the market will always be there for a well-made financial calculator and most bankers and financial experts will always have a need for them.

That said, HP's follow on to the HP12C (the 'platinum') and the HP 17B+ were just dismal in every sense.  They had cheaper plastic cases, their buttons did not always register with every press and they didn't even follow their own keyboard coloring and layout patterns, which is beyond comprehension due to them creating the market itself for financial calculator layout!

I'm happy to report that someone, somewhere within the HP organization finally figured out the problems and have upgraded the HP17 to it's current status.  The keys not registering is FIXED.  The return to a familiar HP layout for the keys and the coloring of the keys is FIXED.  The 'cheapness' and low quality fix of the prior HP 17BII is FIXED.  The new HP 17BII+ even has a satisfying 'heft' to it, though they may have just put a weight in it to make it feel that way.  But it DOES feel like the HP 17 of old.

Make certain if you're looking at this calculator at big box stores that you do get the NEW model.  The faceplate is a blue-ish silver; the older models are brown or brown and gold.  And some of the interim models are still in the pipeline, so be absolutely certain you're getting the newest model; it's the ONLY one that has corrected the problems.

I'd have given this calculator 5 stars, but I'm taking one away since HP took so long to fix a problem that they should have taken responsibility for five years ago.",5,14.659405

Pic #1 = Printer installed within 5 minutes

Pic #2 = When the display is up, you can see the max height is just under 14-inches.
Note, the entire top is slanted, not flat. So no using the top as a storage space. Plus the display, even in down position, doesn't make this much flatter.

+ Not too heavy. Even with tennis elbow, I was able to lift and install this on my own.

+ I was surprised to find I didn't need to take 10-minutes to remove shipping tape or styrofoam from around and inside the printer. Even the ink cartridges were pre-installed.

+ Wireless connection was easy. I just followed the instruction manual

NOTE: When I first started printing the ink was all over the paper. I opened up the ink tray and on the ink cartridges there are some diagrams that basically say a) remove each ink, and b) shake 5 to 6 times. Once I did this with the black and each color, it printed perfectly

+ I took the included disc and installed the software on 4 PC's and 2 laptops all running WIndows 7 or Windows 10.
Software installed flawlessly and connected wireless to the printer without issue.

+ Printer isn't too loud. Our old inkjet would go into this fits of moving the heads back and forth as if warming up to print and it would be loud. This isn't like that. If your's Laserjet Pro is loud you may need to reset the ink cartridges. Once I did that it quieted down.

+ You can tell Windows what your printing preferences are. I set mine to double-sided printing and grayscale. If I ever want to print single-sided or in color I can select this when needed. Love how this printer by default can print 2-sided!!

+ Yes, this is overkill for the regular home user. Perfect for a small business, especially since the refill ink will run you $80 for the black and $300 for the color or close to it.

+ Printer is pretty fast

+ Seems to go into power-save mode if left on

3271,"I have had an Ooma Telo since 1 May 2011.  My major motivation was that I was pi**ed off with AT&T and wanted a divorce.  So, I popped for the $200 and hopefully trod into the brave new world of VOIP.  Ooma's instructions about how to get your DSL preserved (called ""dry loop"") while dropping your POTS service is not clear.  If you look at the ""user forum"" section on the Ooma website, you will see that lots of people have gotten bitten by this.

My dry looping was such a nightmare that I just dropped AT&T completely and went with Comcast Internet Comcast gives me 22Mb/s actual download, 4Mb/s actual upload.  My only point here is that whatever problems I might be having with my Ooma, they can't be explained away by having a slow internet connection.

Most of the time, the audio quality of service is fine, but many time's I'll have delays, echos, distortion.  Ooma's product support is pretty useless, so you are more or less on your own.  The user forum on the Ooma website is actually pretty good, so if you are reasonably technical you can get a lot of useful information.

The Ooma Telo doesn't handshake with my DECT6 phone very well, so every call is treated as a ""missed call"" and the ""missed call"" list on the phone must then be manually cleared.  Whose fault is that?  Panasonic or Ooma?  At this point I don't really care. It is just more time wasting for me.

I have spent hours trying to get my fax modem to work.  *99, *98, DSL filter, P, PP, you name it.  No joy.  I now resort to using a ""faxzero"" like service.  So much for cost savings.

So I'm now 3 months into this noble experiment.  Unless I value my time at less than $0.29 per hour, I am *never* going to see any savings.  And the audio quality is often good, but not infrequently it is inferior to a POTS land land.  And I wistfully remember when I could send faxes.  This is not the worst product I have ever bought, but it definitely was a mistake, and if I had it to do over again, I would just suck it up and tolerate getting gouged by AT&T.

It is a wise person who learns from other people's mistakes, rather than having to make his own. Are you a wise person?

Update Aug 17, 2011.  The entire Ooma system is down.  According to Ooma support, they *might* be up in a few hours.  You don't do this kind of thing and stay in the telecom business",3,9.330568

3273,"However, I must say, the instructions on the set-up could be easier. I am pretty computer savvy and pride myself on being able to follow directions very well, but this set-up was a challenge! The set-up I am referring to is the wireless set-up. It took me almost two hours of try, try, again before I finally stumbled upon the right way to do it, no thanks to the directions. It was easier to set-up the wireless printing on my iPhone than my computer!

But, once all was hooked up correctly, the printer works great. Very quiet compared to my last printer. I love the printing from my iPhone! When using the photo paper (3 sample sheets 4 X 6 come with it) my husband couldn't believe that I had printed them from my phone! They looked that good.

Plus, I absolutely LOVE the red color! So tired of the same old black or gray printers! How blah! This looks so good sitting out in the open and matches my office decor.

Would recommend.

As far as people complaining about the size of the paper feed; I am using this for home. I won't go through 80 sheets of paper in a month! So, I have no problem with the size of the paper tray at all.

Pros:  Easy to use. Prints great. Photo quality prints. Beautiful color. Looks sleek. Love the hidden paper trays.
Cons:  Instructions for wireless set-up could be easier to follow.",9,6.491779
3274,"Don't let the title fool you.  I'm not totally dissatisfied with the phone.  I bought the base unit and one extension handset, and there's a lot to love about the phone.  Unfortunately, the little things were overlooked, hindering this from being absolute perfection.  Instead of wasting your time with a drawn out review, I'll bullet it out for you and let you make your own decision.

First some background.  I've been a VTech fan for years, stemming back to the old 900MHz days and that ugly clear green phone I had that required the DSL filters to work correctly.  I had a VTech i5871 (I think that's the model number) for YEARS....upwards of 6 if I recall, and it served me faithfully; at least the color handset extension did (which ended up becoming my primary, since the default black and white handset's buttons have a flaw where they won't press anymore after some use).  That phone had it all: Great charging, headset jack, color screen, picture uploads via USB, recordable ringtones, belt clip, voicemail, caller ID, etc.  The phone wasn't perfect; it didn't have a call timer (a minor nitpick) nor did it have a way to clear all voicemails at once without listening to them one by one, even through killing power (not so minor a nitpick).  I could overlook these, as the phone itself was of the utmost top quality.  However it was later discontinued by VTech, and I needed a phone with one extra extension as I have a significantly larger place than I used to.  Enter this model.

For reference, I bought this from BBuy, not Amazon, because for whatever reason Amazon.com does not want to stock this model or its accessory, and I'm not keen on paying ~$55 for shipping.  I want to throw this disclaimer: I acknowledge that some of my CONS below may be due to ignorance on how to use the device, but I scoured both the manual and the VTech website and could not find out how these are done.

** PROS **
- The form factor is very modern and upscale.  You'd think it would be more expensive than it is.

- 65K color backscreen which supports pictures and animations.
- Lots of various ringers.  Some of the default ones are actually quite fabulous.

- Call Timer!!

- Bluetooth allows you to connect a cell phone and make calls using your cell plan or take cell calls using your home phone, or link up a Bluetooth headset.

- Audio quality is very good; very little white noise can be heard in the background or on the speakerphone.

- Great range.  My place is 967 square feet and I get crystal clear reception no matter where I happen to be.

- Recordable ringers.

** CONS **
- No standard headset jack.  Come on VTech, you've had standard headset jacks on your phones for nearly a decade; what's the problem here?? This is the second VTech I've purchased where this feature was not available.  ""Just use a BT headset!!!"" you say?  Well....

- Bluetooth headset is only supported FROM THE BASE.  Meaning I can pair it to the base and if I'm just calling a friend or something, that works great, but I can't pair it to any of the handsets, so I can't really move anywhere.  I also can't use it in the other room.  What if I'm in the bedroom and need to call someone?  I can't use the headset, because I have to go to the base to dial the call.  ""Just dial the call from the handset and transfer it to the base!!"" you say?  Well....

- Inability to transfer calls from one handset to another or from handset to base.  I'm literally appalled by the absence of this feature.  What's the point of having these extensions if I can't send calls to them???? This has been a basic selling point of these expandable phones for YEARS.

- Inability to load your own pictures (this is a nitpick).  My old VTech could do it; what's the problem here???

- Inability to set your area code (this is a nitpick).  Meaning, if I set a specific area code, then I can isolate local calls, so when I dial them back the phone should not append 1+area code, only the 7 digits.  The problem with this is that Caller ID does not always include the 1; in fact, rarely does it.  So I have to force the phone to ""manipulate"" the number when I'm calling them back.

- Extension handsets require manual registration (This is a nitpick).  My old VTech picked up new extensions automatically and assigned them in order.  What's the problem here???

- Must force the base to send audio to the BT headset.  Err, this defeats the purpose of using a headset.  Headsets have the built-in ability to answer and terminate calls automatically; also, if I pair a headset I expect the phone to ALWAYS send audio to it until I turn the headset off or unpair it; since I'm forced to use the base for the headset, that means I always have to be sitting near the base when using the headset which, of course, defeats the purpose of using the headset when I might as well use speaker or a handset.  Basically, the headset is useless as implemented.

- VTech's refusal to implement backwards compatibility even though it's obvious that the same radios are used in these phones.  If I could use the older extension model on this I'd be ecstatic, since I know I could use that phone whenever I needed headset flexibility.  But noooo....

Again, I want to stress that I do like the phone, I just wish VTech had gone all the way with its true potential.  But that's way too many CONS for me, which is why I had to ding them two stars.  The phone doesn't suck, it's just not as great as it clearly should and could have been.

UPDATE: Another negative.  The primary handset refuses to hold a charge no matter what I do.  I believe it's a symptom that has long affected VTech phones...or rather, the batteries VTech chooses to use, NiMH, Nickel Metal Hydride.  That battery technology is poor for ""overcharging"" - that is, if you leave it on the charger without allowing it to discharge, eventually the battery will be rendered useless.  That's why a lot of long-term-tech vendors have moved to LiIon - Lithium Ion - battery tech, as it doesn't suffer from that defect (though LiIon suffers from something totally different...it can only be charged a finite number of times and should not be discharged).

So in summary, the battery is useless and must be replaced.  It says use VTech batteries only, but since the connector is a standard one, I'm going to see if I can track down a LiIon battery to replace this one.",101,9.547648

3278,"I make and sell greeting cards to benefit our local library and buy almost all of my paper and envelope supplies from Paper-Papers, now.

I use this lovely blue as a background on my most popular wedding (please see customer image).  I also used it for the die-cuts on the corner of the card.

3283,"In the 80s and early 90s, there were 4 color pens made by Bic, Pentech and other brands.  Bic had the regular blue, black, red and green inks, while Pentech had the fun colors-pink, purple, green, and turquoise in one, and teal, burgundy, orange, and green-blue in another.  They were called Fireworks pens and I remember how much fun they were to collect.  I remember picking out a few packages in stores with my mom.  I used them to write letters, draw, and even do schoolwork with (when it was allowed-not all teachers liked colorful ink).  I usually used the green ink for school because it was my least favorite color and saved the better ones for my letters.  My cousin had them too, and we wrote many letters using our pens.  I loved the vibrant colors and clicking the various switches to alternate inks.  As you can see I have a lot of memories attached to these pens.  I still have the pens, whether they write or not, as a keepsake from childhood.  I loved them and was sad when they were discontinued.  Bic continued to make the regular colors, but I missed the fun.

Now they have the Fashion Colors pen.  This has pink, purple, teal blue and green ink, similar to the Shimmers pens.  Like the Shimmers, the green ink is very light, purple is good; but they've made a couple of nice changes.  Pink is a darker shade than in previous Bic pens.  It's bolder and I like it a lot.  The blue is more teal rather than the usual turquoise.  The 2-pack I opened had a difference in writing though--one writes really great and the other skips a little.  It's not a dud, just not as good.

The better one writes really smooth and doesn't leave ink blobs on the paper.  Overall, the pink and blue write better than the Shimmers.  I like having 4 colors in one retractable pen, easy to change with the click of a switch.  The regular colors are refillable, but I don't think these are.  It would be nice if they were.  The barrel of the pen is comfortable to hold, and comes in half white and half green-a nice shade of lime green.  Also good is that they are made in France, not China or Mexico.

As soon as I started using one of these, a flood of memories came back.  Now with the internet and everyone e-mailing, the art of writing a letter is pretty much gone save for a few individuals who keep it up.  Using this pen made me wish I still had a pen pal like I did as a child.  The memories alone were worth the purchase.  But it is a good, sturdy pen for everyday use.  I carry one in my purse for taking notes.

If you remember using the 4-in-one pens in the 80s, this is a nice blast from the past.  Also convenient if you like to use colored inks and want to carry just one pen around.  5 stars all the way, just wish they came in a 5 pack.",39,14.592109

The holder is rather light because it is hollow, however, I have not had any problems with the holder tilting, even when fully loaded with heavy-duty construction paper. In theory, the holder could be made heavier by placing a stone inside of it, since the bottom is made of rubber which can easily be removed. Along those lines, it could also be used as a secret compartment. The rubber bottom also prevents the holder from sliding around, but I would personally prefer it to be a little more grippy. One of these holders that I own is aesthetically unpleasing because one side of the holders looks melted or smoothed down. This does not affect its ability to hold papers, however, so I am perfectly happy. I would repurchase this item.

When you buy a ""compatible"" cartridge, it will often look quite different from the OEM cartridge. This cartridge is no exception. It fits perfectly into the printer, but the design of the cartridge is different enough to be easily identifiable as a non-OEM cartridge. In this case the design is preferred since the cartridge I got had a, more or less clear back panel that allowed me to actually see the toner inside the cartridge. This is nice because for the first time I was able to actually see how much toner is inside the cartridge, and how much might be left once the printer alerts me that a toner cartridge is getting low.

Print quality is as far as I can tell exactly the same as using the more expensive Brother cartridges.",6,12.293115
3286,"I finally had to break down and replace the Siemens 2420 phone system I have been using since they first came out. My needs are simple, expandable cordless phone system, base and seven handsets minimum, 2-line, 5.8 ghz, digital, useable/sharable phonebook and answer machine or seamless connection to phone company voice mail and finally reasonable price. The 2-line/eight unit requirement eliminated Panasonic. The usable/sharable phone book eliminated Motorola (you would not believe how primitive theirs was). Anyway, to make a long difficult journey much shorter I eliminated everyone except Uniden. I really wanted to wait until the new model is released this summer, but the Siemens decided to die.

I work out of my home so I bought the TRU8866 and seven TCX905 handsets. Setting up the TRU8866 was simplicity itself. Charge the handset, read the manual, decide what settings and options you wanted to use, input those settings, use the phone.

After living with the system for several weeks I have the following observations:

Pro: Great clarity and range, easy to program, simple to use, small size, clean apperance, easily read LCD's, program phonebook into one phone and then transmit it to all the other handsets and base, the handsets all have a small led that flashes when there is voicemail, good speaker phones in the base and the handsets.

Cons: Handset settings such as individual ringer tones, voicemail numbers, and second numbers for phonebook entries must be re-entered on each handset. The voicemail indication for the TRU8866 is the entire LCD screen lights up and stays lit. I personally do not care for the bright orange LCD screen color, perhaps something like the Timex Indiglo would be nicer.

Perhaps the biggest detraction is the lack of a built in answer machine. It works well with the Bell South Voicemail system but that costs over seven dollars per month for two lines and is far more awkward to use than the Siemens system I just trashed.

I can carry a handset to houses up the street and still have a connection, great range. The hum induced in the Siemens by the wireless computer network is totally eliminated by the 5.8 ghz frequency.

The only feature that I cannot imagine using is the ""Direct Connect"". With this you can carry two handsets to the mall or other outing and maintain contact between the two handsets (not your base station) by using them as two way radios.

All in all a well thought out system. Now if it just lasts as long as the Siemens it replaces......",15,14.641909

I've been using the chair for about 3 weeks now and with regards to back pain elimination- absolutely worth the money.  I also liked that assembly was fairly simple and that most parts were already assembled prior to them packaging it.  If all components are working as they should, assembly time is maybe 10 minutes.  I'm also going from a leather chair in a hot climate, to a mesh chair which makes it so my back no longer sweats during the day- absolutely love that as well.

The one star drop is for their customer service:
- The chair's hydraulic height adjustment and forward tilt mechanisms did not work when I got the chair.  I had to go in and take the gear cover off and found that a couple of the wires had become disconnected, making it so that the hydraulic lift and forward tilt functions weren't working.

3308,"Feels solid. Roughly the size of a half strip desk stapler. Aligns easily for flat or corner staple. Does not take much strength, even for maximum load. Whether 2 or more pages, connections hold. Helps to press crimp flat with fingers, though not necessary. Strength of crimp is narrow strip of paper, maybe 1/8 inch wide. Staples are a lot stronger but crimps are strong enough for normal handling. Pages can be intentionally separated with care. Easier than with staples. And there's no staple to dispose of. Restapling must be away from original crimp. Holes look bigger than expected, but are fine for actual use. Crimps are more visible than staples, but less visible and intrusive than paper clips. Very handy for attaching working documents, especially where staples would be too much bother. There is a catch tray, easily emptied, that's not really needed. I have seen no ""dust"" or loose paper.",2,6.1937017

3311,I can see why this table has so many great reviews. You can add mine to the list! I wanted a table for in front of my living room chair when I work on my counted cross stitch and needlepoint projects etc. This is perfect!! The top is white with some tiny flecks of gray in it. It is a very sturdy table and heavier than I expected it to be. Once set up to the height you want it is perfect!! Plenty of leg and foot space in between the bars on the floor too. So it is a comfortable table to have in front of you.,2,5.2450767
3312,"The faux leather and bold stitching are something I'd never choose, but of all the caddies available, this one serves well for a couple of reasons.  I actually found the white stitching so unlovely, I colored over it with a magic marker, which to my eye, helps a little.  Just personal preference and I suppose a real leather covering would be sufficiently expensive to deter interest, but this `leather' seems a poor imitation at best. That said, however, the caddy is fully functional at not only holding my many remotes, but also keeping my Netflix movies in one place, which is a benefit I didn't expect.

While the center section is fine for a DVD or two in its case, the Netflix disks aren't as easily retrievable due to the height of the center section, but still, I really appreciate having one central place to keep them and the envelopes fit fine.

Other than the unexpected benefit of central storage for the movies, I'm very pleased with the size of the four remote holding slots.  I actually have six remotes to keep track of, but fortunately, the one for the radio and the one for the local channel antenna are small enough that they can share a slot with the local channel box remote, which is slim.  The slots in this caddy are more generous than others I've seen or tried.  Not only can the smaller remotes share a slot, my newest cable remote, which is especially large and thick, still fits easily.  That remote is backed by some rubbery feeling material that I guess is supposed to make it less likely to slide off an uneven surface, but would also make it difficult to slide into a narrow caddy slot.  This caddy's slots are great. An extra added benefit is that the slots are lined with some fabric like material that would offer some protection to the remote if needed, but more practically eliminates the noise of remotes rattling around in there when the caddy is moved or when one is dropped in its slot.

The fact that the caddy revolves is nice, but not crucial.  I wouldn't choose it just for that, but if you have many remotes or particularly large ones, this is a good choice.",24,7.970479

3317,"If you have the Westcott Trimmer you already know these blades last and are of the finest quality. The price of the pair, cutter and scorer, is less than paying for just cutters in a twin pack. This is the way to buy replacements even if you don't need the new scorer.

These titanium blades cut through paper like slicing warm butter. Really. I have even cut 110# card stock and it takes only slight pressure. The blades allow for forward or reverse cutting, doubling the length of the blades use. With the Westcott's Paper Trimmer, I use the 12"", you can even life the cutter's carriage and press down the blade in the middle of a sheet of paper for cutting out thin mattes for cards, scrap-booking, and my primary use: genealogy folder page insertions and photos.

As a retired art teacher, I've used many types and levels of paper cutters. This is one of the best, especially if your need is for paper in the 20# down to newsprint strength.
As with all cutting tools, protect the blade. If cared for, they last a long time and work easily.

3318,"This lap desk is nice in the regard that it is light and has a tube cushion on top and bottom rather than one big cushion that would be uncomfortable on the lap. The desk is small, which for me is nice because I use a wireless mouse that sits on the arm of my chair. It would not work for anyone wanting to use the surface of the desk for a mouse unless their lap top is really tiny.

What is disappointing is that the surface is slick. There is absolutely nothing to hold the computer in place so the first time I set it down, the computer started sliding off and would have hit the floor had I not caught it.

I solved the problem by grabbing a piece of that rubberized shelving paper specifically made to keep things from sliding around so all works fine.

True, this is a low cost option so one can't expect top quality, but it's reasonable to expect some safeguards for the computer given it is a portable desk, such as at least a textured surface in the center to more securely hold the laptop.",246,6.727024

Additionally, the green ""jade"" ball at the top of the cap is loose, and jiggles when you write.  I am not sure if that is the intended design --so that the ball moves and changes color in the light-- or if my particular pen was made that way.  It's still an eye-catching pen, and for the price, it's a really nice item for a collector.",12,5.2347865
3322,"Somebody got these for our office copier areas, and they instantly became the staplers of choice amongst staff.  We have people who will come and use them instead of the ones on their desks.  I liked it so much, I bought one of my own for the office, and one for home.

There's no extra forcing pressure needed regardless of the number of pages.  It feels like an electric punching action, though it isn't.  You just press and it does the job.

With the recommended staples, this stapler promises to punch 25 pages with ease.  I find it'll do up to 30.

(UPDATE!) - Two years later, I dropped the stapler (onto carpet) and the metal arm fractured!  A triangle-shaped chunk from the left side just where the rubber top meets the body broke off.  It still worked for a couple of weeks, but eventually the metal body fractured across the entire arm, rendering it useless.

But prior to that, the thing worked flawlessly.  Never jammed once in roughly 6,000 staples.",6,6.9429417

Where it shines is in the Airprint and Cloud printing arena.  I found these easy to setup and I can now print from just about anywhere and from my iPad and iPhone.  These features were worth the upgrade.

Like similar Canon printers it uses small easily replaceable cartridges.  And like similar Canon printers it really goes through the ink cartridges.  This is not an office printer for large printing jobs.  It would get very expensive considering the cost of ink.  I usually keep a stack of extra cartridges available.  It does have the advantage of needing to change only one color cartridge versus other printers which house multiple colors in one tank.

3332,"The PIXMA PRO-1 Professional Inkjet Printer is an amazing piece of equipment for the professional photographer or for the amateur who wants professional quality prints. I recently reviewed the Canon PIXMA PRO-100 and was delighted with the prints, however, comparing the same prints done on the PIXMA PRO-1, there was a definition and depth of color that exceeded the PIXMA PRO-100. My husband does wild bird photography and the results were nothing short of amazing. While the PIXMA PRO-100 has eight cartridges, the PIXMA PRO-1 comes with a full set of  12 LUCIA pigment ink system cartridges to ensure higher levels of color accuracy and stunning detail. While I have tested this unit only on color prints, there are as well five monochrome inks to raise your level of professional print quality when creating the dramatic expression of grayscale photography.

Other features include built-in Ethernet connection (cable not supplied) allows multiple users to seamlessly print from several networked computers in any environment.

The PIXMA PRO-1 also offers two-way paper feeding and professional photo printing on a variety of Fine Art and Glossy Photo Papers.  That said, there are a few considerations that should be mentioned before you spring for this printer.

Even thought the cartridges are stated to be 2  times larger than conventional cartridges, they use an incredible amount of ink, approximately 25% of each cartridge just to prime the printer head. Other reviewers write of getting 30 13 x 19 prints out of the cartridges before they go empty, and a full set of replacements with shipping and tax can run $430. So as amazing as this printer is, it can be very pricy to operate if printing photographs and selling them is not your business.

The printer is huge (27"" x 9.5"" x 18.5"" and weighs about 75 pounds) and requires a table to set it on. Also, you need to leave some access in the rear of the printer. I have mine sitting on half of a six-foot table in my office.

The printer can be set up to use USB or Ethernet connected to a switch/router. (Note: I needed to use both USB and Ethernet to configure the software). Since the laptop this printer is connected to has no unused USB ports and since I wanted to connect to a home network, I opted for the Ethernet hookup. You choose your desired connection during the set-up process, however, you'll need to have both cables on hand since they aren't supplied.

Installation took approximately 40 minutes plus additional time to install the ink cartridges and print head, which took 20 minutes to prime. I had trouble getting my system to recognize the additional printer, but after connecting both USB and Ethernet cables, I was able to complete the task. The included quick start and User's Manual detailed each operation so the setup is simple, even for a beginner. There's  a toll-free live technical support number (1-800-OK-CANON) in case you need additional help.

In conclusion, I certainly recommend this printer, but be aware that it is expensive to maintain. Others have suggested that you should run a print at least every week or so to keep the print head from requiring additional priming. This will save on the amount of ink used as well as help preventing clogging and the need to clean the head.

Due to the comb's shape, my Fellows comb binding machine couldn't open them easily.  It was quite a struggle to get them opened; but once I did, they worked fine.  I have to say that I found it odd that both my binding machine (which is supposed to be able to handle this size comb)  and these combs were both made by Fellows; yet they aren't truly compatible.  One thing I like about these combs is that the two end spines have notches, which lock into a slot on the solid part of the comb.

I had no idea they had come down in price so much (they were in the thousands back when I paid any attention to them).

Anyhow, SO happy with this printer. It works every single time I turn it on to use it. I live in a very dry climate now so no more worrying about ink drying up - it uses dry toner. It prints double-sided and it also has built in wireless so I don't even have any cables running to it from my computers. I couldn't be happier with this thing, especially for the price. One thing to note, however, is that the toner cartridges are a little more expensive than ink jet but on the plus side of that, Brother claims an average of 1200 pages from that, which is much more than you would ever get out of a black ink cartridge.",45,5.6020813

The printer itself? I've had a long and glorious relationship with a Samsung B&W Laser. It supports AirPrint, it was super easy to set up, it caused problems with none of my devices, it had great paper capacity, it was reasonably quiet, and reasonably fast. It was everything I wanted in a printer, and we were happy together. We still are! But mostly because the B&W doesn't know about the C430W, which is everything it is but in glorious glorious color. You're not going to print something that looks like a processed photograph with this, but neither are you going to produce the sort of washed out effect so often attributable to inkjets on lighter stocks. Color laser printing was a largely unachievable tech for home users not all that long ago, and not only has Samsung made it reasonably economical, but they've smartly applied everything that made the rest of their printer line great to this one as well.

If the toner costs don't scare you off, and you value the option to introduce color to your prints without the issues that come with ink (bleeding, washed out colors, solubility, etc.), then I'm simply not aware of where or how you can do better than this one in terms of performance and bang for the buck.",4,7.434338

I've just spent a couple of hours putting these labels on the more commonly ""borrowed"" items. With my name on them, I think they're much more likely to boomerang back my way (I now keep a notebook in the garage to keep track of tools lent out as well).

We also have about 20 trees in the orchard, and I got some plastic ""nametags"" for them (like conversation bubbles with spikes). Problem was, even though I'd write the name of the tree (""grand gala apple"" etc.) on them with a permanent marker, after a few months in the sun, the name was no more. So I'm going to try these labels, stuck to the plastic. The instructions say that they'll stick to metal and just about anything -- including ""rough"" plastic, so I took my Dremel and a sanding head and scuffed the plastic before I stuck the label on. I've written on them in permanent marker again (what else are you going to do?), and this time I've turned the writing away from the sun. Hopefully this will work. I'll return at some point to update the experiment.

3371,"I am a volunteer business manager for a small nonprofit public charity (read financially challenged!). We need to keep track of volunteer time, employee time and client attendance times. We bought the ICON time clock primarily because of the low cost, and that it could be connected to the internet.

It doesn't have a wireless interface so we also bought the Iogear GWU627 client adapter (ethernet to wi-fi), also based on cost.

Setup difficulties: I don't which device was responsible for the difficulties. The client adapter worked fine (after some difficulty, helped by customer service) when conneted to a laptop using the client adapter ethernet cable. But when connected to the time clock it failed with a wide variety of strange symptoms, with exactly the same cables in exactly the same location. I tried various locations, including next to the laptop where the adapter worked, but no joy. Then I tried using the 15 foot ethernet cable that came with the time clock. It worked and in all locations! I would suspect the cable that came with the adapter except for the fact that it worked with the laptop; everything else is the same. ??? I am using the USB cable plugged into the time clock to power the adapter. I spent 2 days experimenting and talking on the phone. RATS!

What I don't like and the ads don't tell you:
1. You can't assign the ID numbers, you have to use the disjointed (023, 067, 101, etc.)  pre-assigned numbers. I want to assign numbers based on the class, e.g. employee, volunteer, client. But I can't. A >$100 upgrade is required to do this.
2. A power failure erases the date/time info. Very inconvient. Well, this may only be before you start entering employees. I just tried it and it did not loose the date/time or employee info.
3. It is designed for wall mounting: the cables come out the bottom if mounted vertically on the wall. If horizontal, as on a table, the cables come out the front making for a messy installation. If you look closely at the photo, you can infer a horizontal mounting problem. I didn't so will have to make arrangements for a vertical installation.
4. Upgrades are expensive! If you want to pick your own ID #s, get the RTC-1000. You will save >$20 and get 50 employee capability into the bargain, as well as better software capability.
5. This isn't the fault of the time clock, but Amazon doesn't sell all the upgrades to this device. There seems to be a wide price differential among vendors who do sell the upgrades. Caveat Emptor!

What I do like:
1. The display is bright and easy to read.
2. It comes with a QuickBooks interface. We use QuickBooks. I haven't tried this yet. Will provide an update later.
3. The ethernet access is great! Easy to use.
4. The user manual that comes with it is easy to read and appears complete.
5. The GUI is good, easy to understand and navigate.

Reserving judgement:
1. reports.
2. Quick Books interface.
3. other features I haven't tried.

Feb 10, 2012
We have been using the clock for over a month now. Would I have bought it if I knew then what I know now? NO. I would have bought the RTC-1000 or a competitor; see below for why.

What I like: Color. The reports make good use of color. You can edit the times and provide an explanation of why it was edited. The children (clients) find it easy to use, and seem to enjoy clocking in and out. It is a big improvement over the previous paper and pencil system. You can select either minutes or hundreths of an hour. The export facility is somewhat useful but requires a lot of unnecessary editing. Customer support was prompt and courteous, and they could actually speak English! I contacted them by email. They called me on the phone and talked me through the problem.

What I don't like: Lots of irritating limitations. Explanations below. A word of explanation. It seems that the PRO and RTC-1000 are the same hardware. The software in the PRO is partially disabled. The upgrade I mention below consisted of a key to enter. When I did so, the PRO became an RTC-1000.

I was forced to upgrade to the RTC-1000 for $110 because of the extreme limitations of the base (PRO) clock. These include only 25 employees (which I knew) before buying the clock, but the board of directors decided we should include the clients which put us over the 25 limit. If you have any possibility of needing more than 25 ""employees,"" or a better reporting capability, buy the RTC100. The street price of the RTC-1000 is less than the PRO plus upgrade. And you can start out assigning your choice of ID numbers.

Also, the base unit (PRO) has no custom reporting capability. The manufacturer doesn't mention this. A SEVERE limitation! And you can not assign custom employee numbers, you are stuck with the set provided. They must be exactly 3 digits long.

The upgrade, RTC-1000, has a (very limited) custom report capability. You can select the date range of the report and who to include, period. Nothing else. Can't change which columns to include. The date selection is clumsy and hard to use. For example, when you select custom report and custom date range you are presented with, in our case, a calendar for December 2011. You can step forward or back by one month or one year. When you select ending date you are presented with December 2012 instead of the next pay period. It would be helpful if the clock would ""remember"" the last beginning and ending dates and use that as a possible default, or use the current pay period as a default. A set of programmable preferences would be a big asset. (Hint to product manager: look at Quick Books.)

Times must be entered as hh:mm with a suffix of either a or p. It requires the colon (ugh!) and does not understand hours in the range of 13-24. So to enter 1301  you have totype in 01:01p. The leading zero is required. Not time efficient. I hate having to enter the colon as it is not on my numeric keypad; I have to take my hand off the numeric pad to press the shift key and the colon. When entering a time the software should be smart enough to regard the colon as optional. I was a software engineer for 40 years, and this kind of lazy programming is inexcusable. There are canned routines that will do this, all you have to do is use them! RATS!

I do not like the price scheme of this company. They sell you the bare bones that just barely meets the advertised capabilities and then have expensive upgrades for the capabilities you really need. And omit mentioning all the limitations.

One of the reasons I chose this clock is because of the Quick Books interface. I had difficulty setting it up because of poor instructions. The instructions do not mention Windows 7, only XP and Vista. I emailed support and got the answer that should have been in the instructions. The support person was prompt and courteous. Also, there were mysterious error messages about improper employee setup. I managed to correct these by extensive trial and error; no guidance from the instructions. I haven't used the interface to QB because we have clients and volunteers mixed in with the employees, and so far I haven't been able to figure out how to select only the employees. See below for other selection issues.

The export to excel (CSV) feature is disapointing. It has multiple empty columns that I find annoying, and as a result pushes lots of information off screen to the right. So it requires LOTS of editing to make it useful. There appears to be no way to select what information is exported - you get everything all the time, which leads to more editing. The format does not follow that of QB, so you can't go that route without extensive editing. In our case it is quicker to read the report and enter the data manually in QB.

One of the really annoying things about the base unit (PRO) is that the employee ID numbers are fixed. And the marketing info doesn't tell you about this. I wanted to assign ID numbers by employee, clien, and volunteer so I could get all of any given group easily by selecting that range of numbers. Can't do it. The RTC-1000 claims you can do this, but I haven't tried it yet. I don't want to change the clients' numbers. So my plan is to start assigning new personnel numbers using the range scheme.

Reports use a set of flags. Every entry/exit entry gets a L on a separate line from the other data. Sometimes there is an H with it which I take to me a high number of hours. I don't know what the L is for. Why does it have to be on a separate line? This makes the report about twice as long as it needs to be.",29,14.135453

3387,"I have no problems with the text or photo quality of this printer.  Both are great.  However, as others have stated, the ink use on this printer is abnormally high.  EXPECT TO SPEND FAR MORE than you have on other printers.

More important to me though is its INABILITY TO PRODUCE SIPLE 2-SIDED PRINTING.  Here are my 2 major problems related to 2-sided printing.

First, once you've gone through the significant ordeal of finding the correct driver for Mac computers (you have to search on their website and its not immediately apparent which is the correct driver), you'll find that the printer does not support duplex (2-sided) printing on Macs.  Of course, at this point you've already gone through the set-up and search for drivers.  Okay, maybe you can deal with that inconvenience.

Second, it fails when you print on one side of paper, turn the sheets over, and print on the other side.  In my experience, I lose about 40% of the first printed pages when I try to print on the second side.  I wondered if it might be that the pages stick together in some way because the ink has not sufficiently dried.  So, I've waited 15 minutes before printing the second side; I've waiting an hour before printing the second side.  I've waiting overnight before printing the second side - all with the same significant failure.

So, what do I mean by failure?  The pages stick together as they pass through the printer.  As many as 3 stick together at a time.  Although they are stuck together, they do not pass through the printer evenly.  Because of this, 2 pages are ruined because they have portions of the second side printed (the third page is unusually left without any printing on the second side).  As a result, I have to print far more of the first page than what are needed just to get the desired number of complete 2-sided documents.

When I consider the excessive ink usage on regular one-sided printing along with the requirement for overprinting of the first page required for 2-sided printing, the result is the most expense I've ever had for any printer by a factor of 2.  And this does include the 40% extra paper I have to use in 2-sided printing because of having to overprint the first page.

Because of these problems, I urge all Mac users and those who do frequent 2-sided printing to run away from this machine.",6,10.301943

Finally I found it meant the offline web page, and after poking it several times, some additional drivers were downloaded, and now I can print wirelessly, at least from my PC.  Haven't tried Cloud Print yet.  Also, the printer takes a long time to start up and print after sleeping, but once it does it is fast and clear and pretty in its printing.

The color output was amazing clear with very good color. Most output I have done so far was on general or graphics setting, but I did do a couple of images on laser photo paper at the photo setting. Output isn't the same as a high-end photo inkjet, but definitely much better than I would have expected for laser.

Scanning wirelessly works, too, with Windows 32bit or 64bit.  32bit TWAIN drivers are included and WIA scanning is available on 32bit & 64bit Windows.  Some 32bit apps can access the TWAIN when running on 64bit Windows.

Only complaint is an old one , but not specific to this printer. Printer companies have been putting chips in cartridges for years that seem to disable the printer at a random page count to replace the cartridge. Most of the time, it really isn't out of ink or toner.

Fortunately on this Canon laser, there is an option on the LCD to keep printing when this occurs.  I can keep printing until the toner really IS out. What I found amazing is that I got almost another 1000 pages from the black toner.  Some people would have ended up throwing that away.

So far, I have been extremely happy with this purchase.

Sticking to Mechanical Pencils I bought myself a Uni ""Kuru Toga"" Pencil in 0.3mm, and loved it.  I saw this...

Went and reread the packaging... 100% Japanese but looking at the little graphics it seemed to me, and it worked out, that you extend the metal lead sleeve and you write with the sleeve touching the paper, and as you write and use the lead up (FYI, smaller diameter leads wear quicker) the sleeve retracts... When it retracts all the way you click the plunger and start again!  Works like a charm! And how's writing with such fine lead? Amazing!  Lines are so crisp and clear, no smudging.  I love the idea!

There is a stop guard on the non-sharp end to prevent the metal piece that has a tiny blade at the top from falling out, and it has a retractable blade.

With 12 of them included in a small box, there are enough of them to carry one in my purse, in my car, and keep one in a drawer in every room in the house.

Thermal Laminator unit
Instruction Sheet
Two 9x11.5 inch lamination pouches

The unit itself has a low profile when the input tray is not extended.  It is about sixteen inches wide  Only about 3 1/2 inches high and 3 1/2 inches long although the size listed in the description is a bit wider and longer.  The cord stores in the bottom part of the unit, wrapped around two concealed posts.  The electric is about 4 1/2 feet long.

This is not my first laminator so I've had some experience with what you shouldn't laminate.  The leaflet does explain that you shouldn't laminate currency, social security cards, thermal papers, stamps, credit cards, cards with a magnetic strip, sharp objects, unheatable plastic, historically significant papers or one of a kind items unless laminating an item is part of a craft project. Some of the things you shouldn't laminate is due to legal reasons-- like the social security card, birth certificates, currency and stamps-- and some are a problem due to the reaction to the heat which could damage the unit. It is very good for producing advertising items.  I like to make up bookmarks with the company name, laminate them and hand them out with my card.

The 3 mil setting is for laminating lighter weight items or plain paper.  For heavier card stock or photo paper use the 5 mil setting.  Plug the unit in and turn the power on.  Wait for the ready light to come on.  The laminator pouches are not real pouches.  They are plastic that is folded in half so three ends are open.  Place the item to be laminated inside the pouch.  Insert the sealed end of the pouch in the laminator and wait until it catches and starts pulling the pouch and its contents.

3406,"This is an interesting ink from Noodler's.  I had read great reviews on other sites/forums about the color, and had to try it.

My first impression was that it was filled to the very, very top.  I opened the bottle and there was this deep orange color that was unexpected, I thought the ink itself would be lighter in color, but no bother.  Loaded it up into a newer Sheaffer Agio and got to writing.

I used it in that pen for about a week, fine nib with a converter.  The ink was very thin compared to Noodler's American Eel Black.  It flowed nicely, although wasn't as consistent in opacity/darkness as I was hoping.  Perhaps it was the papers I use (standard office paper, notebooks, etc, nothing fancy here) but it would consistently be darker at the beginning and endings of letters and words.  Not really bad, and not gloppy or bleeding, but just darker.  On the second loading of ink I made sure to really shake the bottle up and make sure there wasn't any pigment settled to the bottom and I don't think it made a difference.

The color itself is cool.  It's bright and jumps off the page, especially when I would take notes mixed with black or a navy blue, the two (or three) contrast beautifully.

I'm going to try this in a few of my other pens and see how it flows, if it's any better.  I had an issue with it leaking out the back of the Sheaffer's converter, which I did not experience with the black.  Again, I think the thinner ink exploited a problem with the converter that was already there, I just have to re-seal the threads.  So really not a strike against the ink, just an observation.  Will come back and update once I've had a bit more experience with this ink.

Overall, I recommend buying a bottle and trying it out.  As I say the color is bright and full of energy, definitely worth having in your lineup.",2,8.487453

1. Free Uninterruptible Power Supply for the Base Unit
2. How to extend the battery life by several factors (Green Tips, Saving Energy)
3. My short review

============================
UNINTERRUPTIBLE POWER SUPPLY
============================

I was surprised, and delighted, to discover that this system will still work during a power outage of up to 90 minutes, possibly up to 120 minutes. Here's how it works.

1. Always keep one of the handsets in the charging cradle on the main unit. This will keep that handset at 100%.

2. In the event of a power failure, the base unit steals power from the battery in the handset to keep functioning.

3. To maximize the length of time that this unit will function during a power failure, do NOT use the handset that is in the base unit, or use the base unit itself, to make or receive calls during a power failure. Instead, use one of your other charged phones.

==========================
GREEN TIPS - ENERGY-SAVING
==========================

1. When you get your package, go ahead and plug in all the chargers and charge all your handsets.

2. Once they are all fully charged, take the handsets out of the small chargers, then unplug all the small chargers and put them back in the box for storage.

3. Put the handsets where they will be most useful to you. (I put my base unit on my office desk, the other handsets in the living room, kitchen, bathroom, and by my bed.)

ROTATE YOUR HANDSETS DAILY OR ?????

My guess is that your phone usage pattern will allow you to come up with a rotation plan, so you can just charge one phone at a time, whether it be one phone each night, or one phone every two nights, or ????

I use one phone the most, and the others remain at three bars (out of three) for days in a row, so I came up with this system to save money and extend the life of my batteries. (Or should I say ""extend the lives of my batteries""?)

1. Number the handsets, #1 to #5 (or however many you got)

2. Keep one handset in the base unit at all times, this is your battery backup. Let's call the first handset you put in the base unit #1.

3. If you're like me, you'll use one handset more than any other. Let's call that #2.

4. Use handset #2 for most of your calls, but every evening, look at the number of bars visible on that phone. When the display has dropped from three bars to one bar, take phone #1 out of the base unit. Put #2 in the base unit, and start using phone #3 for most of your calls, putting handset #1 where #3 used to be.

5. Once handset #3 gets down to one bar, rotate #2 out of the base, #3 into the base, and #4 into the most frequent handset position.

I bet you get the general idea.

Next would be #4 into the base, #5 most used
Next #5 in the base, #1 most used
and finally back to where we started
#1 in the base, #2 most used

This could be like rotating tires on a car????

This strategy saves you power (you only plug in the base unit) and should extend the battery life of all the batteries, since you're not keeping them constantly near 100% as you'd be tempted to do if you charged every phone every night. It's actually better for the batteries if you let them run down almost to nothing before you charge them. (In fact, after the first cycle through all the handsets, you can let the battery run down to zero bars, then switch when you notice it's at zero or when the handset tells you the battery is almost dead.

Feel free to adapt this method to your phone usage patterns.

ONE SMALL CAVEAT (buyer beware)

Though you can connect two smartphones plus a landline to this unit, only one smartphone can be in use on any of the phone handsets at one time. If you are talking on your first smartphone on a handset, and the second smartphone rings, you'll have to either: 1) answer it on the second smartphone, or 2) hang up on the first phone call before you can answer it on any handset).

This is not a problem for me, but if you are tempted to put YOUR smartphone and your kid's smartphone on this unit, I'd think twice, because if your kids make and receive lots of phone calls, they could prevent you from using the handsets when you need them. Instead, put your smartphone on this system, and let them use their smartphone only.

WHAT AM I REVIEWING?

You can hook up your wired phone line plus up to two smart phones, but I am only reviewing this product on the basis of ONE smartphone, and zero land lines.

CONCLUSION

I am delighted with this phone system. Originally I was looking for something that would let me use old dial or rotary phones on house wiring to answer smartphone calls, but this makes much more sense.

I highly recommend this phone system. With it, I don't need land lines, since I can use this phone during a short blackout, and for longer blackouts, I could plug it in to the computer's UPS.",4,9.0478

Brought every pencil to a perfect point, and only took one try every time. Note: that does have to do with the pencil quality, also. If the lead inside the pencil breaks, it won't matter what sharpener you use, it will constantly break and fall out (depending, of course, on how broken the lead is inside).

Doing the initial sharpening, the canister had to be emptied about every 7 to 9 pencils. It's not a big deal, though, really, and subsequent maintenance sharpening would not fill it for quite some time.

""The cutting sticks are made of the best self-healing materials. A new cutting stick can be rotated 4 times, flipped and rotated 4 more times. Each time, it can last for about 250-300 cuts. When the bottom sheets do not have clean cuts, it's time to rotate the cutting stick.

The nib is very smooth and puts down a nice line of ink. It is not too dry and not too wet. There is a reason I own three of these pens now. They are great.
This pen runs on the large side. Check the specs on length if you have really small hands as this pen might feel bulky to some. I have medium size (men's) hands and the size is ok for me but on the big side.
The pen is super tail-heavy when posted so I only write with it unposted. The cap doesn't post very tight anyway and it might fall off if you tried.
Another thing I love is the way the ink sloshes around inside the pen. There are videos and even special in bottles to help you fill the pen to 100% capacity But I like the way mine looks with the ink sloshing around in it. Fully loaded almost every ink just looks black but when it is sloshing around with air you can see the colors in the thin spots. I dig that.

One unit plugs into the router and into an electric socket.  The other unit I plugged into my printer and into a wall socket (one issue is you have to plug directly into the socket to get a good connection so no surge protectors). However, once the printer was connected to my office network I could see it from every computer on the network and install the software on all of the computers.

First, the printer. It weighs a ton.  Luckily it came very well packed-- not even the UPS guy dropping it so hard it made the floor shake caused any problems.  It was also easily assembled and the software installed without problems.  The printing is crisp and clean looking.  Although just black and white, that was exactly what I wanted.  I was very happy with speed and print quality.

The only thing that I thought was less than great was the multifunction software.  I was pleased to see that this software would allow the printer to be a central FAX.  I'm totally spoiled by the ability to FAX from any desktop in the office.  Saves on paper and time.  Except I spent hours trying to get the FAX function to work.  I've been spoiled by the Epson software.  The Samsung software lacks some of the features I find very useful on the Epson  so I've keep the Epson as the central FAX even though it eats up expensive ink jet toner when printing out FAX acknowledgement pages.  Also the Epson will save incoming FAXs to my hard drive so I can print out only what I want.  Although I have had the Samsung for a month I haven't got this function to work on it.

I also use these markers to color in coloring books for adults (images with very small pieces to color, as well as some larger areas).  They are phenomenal at controlling where the ink goes when working in tight spaces, and I love the ""brush"" feel of the large end, which allows you to color at an angle, where you can cover maximum page space as you brush the color of the marker over a large surface.  Yet, if you need a medium-point tip, you can use the end of the brush marker, and you get that, too.

In comparing various dual-tipped markers made by various companies, I found these to be just as good as some of the much more pricey markers.

For reviewer's comments on the ""P"" version of the ink, Some (not all) canon printers use BOTH the Cyan, Magenta and Photo Cyan and Photo Magenta ink cartridges. If your printer only uses 4 ink cartridges you probably should NOT be using PC or PM. If you have a printer with 6 ink cartridges then PC and PM are two additional required ones.  Whats the difference? The PC and PM are a different shade of Cyan and Magenta which allows the more expensive 6 color printers to be a bit more granular in the shades of color they can produce in your photos so they can be a little more accurate compared to the four color printers.",8,8.238986
3445,"Over any consumable commodity, two major questions reign:

* Is the OEM product significantly better than its clones to merit its higher price?

* Is this price the lowest?

Having used inkjets and laser printers since their inceptions, plus having worked in high tech sales and service, I can write without hesitation that the consumables produced by the original equipment manufacturer are ALWAYS as good or better than any clones. That they are often significantly better more often than not makes up for the slight cost differential once extreme discounting kicks in.

In short, a highly discounted OEM consumable is almost always a better buy than a clone. The failure rate is lower and the consistency higher.

As for price, why pay any more than you must? This inkjet cartridge is the same OEM product whether you get it from Amazon, Office Max, Staples, or anywhere else.

Fact is, Amazon is always competitive. And if you can't get it as cheaply from Amazon directly, it's likely one of Amazon's third party storefronts will have it for a tiny bit less.

Buy the OEM. Buy it from Amazon. Save the time and hassle. Ultimately, you're saving money too.",2,10.783365

Reversed type slightly blurry, not crisp and clear like on a good inkjet printer.

Sometimes, when I need to print something, I need to keep hitting buttons until I get the right combination to print, even though I'm printing on 8.5 by 11 paper, or on envelopes. There are only four control buttons, but they are not intuitive. Sometimes, but not all the time, it keeps asking me to confirm what I am printing on. An eight page Word document sometimes requires me to press OK eight times. Sometimes in an eight page document it prints the first page a few times. It keeps asking whether or not to print stored jobs, and insert the thumb drive in the USB port. Maybe I just have a defective printer, but if they are all like this it is not very well-thought out.

I read a lot of other reviews and compared costs to make decision to purchase this particular set. I couldn't be happier either!!

This set of gel pens is fantastic. The diamond tip means that each pen has a very fine tip (0.8mm) which is perfect for coloring in small areas or for daily writing. The pigment of the ink if vibrant in all colors and below are the colors that are included in the set:

12 Metallic - Bronze, Gold, Silver, , Black, Dark Green, Dark Blue, Magenta, Purple, Light Green, Pink, Yellow, Light Blue
12 Pastel - Pink, Purple, Rose, Yellow, Turquoise, Orange, Blue, Lavender, Melon, Green, Brown, Yellow/Green
12 Neon - Magenta, Green, orange, Pink, Light Green, Orange, Violet, Yellow, Red, Purple, Dark Blue, Electric Blue
12 Glitter - Gold, Green, Brown, Dark Blue, Pink, Purple, Light Blue, Silver, Black, Orange, Red, Yellow

As I stated in my video, the only negative aspect that I found about this set of pens is that the ink does not dry quickly. I have smeared ink all over my coloring and my hand. You just need to be aware of where the ink is still damp whether you're coloring or writing.

In addition to having very fine tips and a nice array of colors, these pens also come with a great case. The case latches on three sides and securely hold the pens in place so that when you're working, you can place the case horizontally or vertically. I love it. I wish more manufacturers would do this with their pens, pencils, markers, etc.

Overall, I am happy with my purchase. If you are shopping for diamond tip gel pens, I don't think you'll be disappointed that you purchased these. I know I am not.",2,14.509999

3455,"It's a nice little unit, but not all that great. It does, however do a better job than most regular printers. By far, to my experience (current owner of 3 HP printers) HP mfg some of the best, if not THE BEST printers.
Now, back to the photosmart 145...the major plus is the ease of use (extremely easy) the ergonomics are well laid out and as a 1st timer on photo printers, I didn't have to read the manual. The photosmart 145 will not earn 5 stars due to the limited features/functions that was incorporated...like: only 4X6 photo size and no option for wallet size prints; can't do ""portrait"" prints to my option but only landscape, maybe can do on computer with bundled software and having to ""rotate"" pictures to coincide. Prints resulted in ""cropped"" pictures leaving the edges cutoff or ""deleted"" by 1/4"" on top and bottom (border or borderless). You do have more options when operating prints from a computer and you can select many various features like print quality, tweaking colors and so forth. The print qualities are acceptable, even at ""Best"" mode, I can still comb through some tiny, tiny pixelated dithering effects on prints with the naked eye. I've printed better quality pictures from my other non-photo HP printer. Also, it is not wise to stick a media card full of pictures into the unit itself for direct printing unless you want to take wild guesses for what to print and not to print of certain pictures. The monochrome lcd screen tells you how many pictures and I.D. them by numbers only, so if you want to print ONLY that picture of your cute little niece in the middle of the pile somewhere, well, good luck...unless you have an Intel chip-equipt brain or alot of $$ to waste on photo papers. Overall, this is a nice little unit. I would only use for quick prints to distribute photos of my cars to my insurance companies, share photos with friends/colleagues and for municipal purposes. For the photo albums, I will either take my shots to Rite-Aid for quality prints or maybe invest some $$ for a more advance printer in the near future - perhaps the 245 or 325...but wait, what am I complaining about? I got the photosmart 145 for FREE when I purchased my Leica D-LUX digital camera. Leica UPS'd it to me 3 weeks later...I guess I have nothing to lose but to share the experience with you before you fork out the $$.

3456,"I decided to do some research before ordering these Rubber Bands.  In the past I just went to the local office supply store and bought what I needed.  Unforunantly it seems that there is a big difference in rubber bands and what keeps them strong.  So after reading a lot of reviews on the web and decided I need to find ones that were made from Natural Crepe.  Mostly I use them for holding my power cords and charging cables together along with holding small boxes that I have parts in for my Drones.  And in the past most of the ones I had bought would break a short time after or the second time I would try to reuse them.  So when I received the Alliance rubber bands I put them through some stretching much greater than what I would normally do along with seeing how hard it was to break them.  I was Very Happy with each test and so I wanted to share this with anyone that was looking for a strong,  easy to stretch rubber band.  I am extremely happy I did this research.

3458,"This supercheap Pilot Pen is am amazing deal (and also comes in clear, but for some reason the nib on the black one is better).

Its EF nib makes it an American EEF, which is nearly a hairline but not scratchy. It stays nice and wet due to the tiny cap with little air in it to dry out the nib. The red ""ears"" on the sides of the cap keep the pen from rolling, and they are also just plain cute. The cap also posts very well.  Additionally, I like its slim little waist and the indentions which show where to put your fingers. The way the caps attaches when the pen is closed makes a sleek long black piece that I find somehow very aesthetic.

I have bought this pen many times for various people, and they all loved it.  I do suggest a wetter, deeper-colored ink for this.  My choice would be Private Reserve Midnight Blues, a free-flowing heavily-pigmented navy blue.  As long as you prefer a very fine line, you cannot go wrong with this pen.",56,6.3606796
3459,"The Canon Pixma MX420 is a solid all in one inkjet printer that will satisfy most home users but does not excel in any given area. This is not surprising considering the low price. It does all the basics, such as printing text/color photos/graphics, fax, and copying. The duplex printing capability (ability to print on both sides of a paper) is nice also. It also has built in Wifi capability, which allows you to print wirelessly from anywhere in the home. The 802.11N Wifi capability is a nice speed upgrade compared to my older Brother MFC 7840W printer, which only has 802.11g, but in most cases I don't think you'll notice the difference in terms of how quickly a page gets printed out.

Print quality is good overall, with very readable text and pictures. If you are interested in the best text quality, you may want to consider a laser printer instead. Similarly, if printing photos is your primary goal, you would be better off with a photo-centric model such as any of the Epson inkjet printers. If versatility is most important, this model should be fine for you. Keep in mind that for about $40-50 more, you can get a more capable Canon printer such as the MX882. The MX882 may also save you some ink money in the long term since it uses 5 separate ink cartridges vs 2 for the MX420. This means that if you happen to run out of magenta in the MX420, you have to replace the whole color cartridge even if you have plenty of the other colors left, whereas with the MX882 you can just replace the magenta cartridge. Some folks may actually prefer the simplicity of stocking just 2 cartridges, though, so you should probably purchase based on what is more important to you.",29,11.2667

3463,"I could not resist the price on a Canon printer compared to other similar brands, knowing the name is well respected. I have always owned HP products (which were generally more expensive, but very long-lived) and decided to try one. The first model that I purchased lasted only about 8 months, before it had so many bugs that we replaced it. We needed another printer and decided to give Canon one more try.

First, it does require a download and/or use of a CD for  installation and this was not as simple as it could have been, but doable. If you are going to link it up, you will need to purchase a cable (not included). So far the print quality is good and it  functions just as well as more expensive brands, with one caveat. It goes through ink quite quickly. The idea that having multiple color cartridges saves you money is simply not the case. You may only have to replace a yellow, or magenta, etc. but the small individual cartridges are not inexpensive. I've found that I have spent more money on the replacements than I did with combined color cartridges for my HP printer. Although, I have also found that the warning sign for ink replacement is very premature and you can print at least 50-100 more pages before the color is actually out.

Like most similarly priced printers, the paper tray is somewhat limited in capacity, which is a bit of a pain. I would like to be able to load a ream or close to it, and forget about it, but they are simply not large enough to accomate that much paper. I do have to admit I have had less jams with the more limited trays, so perhaps that is a good point.

Overall, I would consider this an average printer for limited use. If you are going to be using your printer for a business or with great frequency, the ink replacement cost will be a negative. I haven't had this model long enough to see what the longevity is compared with my other Canon model, but I am hopeful that this one will have a longer lifespan since we are now using two printers in the household and this one does not take on the biggest jobs.

I will admit that my HP Officejet Pro 8600 is still my favorite, as it was easier to set up and has an overall sturdier quality to it, is quieter and easier & cheaper to maintain. However, the Pixma is smaller and less obtrusive, and certainly less expensive by about $100 dollars. If you are after a bargain, this might be it, but consider the ink cost as well.

 Functionally, it's a good choice, plus it has the scanner/copier which can come in handy. Too bad it doesn't go a step further and include a simple Fax.",58,13.565094

3465,"Gorgeousness!  Yes, I love this mechanical pencil as it fulfills my need for aesthetics as well as utility.
Why?  PROS:
The design is sleek. It tapers down on both sides reaching a fine point on the lead side. As can be seen from the picture, the point is long and thin allowing for use of this pen from multiple angles. Here's how: Since I am using the pencil to write text on regular paper, I am not always hunched over to see precisely where the lead touches the paper like I would if I was drawing. Yet, I still get a good view of where I am writing because of the thin and long point as opposed as other mech. pencils that retain the girth of the pencil all the way down and then have a tiny metal point extruding at the tip to hold the lead.

Another plus for this mechanical pencil is its retro-styling. It is plastic, but the pencil itself, as well as the lettering (font) on the pencil give it an air of an established design. There are ridges in the plastic near the tip to create a firm grip when writing.

Minor CONS: There is no eraser, as tiny as erasers are for some mech. pencils, they still serve a purpose at times. There is space to add one here, but it is not present.  On the positive side, the black cap at the end holds a sharp metal filament to remove the lead path should lead get stuck in there.

The other con would be that the screwable tip that stores the lead in place should match the metal of the tip and the clip, but it doesn't as it is made of aluminum as opposed to steel.  Again, it does not affect the mechanics at all which thus far, have been flawless:  I have had not lead breakage.

I hope this helps. If you like what you see, you can be sure that it is what you get, plus a really handy tool that does not break leads.

3466,"I bought this because I needed better scans of color prints than I could get from my office multifunction printer/scanner, and this certainly meets that need. I compared scans from my printer scanner with scans of the same print from the Canoscan, and the results are far better -- more accurate colors, better correction of defects, and faster.

In addition to the scanner, I bought VueScan software, which provides a great deal of capability and flexibility and which recognized the Canoscan immediately. I installed VueScan rather than the Canon software that's included with the scanner, so I can't comment on the Canon software.  You may want to buy the Kindle version of The VueSCan Bible, which gives very useful information about film and print scanning in general and explains the considerable capabilities of VueSCan' software.  (FWIW, the book makes favorable references to this scanner).

A dedicated film scanner would be a better choice for film, but the Canoscan will handle slides and even color negatives.  It's useful to make a ""color profile"" if you're going to scan slides or prints so that you get correct color.  To do that you need to buy IT8 targets.

3472,"I spend a lot of time on the computer, and since I have a laptop I decided to purchase a stand for it because I noticed that my neck would start hurting after looking down at the screen for a while (it also doesn't help that I read a lot and so I spend quite a bit of time with my head craned downards).  Anyways, this stand is incredibly versatile.  I can use it on top of my desk to elevate my laptop so I'm not looking down, or I can use it in bed.  I like the fact that it also helps to vent heat.  I think the metal tray is made of aluminum, and it has lots of little holes in it to help disperse heat.  This means that the fans in my laptop don't have to work as hard, keeping my room a lot quieter.  The only drawback to the little holes is that it means the tray does not function well as a writing desk (I suppose you could always use a clipboard).  I love that there are so many different ways to adjust the height and angle of this stand.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that the buttons you have to use to adjust the height and angles can be kind of difficult to push and can stick a little bit, so sometimes it's a little difficult to adjust.",6,4.960624

3474,"Shredders are one of those items where it doesn't make sense to go cheap. All you buy with cheap shredders is trouble - they are not worth the price or the space they take up.  The Fellowes Powershred 76CT shredder addresses a number of the issues you face with less capable shredders:

SHREDDING:  Less expensive shredders won't shred much.  Even if you stick to the very limited number of pages, they often jam.  And, less expensive shredders don't shred for very long.  While the Fellowes 76CT still has a limited time before you have to allow the shredder to cool, it's much longer than low-priced shredders and allows for a meaningful amount of shredding.  This model offers cross-cut shredding for greater security.

NOISE: I'm still testing the noise.  It seems a bit more modest for the amount shredded, but hardly quiet.  You won't be talking on the phone while you're shredding.

CATCHING THE WASTE:  The Fellowes Powershred 76CT has 6.5 gallon removable bin you remove to remove the shredded material.  That's far better than the less expensive models, which require you to lift the heavy, awkward shredding head to empty to shredder.  Sometimes a pile of shred builds up in the bin, requiring you to rearrange the material inside the bin while shredding to allow it to fill, but I don't mind.

WARRANTY:  Fellowes includes a 1 year product warranty and a 5 year cutter warranty.  Read the comments on other similar Fellowes shredders (such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Powershred-99Ci/dp/B000YGO7HW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Powershred 99Ci</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Powershred-79Ci/dp/B000WB397I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Powershred 79Ci</a>&nbsp;to get a sense of the experience of other users.

WHY ARE DECENT SHREDDERS SO EXPENSIVE?  My only real issue with the shredder at this point is the price.  It's not clear to me why this type of product should cost as much as it does (currently at the list price of $220), in terms of manufacturing cost.  It could be that there is a high support cost to cover as well.  Or, it could be they are pricing this for the small office market, where the cost is deductible (which makes the after-tax cost lower).  Currently, more powerful, larger models of Fellowes shredders (such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fellowes-Powershred-99Ci-Shredder/dp/B000YGO7HW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fellowes Powershred 99Ci Shredder</a>) cost somewhat less - so compare prices.

CONSIDER YOUR RESPONSIBILITY:  Shredders have become more important, due to increasing regulation and awareness of security risks (even as the use of electronic documents expands).  Shredders are essential if you deal with social security numbers, health information, or other critical personal information - whether yours or your employees' or clients' information.  So give some thought to your legal and ethical responsibilities if you handle that type of information.

In summary, if you need a machine that will actually shred effectively, something like the Fellowes Powershred 76CT is a very good option.  Many less capable shredders are difficult to use and aren't good for much more than shredding the occasional bill, or slowly working through a small stack of papers.",3,12.862408

One nice thing with the software package and keyboard you can take notes in a lecture class and download the notes to a word processor program to print them out (with a bit of skill you can even hook Dragon program up to it so you don't even need to type.) Just one of the many things this calculator can do. If you can call it a calculator. As far as math go's it will work basic math up to the levels of nuclear physics, the many fields of Engineering and mathematics. This calculator will just about do it all. How ever you will have to learn how to do a lot of it by your self as support as in a user manual from TI is lacking. They is a lot of support sites online, many pre written programs available that are good and do work nicely with good documentation. So not all hope is lost in that area. So don't let that scare you away from buying this calculator. It's a work horse just waiting to get out of the starting gate. I highly recommend it!

3505,"I needed a compact inexpensive dual printer stand. Wide enough to hold most printers, but not too big or too small in itself. This stand is made of hard plastic, not rubberize, not soft plastic, so it gives a very firm surface. Legs and shelves just snapped together easily. I did not even need to look at the included assemble guide.
NOTE: This stand can be assembled differently than pictured.
Because I have two printers that I wanted this stand for, I needed a lower spaced ""second"" shelf lower than what is pictured.
Well... you CAN assemble this cart so that the second shelf is at the bottom section. Pretty much reverse of what is pictured.
YES, you can assemble this stand to meet your spacing needs.
I have the top shelf as pictured, then next down about 17"" below that is the second shelf (for my printer # two). And the smallest spaced shelf at the very bottom.
The vertical area between the smaller spaced shelves is about 6.5"" tall. And 17"" vertical area between the taller spaced shelves. So I basically assembled this reverse order than pictured. And because all parts are just snap-in, this reverse assemble method was easy to do.
Just simply assemble parts so the smaller spaced area between shelves is at the bottom, not the top.
This makes for an ideal dual printer cart.
Stand comes with wheels that snap into the bottom legs. This is near as sturdy as a wooden printer stand. And the price was right.
You can also leave the wheels off if you want, or if you do not need to roll the cart around.
Versatile stand for many uses, but almost perfect for people needing two printers on one stand. The available sitting area of the very top shelf is 17.5"" deep, and 19"" wide. The available sitting area for the 2 shelves under the top shelf, taking in to account the area used up by the legs, the available sitting area is 17.5"" deep, and 16"" wide. So if you want to place a printer on the lower shelve, the printer size should be no more than 17.5"" deep, and 16"" wide for that lower shelf printer. I put my brother laser printer on the second shelf, and the all-in-one printer on the very top shelf (for access to the scanner). Works like a charm!

3513,"The results from 35mm color slides are very good, but I wouldn't call them great. There's a little loss of sharpness and resolution, and some sketchy contrast issues (a little too much whiteness it seems at times), but some of that can be recovered with a sharpening filter and contrast adjustment in photo editing software, and controlled somewhat by adjustments to the scanner. So for most of us, it's just fine.

For the price, though, and when you consider the alternative is a very expensive high resolution film scanner, the results are great!

What it appears to be is not actually a scanner, but a little self-contained digital camera with a built-in light source. The slide-in holders work well, and after I learned the buttons and digitized a few slides and negatives, I got quite efficient at it. I digitized a box of around 200 old slides in what seemed like no time. Results were great with negatives too, including 110 pocket camera size.

3521,"I had trouble, initially, installing the driver.

I tried installing, then doing a repair install... nothing.

Each time I would reboot when they told me to, and then plug in the scanner, and it would come up with USB2.0 Scanner install software.

I would pick No on the first choice, then 'Install Automatically' and it wouldn't find the driver. I would try the DVD drive, and it wouldn't find it on that either. I tried pointing to the C:\Program Files\ScanExpress folder... still couldn't find it.

After becoming very frustrated I went to their website and downloaded another driver. It just said Web.exe. Installed it, rebooted, same problem.

Tried doing a repair, again, running the installer from the CD. Then it said it couldn't find the .msi file (even though the .msi file was in the right Temp folder).

Decided to do a System Restore back to yesterday and rebooted.

This time I even unplugged the scanner (as well as unplugging the USB cable). That should have nothing to do with it; but did it anyways.

Oh, also, they said if it didn't auto run to put in E:\run where E: is the drive of the CD. That can't work because there is no run.exe on the CD.

You have to go to My Computer, double-click on the one the drive called Autorun and double-click on the file called AutoRun.exe  (If you don't have extensions turned on so you can see the three-letter extension it will be one of the two round blue icons).

Installed again, and this time waited just a LITTLE LONGER before rebooting when it asked if I wanted to reboot. I have a program called 'Scotty' which allows or disallows startup programs from being invisibly added to the startup script of the computer. It asked if I wanted to do a RunOnce on this file and I said YES. There was the error. It installs a Run script that had to be OKed by my Scotty Startup program. That Run script must load the driver.

The next time I rebooted... then plugged in the scanner, it saw it as a ScannerUSb2.0, then it saw it as the full name and said it mounted the driver properly.

So, if you have trouble installing the software, wait 5 minutes before rebooting to make sure none of your watchdog programs are going to ask if it's OK to run that startup script.

...

After I properly installed the driver the annoying Panel keeps popping up even though I'm wishing to use Photoshop's plug-in from Phtoshop's File->Import menu. That was annoying, and don't see where you turn off that auto-popup panel. It's easy to just close it... but it annoys.

...

The first time I scanned the cover a book it came in with horrible multi-colored herringbone patterns (which I knew was because the scan rate of the scanner was near to the dot rate of the halftone dots on the book.

I increased the dots-per-inch to 300 from the 200. Didn't take much longerer to scan; but the results were better. There were only some horizontal rainbow lines after using 300.

Next, I tried 400 dpi as the Resolution. Still, it was a pretty fast scan. Color banding was still about the same.

Finally, scanned at 1200 and it took a very long time. There was no trace of herringbone afterwards. Used Photoshop's Gausian Blur to mush the halftone dots together, then reduced to 300 dpi, then used the Unsharp Mask to focus the image again and voila... incredible image, no banding, no halftone dots.

---

However, a second book cover that I scanned did fine with the 200 setting and no herringbones. (High-quality books use a higher number of halftone dots per inch on their covers).

Moral of the story? Set your scan to 300, rather than the default 200 and your scans will be higher-quality with little slow-down. Herringbones will be mostly not there unless you scan very high-quality documents with tight halftone dots.

If you get herringbone patterns; scan at 1200, add blur, reduce to 200, add sharpening.

---

I was also hoping I was going to be able to set 3D objects on the glass and scan them. No way. It will be completely out-of-focus, worse even than when I use my Epson $30 scanner. Years ago I had a scanner which focused so deeply that it made this possible. In this case, it has such a bad depth of field that you better definitely press down on any picture which is curved or it will be out-of-focus. Good connection with the glass is essential with this scanner as it has absoluteely no depth-of-field capability.

All-in-all, after I got the driver loading properly, the only annoyance I have is that stupid pop-up panel. If it pops up when you're using Photoshop, just close it and it will go away for awhile.

Scan quality... excellent (particuarly at 1200 dpi of course). Contrast is also excellent. Color balance is excellent. They don't mention anything about Color Match software (matching the input of the scanner to the output of the screen); but there's a checkmark in the panel settings, at least, for Color Match and the default is checked.

In Photoshop's Twain Driver there's also a checkmark for Color Match, which is checkmarked.",4,8.523697
3522,"I am 30 years into using ""white"" boards and this one tops them all.  The glass and frosting is what I would call ""light banker green"" like the old school color of paper ledgers.  My board hangs over a light grayish blue wall and a oak chair rail it looks great.  I agree with all of the positive comments. For installing:
Clean the back of the board!
1.  Use one of the loose cardboard sheet to make a template.  The glass is not fragile it can bounce and flex with no issues.  Lay the cardboard flat on the floor and tilt the board onto it.  Use one person on each side but tilt (leave one edge on the floor) it down until it rests on the cardboard.
2. Take the metal stand off brackets and unscrew them, place them through the glass onto the cardboard (this opposite of how they will go on the wall), put the screws through the standoff (which passes through the glass) into the cardboard being careful to put them straight through.  this leaves a mark for the center of the hole.  Also mark the inside diameter of the whole with a fine tip marker just in case you don't get the screws centered just right.
3. Now cut the cardboard away from the perimeter of the glass using a sharp knife.  The screws will keep the glass and cardboard from sliding apart.  Keep the knife tight against the edge of the glass and use several shallow cuts instead of one deep one.
4. Reverse the above.  You will now have an exact template with targets for the wall anchors.
5.  Hang the template. I used painters tape to fix the template to the wall and them used a small drill bit to make holes in the drywall through he cardboard template.
6. Insert wall anchors.  I upgraded to a metal screw in type (no drill).
7. Fasten standoffs leaving the screws a few turns loose (good advice found above)
8.  Place board over standoffs and support it until you finish tightening the stand off screws
9.  screw in caps to stand offs.

The standoffs have some slop.  By leaving the wall anchor screws a little loose you will have even more play.  Plus the glass is surprising flexible and resilient.  So even though the fit is precise the above steps make it much easier.

Took me and one person 30 minutes after unboxing and cleaning.",3,12.398071

3529,"In case anyone is considering alternatives for integrating their landline with their cellphone service, caveat emptor. I live in an area with poor cell phone coverage. Additionally, I am of an age where cell phones do not feel as comfortable as landlines do. Because of these and other considerations, I have been paying attention to the growing availability of 3rd party adapters allowing supposed integration of cellphone and landlines as well as the growing number of landlines that are labelled bluetooth. These are almost universally used to describe some degree of integration with cell phones. Ideally, I would be able to use my land line to answer my cell phone and my cell phone would be able to use my hardwired phones better reception.

I have purchased Panasonic phones exclusively over the past decade and am beginning to wonder how I managed to fall sway to their hype. They are generally one of the more expensive brands yet the quality of the phones aspires to mediocrity . I purchased a home 2-line phone with 4 additional handsets. Two of the handsets arrived dead. Panasonic made the return process so difficult I still have 2 dead handsets.

Displaying a remarkable inability to not learn from previous mistakes, I purchased this TG-9381 Panasonic after looking at a number of ""Bluetooth"" phones. It took a few hours of rereading the manual and finally calling Panasonic to realize that they had slapped the Bluetooth label on this phone in a way that is almost fraudulent. The Bluetooth capability on this phone only refers to the ability to take phone numbers programmed into your cell phone and transfer them to this Panasonic phone. There is no capability for integrating  cell phone service into the unit.

Panasonic, along with most vendors of Panasonic phones, still show this model under searches for ""Bluetooth integration with cell phone service"". Thus far, it is the only landline I have seen that uses this terminology to mean anything other than full integration with cell phones.

The only beneficial service this phone actually performed was to wake me from my kneejerk requirement to buy phones made by Panasonic. Once I started looking for this type of product made by other manufacturers, I saw that there were many less expensive phones with much better ratings.",6,10.356019

STILL WORKS PERFECTLY, EVEN CONNECTS VIA WIFI TO NEW CELL, TABLET ETC...

Always buy refurbished ink - very affordable
(I am not a heavy user, but always reliable)

NEW UPDATE - BACK TO A 5 STAR PRODUCT (AUGUST, 2010) - I don't even remember the problem I mentioned.  I did get a Wireless N Router (on sale) and for the first time used this printer's Wireless Options.  Since going wireless, it has functioned MUCH MUCH BETTER and without a single problem ... Using the Wireless connection.

Having gone ""Wireless Printing"" - I would not (and could not) ever go back to a USB attached Printer.  GO FOR THE WIRELESS IF YOU CAN.  IT'S MUCH BETTER - FOR MANY REASONS (THE CONNECTION, SPEED, REDUCED JAMS/PROBLEMS, NO CORD, FASTER CPU USE/PROCESSING AND PRINTING TIME AND MUCH QUIETER .... ONLY BECAUSE I CAN PUT THE PRINTER FAR FROM ME AND MY LAPTOP ... SO I DON'T HEAR A THING NOW WHEN I PRINT.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UPDATE: JUST AFTER WRITING MY REVIEW - MARCH 23, 2010 PRINTER STOPPED WORKING AND THE HP DRIVER IS IN A PERMANENT RE-INSTALL MODE WHEN I TRY TO USE THE PRINTER.

SO MUCH FOR MY GIVING SUCH A GOOD REVIEW.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have a HP Laptop (despite a lot of negative HP reviews I have seen around, I've never had a problem) and figure I ought to buy HP components/accessories whenever possible to make sure it will install as easily as possible.

This one was an instant install (well, it took a lot of HP downloading and installing of software, automatically, but a lot) and works great.

BIGGEST CON:  The PRICE of the replacement cartridges.  I bought this printer because at the time my existing printer was out of ink and a new set of in cartridges was literally more expensive than this brand new printer (black friday kind of sale).

CON: The environmental cost of the PRINTER PRICING AND MARKETING.  Printers go on sale a super cheap prices to get you 'hooked' on the manufacturers brand AND THEN THEIR INK.

Note: I thought my next printer would be the Kodak All In one .... ONLY BECAUSE OF THE CHEAPER INK PRICES ... I am not sure of this, but I have been told that Kodak is cheaper ink, BUT Kodak requires SPECIAL KODAK PAPER which is much more expensive ... totally negating the ink price savings.  (not confirmed)

PRO: CHECK ON AMAZON FOR IN REPLACEMENT/REFILLS.  I HAVE FOUND ONE SELLER WHO I HAVE USED TWICE WITH EXCELLENT RESULTS .... AND CAN GET REPLACEMENT CARTRIDGES FOR ONLY $8.  They are 'remanufactured' or something like that, but work GREAT!  The best price for HP NEW replacement ink cartridges (number 96) is extremely HIGH and should be considered before buying this printer.

Otherwise, I am a light, infrequent printer user, but have had wonderful and easy results from this printer for over a year or two.  LOOK FOR A GOOD SALE PRICE! :)",6,7.3688874

The carabiner on top combined with the clip on the back makes it easy to attach to the various lanyards I have, or I can put it on a belt look or a shirt pocket.  The line itself is a little thicker than I was used to, so either my job cheaped out on their holders or this is more sturdy than regular holders.

3565,"If you are new to fountain pens, This is a truly ideal starter pen. In the hand, it really feels like a medium(not high)-end pen, but it's outrageously affordable for a fountain pen. It feels very solid and CLICKS audibly when the cap it put on and taken off. It's METAL! What other pen at this price point is metal?

I wanted an affordable fountain pen so fine that it would scratch the paper when writing with it, and not surprisingly, Pilot made that possible with the fine nib; don't get scared, this only happens when written with the nib upside-down; when upside-down, it can deliver a needle-thin line, and it will rip the paper I just love ultra-fine lines.

As for writing with the nib right-side up, the nib glides quite smoothly over any paper I gave it. I don't intend to malign it, but I was very disappointed that the Lamy Safari(my first fountain pen, regretfully) was much more expensive yet wrote nowhere as gloriously as the Pilot Metropolitan did. The Safari offers quite a bit of unneeded feedback, whereas the Metropolitan effortlessly glides with nearly no resistance.

The ONLY drawback, which can be easily resolved, is the included aerometric converter; a piston converter would have been much better suited for a pen this nice.
As stated, this is no issue at all and is effortlessly resolved by simply using an ink syringe or super thin pipette to refill the included ink cartridge with any choice of fine ink.
My only note on the ink that comes in the cartridge, it smells like burning plastic almost, quite unsettling, and it pales in comparison to my Aurora Black ink (no pun intended).

Since I can remember, I have always been obsessed with Pilot Gel pens.
The Pilot Metropolitan has introduced me to the next level of Fine Writing Instruments, and I cannot wait to improve my writing so I can upgrade to my dream pen the Pilot Falcon with an Extra Fine nib.

Thank you Pilot for an unbelievably affordable yet outstanding writing instrument!",3,12.123167

It came packaged with six black ink cartridges and a converter (which is supposed to contain a miniscule opaque plastic ball, mine did not..when you use up one of the cartridges, it has a plastic ball in it that can be cut out, and used in the converter..am NOT dinging them for that, it happens)

The 8mm nib is German made, not too wide, not too thin....just about perfect....it writes wonderfully and balances like a pen costing much more.

The surface is very smooth, almost a cherry wood finish. On the bottom are two Velcro-attached ""rolls"" that are filled with tiny pellets, like you'd find in a beanbag. These pellets will conform to your legs, making the lapdesk very comfortable. It also has two diagonal elastic straps in the top corners, where you can stash papers so they won't slide off.

One of the benefits of the lapdesk is that it raises your laptop, so you're typing in a more natural position, which is easier on your wrists. Unfortunately, one of the downsides is that it raises your laptop, which puts strain on your shoulders. Now, it could just be because I have a history of tendonitis, but when I use the lapdesk for any length of time, my right shoulder muscles freeze up.

Wrong, the chalk is actually quite ""rocky"". The first words I wrote on my chalkboard ended up being permanent, because the chalk actually *scratches* the board. Fortunately, having written over that area many times, and erased it many times, the scratches are difficult to notice.

3611,"I am well experienced in shredders. No I haven't worked for a lawyer or politician but just needed to shred for my businesses and home paperwork.

In fact this isn't my first shredder review. :) But I need to clear up a few shredder misconceptions before I talk about this particular model.

Shredders come in about three groups in my experience.

Group 1--$200 or less for VERY light use for personal documents and small business items. These are the pickiest about what you put in them, need shredder oil the most often and jam the most often. But if you play by the (unwritten) rules, than you should be pretty happy. Perfect if you shred 20 pages or less per day.

Group 2--$200-$800. These are designed for business use and are pretty solid workhorses. They don't jam much and will please you but require a decent upfront investment. They can shred for 15-20+ minutes per use. Perfect if you shred 300 or less pages per day.

Group 3--$800+ These are designed for near consent use and you get a real machine. Less ""features"" but they will shred almost anything.

I explain these groups because many people use high end shredders at work and then expect that type of performance at home from a group one unit. They are completely different items and really shouldn't be compared. Group one shredders are all a pain at times and will cause more hassle but that is the trade off for it being more compact and much cheaper.

The unwritten rules of group one shredders:

1.) Try to shred half of the ""max thickness"" or less. This means on the 49c you shred 4 sheets or less at a time. While it CAN handle more, you are going to heat up the unit which leads to your forced time-out which actually costs you time.

2.) Yes it might shred paperclips but take them off. (Same can go for thicker staples and adhesive/stickers/post it notes). These will slow the shredding process down, wear the teeth down a bit and can make for some bad noises.

3.) Yes, actually use shredder oil. You wouldn't drive your car without oil so why shred so much without oiling the machine? Normally the warranty is void if you don't oil regularly.

4.) Make sure your trash can is emptied regularly so it doesn't cause a jam from the scraps getting stuck in the teeth.

5.) When your shredder doesn't work take time to unplug it and let it sit unused for an hour and re-seat it in the stand/can. The sensors can use both of these things to prevent use (to actually protect your investment).

Now onto the 49c. I gave this four stars because it worked fine in my tests (following my rules above and breaking them). It shredded a decent amount before needing a rest but it would be frustrating for frequent business use. I did not have a jam but the reverse feature didn't seem to work as well as some units in this group. Yes it is loud but that should be expected. It did not seem to shake excessively like some models at this price point. I was able to complete everything it advertises. But it did struggle with 8 sheets of heavier weight paper.

I gave it four stars because I didn't see anything that really set it apart from the crowd and instead it seemed to be very average. If you are using this shredder for regular use, you might want to invest in the very cheap protection plans Amazon is offering. Group one shredders don't have the longest life spans. And get a bottle of oil!

I hope this review has helped you. I received a sample for testing but all of these words are my own. ;)",5,11.100869
3612,"During our most recent restocking of office supplies I was not searching for this product but came across it while ordering other Super Sticky products I use daily.  I was intrigued by the post it note with a tab on it and decided to give it a try.  After opening the package and trying it, I am on the fence about this product.  The pieces are extremely sticky so very difficult to peel off the page or the folder once it is affixed. The adhesive is so strong that on a single piece of paper it feels like super glue was applied.  These notes are not going anywhere once you put them in place; that's for sure.  I bought these because I have a tendency to use my self-sticking notes as reminders at the top of a file vs. the side of the file, so I am finding myself writing not on the line that is printed on each sheet of this product, but across lines the wrong way, which is actually very annoying to do if you are a senior administrative person like me.  I like the concept of these tab style self-sticking notes, but maybe they should not print lines on the paper so they are more versatile in use.  I love that there are two to a pack and that they are different colors.  I gave one to my assistant so that we can easily distinguish her files from mine.  I recommend to Post-It Note to make these in a variety of sizes and please remove the lines (which really are not necessary any way).  If they do that they would have another hit on their hands for sure.  So I gave it three stars for effort.  I am not for this product, nor against it.  I would love to see them redesigned for the real world.  I'm sure Post-It will test market them and get that feedback and we will see that soon.  If my review helped influence your decision in any way, please feel free to mark that its been useful.",3,6.0375433

If you are researching this product you may not understand how it works, it surely looks awkward but its amazingly comfortable to use. Its fast, it has several speeds, and the fast setting is really fast, you can go from one point to the other by just rolling the bar slowly, even on multiple monitors which was my biggest concern, but the bar is able to roll fine from one corner to the other without speed issues.

Your productivity will triple with this device, since now you are very close to your keyboard and pointer, it allows you to switch from type to move and click and back as fast as just moving one finger down.

This is worth every single dollar spend, the quality is great, the features work perfectly and I will surely never go back to any mouse, trackball, touch-pad or any other type of input device after using this mouse.

Please, just do yourself some good and buy it today. You are going to make an investment for your health and your productivity since this is one of the best computer input devices made so far. I absolutely love it.

It should be a norm for companies to implement them for their employees, not just because of health but productivity as well, you are so much faster while doing your job that it will boost productivity big time.

UPDATE: December 1, 2015:

2 years later I still love it. Believe it or not, the pain I had in my right hand is a thing of the past. This is no marketing gimmick people. I really don't experience any wrist and finger pain anymore. I yet have to find something similar for my back (a decent chair). But after trying all possible mouses, trackballs for years, my quest is over. This works. Pain is gone. Productivity is increased. This just makes so much sense for someone using mostly a keyboard.

I also use this now on 4 monitors, I had that concern before purchase as opposed to more gaming or professional mouses. No problems. Even in the middle default speed, I can travel trough all monitors without a single issue. Fast and comfortable.

Dragging things is a pleasure. When you need to send one Windows App from one monitor to the other, this is never going to be same for you, ever.

The only bad thing is that it changes your computer habits, you get so spoiled you are never going to use another mouse again. I can't work in anything anymore, not a phone or tablet, I just need to turn back to my computer because there is nothing like this mouse. Clicking things, and moving your cursor comes natural and you don't have to take away your hand from the keyboard which means you will now use keyboard shortcuts for everything, something most people don't because taking your hand away from your mouse and then back is not a natural movement. If you are a power user, working for hours and hours a day in your computer. Purchase this.

Combine this with a proper keyboard like Das Keyboard and you have a lethal combination. Roller Mouse + Das Keyboard and you will type at light speeds and be able to click and move your cursor at such amazing speeds that people are going to be shocked when they see you working.

In terms of quality I can say I didn't had a single problem. I spelled things over, it has dirt in the bar, and it still looking almost like new. It could use some cleaning but hardware wise, its still working perfectly. This is not a cheap device but its worth every penny if its going to last a few years. Companies should get them for their workers. It will increase their productiviy and make their jobs so much easier.",3,8.870009

Unfortunately, they pack the Pendaflex folders, not hanging on the edges which is the sensible thing to do, but instead curl them up underneath.  What happens:  Scratches against the insides of the black container are numerous for inserting them that way and more scratches uncurling them and taking them out of the box.  I've bought these boxes for years but the carelessness of the new packers is obvious in every box you buy.  No longer any quality control.  Pack the folders separately or leave hanging on the top edges.  Hint:  I don't need the folders as I buy the green Pendaflex folders by the box, so the black ones that come with this container are useless to me.

3621,"I didn't buy this from Amazon - I got it from Sam's club.  For those of you who don't know, Sam's club provides generally very good (though not excellent) quality items.  One can in some sense outsource their research to Sam's and be reasonably happy with the results.

Not here.  This one is mostly a turkey.  Or rather, it could have been much better.

The good:
- many of the labels it ultimately produces are decent.  Not great, but decent.
- until sam's club dumps it, I can pick up more (expensive) labels locally.
- if you like working on batteries, it uses AA and not AAA batteries.
- two line labels - you can put two lines of text on a label.

The bad:
- as almost every review has stated, it wastes about an inch of label on each side of every label, forcing you to trim, ""arts and crafts"" style each label.  absolutely inexcusably horrible engineering.
- horrible UI.  other than the querty keyboard, the UI is idiotic.  fortunately, this is a simple labelmaker so it is possible to sort it, but, again, the engineers should be shot for such a brain-dead interface.
- as far as i can tell, no 'centering' feature. so, text on two-line labels is not centered, which is what most people will want.  maybe it's there and i haven't found it yet.
- idiotic 2-line spacing.  if you use 'small' text size and a two line label, it leaves a giant gap between the lines.  lazy lazy, incompetent engineering.
- 110v ac adapter only.  some of us like travel overseas. not possible with this thing thanks to brother's penny foolishness in making the little ac adapter 110v only.  ""brother: not meant for people who take business trips"" should be their motto.
- expensive tapes.

3622,"I have used several different Canon photo papers during the years that I have had my Canon Pixima MP510, always looking for what seemed to be the best value considering both price and quality of the prints.  I will be looking no longer.  The first thing I noticed when the paper arrived was how heavy the packages of 20 sheets were  compared with the other papers I have used.  The weight difference was confirmed when I looked at a package of Canon Photo Paper Plus, the paper I have been using.  According to the information on the package the weight of the Photo Plus paper is 69 pounds whereas the weight on this paper, the Canon Pro Platinum paper, is 80 pounds.

Not being sure what weight difference contributed to the quality of a print, I did a Google search fir information, learning that:  ""Thicker papers hold up well when there is heavy ink coverage. For full color photos from your desktop, thicker inkjet photo papers are best.""

My Canon printer handled the heavier paper without difficulty and I would expect other Canon inkjet printers to do the same.

Also, ""heavier, thicker papers feel more substantial and can lend visual weight to a project"".

The main test, of course, is how the prints look, and on that score, I could not be more satisfied.  I am also pleasantly surprised at how fast the ink seems to dry on this paper, giving the print a finished look almost immediately.",4,13.323299

3629,"We are using hands-on math for Kindergarten as much as possible so this product is right up our alley.  :) What I like best about Ten-Frame Treasures is the fact that it is both a pretend playset AND math manipulatives. Both my kids (my 3-year-old pirate & 5-year-old princess) loved the magic of the chest and coins right away and enjoyed playing with it by themselves.  Then came a little more direction from me!  We played some of the games and did the activities in the included activity guide and the teacher in me loved the way the concepts were introduced. The set is really versatile - we've used it to practice addition and subtraction with my daughter and to practice beginning counting and recognizing amounts with my son.

Quality:  The materials are a sturdy plastic and both the chest and coins are detailed with the chest and ten-frames made to look like real wood and the coins featuring double-sided raised images (like real treasure!).  All of the pieces fit nicely inside the chest, so it's easy to store them.  The chest does not lock or have any way to secure it closed so you'll want to be sure that it doesn't get knocked over (i.e. coins everywhere).

This is recommended for ages 5 and up but my 3-year-old enjoyed playing with it, too - and it's honestly one of our favorite sets to practice counting with so I would recommend it for preschool age (supervised, of course).

You can still tack them up on a bulletin board or paste them into an album, just as you would with a heavier-weight paper.  The paper doesn't seem to want to curl, so handling is not a problem.

What counts most, at least for me, is the quality of the image, and the images look very nice.  I did a comparison print with the Everyday Photo Paper, HP Advanced Photo Paper, and HP Premium Plus Photo Paper using the same image file on an HP Photosmart D7560 printer.  You can see a difference in the contrast if you look closely, but it is quite small, and you might get the same difference with any semi-gloss paper versus full glossy.  The color is the same.  Give a person a print on the Everyday paper without something to compare it to and they will just think it is a terrific print.  Perhaps some of the other reviewers were using non-HP printers or non-HP inks.

One strange thing -- the paper is labeled 4 by 6 inches but actually measures 4 by 6 1/2 inches and there is no break-away tab.  They say it is for ""handling.""  Not a problem, just an oddity.

3636,"I needed a replacement toner cartridge for my Samsung Xpress M2830DW laser printer because the starter cartridge was finally running out.  I wanted to buy a genuine Samsung toner cartridge, but I couldn't justify the high cost which was nearly double what I paid for the printer.  I decided to buy this EPS toner cartridge based on many good reviews I read.

It works well enough and was simple to install. I simply removed the new cartridge from the packaging, removed the packaging retainers and shook it back and forth about 7 times before sliding it in the printer. Within Samsung's Easy Printer Manager software the cartridge shows as a new replacement MLT-D115L with 100% toner remaining.  The print quality seems good with one exception I'll mention momentarily.  The text and blacks print very dark. I'm not whether the printed pages are actually darker with this toner or if it just seems that way since my starter Samsung cartridge that came with the printer was down to less than 5% left.

Text and basic black line art shows up dark, clear and crisp. The only complaint I have is with printed images.  If I attempt to print a high quality image I notice small, consistent and evenly spaced horizontal banding (small white lines) throughout the image.  It's only noticeable with images so far and text etc. seem fine. The banding isn't horrible but it's definitely noticeable enough to be distracting. If you'll be printing images, handouts with images that need to be clear etc. you may want to stick with the more expensive Samsung OEM cartridge.  I didn't notice any banding  with the original OEM Samsung toner cartridge. I removed everything that needed to be removed from the EPS cartridge and shook it as directed (and then again after I noticed the banding) so I'm not sure why there are small faint lines through images but they're definitely there.

When comparing cartridges for this printer I choose the EPS over other cheaper alternatives because I noticed complaints about poor print quality and banding. Unfortunately spending a little more for the EPS cartridge didn't help me avoid print quality issues.

Fortunately this printer is used mainly for basic business printing of things like black and white labels, text invoices, receipts, packing slips and shipping labels. The cartridge appears to be fine for those purposes.  Since it cost about half the cost of the OEM Samsung cartridge I'm not going to complain too much.  Fortunately this is a black and white printer so it isn't used for many quality critical image printouts. If it was I'd be a little more disappointed.

PROS:
*  Extremely well packed. A bubble/air cushion bag protects the cartridge within the display box and more air cushioning padded the box within the shipping box.
*  Half the cost of the OEM cartridge at most local office supply stores. . IF they even stock it.
*  Quality construction
*  Lifetime Warranty
*  Great instructions
*  A  warning tells you that updating printer firmware could render this cartridge useless. (Please Noe: printer FIRMWARE is the software on the printer itself.  Updating firmware is not the same as updating the SOFTWARE that you run on your computer in order to maintain the printer.)
*  Detailed information on how printer toner manufacturers estimate page yield based on 5% coverage etc.

CONS:
-  Images have horizontal banding that I can't seem to eliminate.",5,14.538623

3640,"This printer replaces our old black and white laser printer. Setup was, in a word, annoying. I'll admit, I haven't set up a new printer in awhile but this just seemed over the top with all the steps and having to register it. The worst part was the need to sign up for an ink plan. I can't say I'm entirely at ease with a company collecting data on how much ink I use and how many pages I print nor do I want automatic shipments of ink but there's no other way to use the printer.

Another word on the instant ink program - you are signing up for a set number of pages at a set price per month. If you go over your allotted pages you have to pay extra, the amount varies depending on how expensive of a plan you selected with less expensive plans charging as much as $1 for 15 extra pages. If you don't use your pages you can only roll over a single month worth of page credits. To put it bluntly this is ridiculous. I don't want to have to track my pages printed nor do I want to pay extra because I printed on January 31st instead of waiting for February 1st. Admittedly, there is the option to purchase regular cartridges but the starter ink that comes in the box cannot be used without registering for the program. I would be fine with purchasing a set number of pages for a set price but I don't like the idea of having to monitor how much I've printed in a given month or of losing prints I've paid for if I happen to not need them that month.

That said, the instant ink system can make sense for those who do lots of printing in color. A page is a page regardless of if it's a large photograph or a double spaced draft quality document. If you can track your prints, use them all without going over, and you print in color you can come out ahead.

Function wise it's a great printer and it saves space if you currently have separate machines for printing, copying, scanning, and/or faxing. Our scans come up clear and printed documents look sharp. I like the design, the controls are intuitive and it looks clean and modern. The quality is excellent with heavy plastic and solid construction. I was pleasantly surprised by how quietly it prints.

So out I ran at 10:30pm to Wally's expecting to pay at least $50 for something basic. Wrong again. For $29 I almost expected it to implode after the 80 pages I needed it to print. I even bought an extra cartridge assuming the one included would just barely make it through the test page. It actually comes with full regular cartridges which was a pleasant surprise.

Truthfully, my plan wouldn't have worked anyway since the input tray only holds 50 sheets (not a deal breaker at all) but it was spitting out the pages so quickly that I stood there in utter amazement. I should explain that it has been at least 10 years since I last owned an inkjet printer. Something must've happened to print speeds in the interim because I couldn't staple them as fast as they were shooting out! Delightful. And as far as the numerous complaints about the lack of USB cable? Puhlease. I have a shoebox full of them for some reason and would have been just as annoyed if I had had to pay for yet another one.

How well will it deal with being lugged around? At $29 if it lasts 6 months I'll be happy. BTW, it comes with a weird tote bag as if they intend for you to lug it around. Hmmm....

Update - As of 8/6/11 the printer is still going strong. Still receives only light use (around 80 pages/month) but works the same as the day I bought it. No regrets. If it breaks anytime soon I'll be replacing it with the same model. Everything else I've seen is too bulky to be carried around.",1008,6.6254983

3647,"With Amazon's stellar return policy I decided ""what the heck,"" and ordered the copycat scanner. I think all hand held scanners basically have the same plus and minus attributes.

Pros:

light

easy to use

even though the product description says the sd card isn't included, I not only had the mini sd card that fits the scanner but an sd adapter card to be able to use it on my computer in the package, that was, as one of the previous reviewers said, an unexpected surprise:)

comes with a cloth sheath so you can carry it to the library or wherever or keep the dust off at home.

There is editing software, or, since it is saved as a jpeg it can be edited by your own software, from some super fancy 500 program to freeware like Gimp. The image can also be edited in programs like word using OCR though I haven't played with that feature yet.

*****************

Obviously flat picture would be the easiest to scan. Figuring out how to get a book to lay flat enough, keeping your hand steady and the scanner straight takes some practice. If the scanner goes crooked the picture will be crooked. I don't consider this a negative unless you consider getting a piano and not being gershwin the first time or several times you try to play:) this is just a matter of practice and wiggling the book around and lining up the arrows that are on the sides of the scanner and realizing that is how much will be scanned, plus the scanning light is in the middle so you have to remember to start above where you want to scan and follow through all the way down.

For books I have found using the non skid kitchen mats that go under cutting boards also keeps it fairly steady so I can concentrate on using both hands to keep the scanner straight and not worry about the book sliding around.

However, in just a few days I can see how much my scans have improved. Don't be afraid to scan sideways either if that makes the fit easier, you can always turn a sideways picture straight with the software. Even go from the bottom up, which has helped on some of the pages I've tried to scan.

The clarity and quality of scans I'm getting make me happy. I have a ton of cookbooks and I want to scan them, upload them to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Living-Cookbook-2011/dp/B00493WILI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Living Cookbook 2011</a>&nbsp;and make some room in my overcrowded house. This scanner is going to be a perfect help.

 Also, because it is light, it could be easily carried to the library and copy pages from book that can't be checked out, it would be perfect for students, say you need to borrow someone's notes, you could literally scan them in a few minutes, hand the notes back, the notes are in the sd card, and bring them home to upload.

The only negative is the spines of the books have to be pretty flat and I could see damage, on the other hand, copiers I have used also require the book to be squished down.

The scanner comes with software, usb cables, batteries, a carrying case, a white cardboard to calibrate, easy to read instructions (and let me tell you, easy to read from me means something, I am so far from a tech wizard it's sad, and even I could understand this)

You can be set up and happily scanning in minutes. Proficient in a few days.",103,12.710724

3649,"I think the Canon Pixma MX850 is great. There's a bit of a learning curve to figure out some of the features and somethings you may have to refer to the manual in order to use them until you familiarize yourself with the printer. I made sure I used all of the functions of this printer and everything works well. I'm really impressed with the speed in which all the functions are carried out and the print and scan quality. The Canon Pixma MX850 has a lot of positives but this product is not perfect so of course it has some negatives.

Positives:
- All the controls are in the front. You don't have to get up out of your chair to do anything. Everything is at your fingertips.
- It's wireless. I've got my MacBook hooked up to this printer wirelessly, though it wasn't an easy setup. However, the Canon rep. I talked to was very helpful in walking me through the process. Once it was set up, documents print out flawlessly just as if it were connected to the printer via a USB connection. I also have my HP desktop computer hooked up via a wired network connection.
- It takes most types of media cards so if you don't want to hook up your camera via USB cable and you would rather take out your media card and view and print your pictures that way, you can.
- Prints quietly
- The printer has a bright color LCD screen, which is especially useful when you put in your media card and you want to view or make any adjustments to your photos before you print them.
- Fast 20-22 sec. 4x6 photo prints
- Photos print out beautifully
- Prints documents almost immediately, no long thinking or waiting time and they print out fast. One color documents print out fast even in the standard setting.
- The text prints out clear and crisp. The ink dries fast so there isn't any smudging.
- Auto two-sided printing(Duplex printing)
- Comes with software that allows OCR(optical character recognition) meaning you can scan a document then the program will translate it into editable format. In other words, the document you scan in will become a text document that you can edit. Instead of having to type over a whole document, you can scan it and make changes to it once transformed into text format. This program is a part of the Canon Utilities bundle that is included with this printer. The bundle also contains other neat programs with a variety of features.
- Too many other great features to numerous to name

Negatives(a very short list):
- The size. The Canon MX850, as has been said, is enormous and very heavy. This printer takes up quite a bit of space on my small desk. Though this wasn't a deal breaker for me, I do wish it was smaller. Canon really has to work on reducing the size of their all-in-ones.
- I also don't like the fact that when I open the lids of the print, whether it's the scanner lid or the cover that you have to open to put in the ink, doesn't slam down softly or smoothly. I always feel like I'm slamming them down even though I'm not plus the lids are not exactly light either.

Despite the size of the Canon MX850, it's very attractive looking and pretty easy to use. There are plenty of menu options for you to adjust the printer the way you want it to function. I even got it to work as a CD label printer by hooking up a a removable CD label tray. This can be purchased on the net. All in all, this is a fantastic printer with excellent features and I'm glad I decided to purchase it.",8,14.316944

3654,"Wow, this is a vast improvement over my 8 year old shredder...no doubt about that, but it stands on its own in features, ability, and QUIETNESS!  Fellowes is an excellent brand so, even before checking reviews, I knew this would be the brand for me this time around.

First of all, I love how much more quiet this is than my old 5 sheet shredder.  It doesn't make that type of sound, like you are putting a body into a wood chipper, like the old ones did so that is a vast improvement.

I love not having to open up every credit card solicitation envelope, unfold everything, then shred.  This shredder will take it right down, as long as it isn't a particularly thick item (up to 15 sheets).

So far I tried it on one credit card...zip! done!  That rocks!  The safety features are great.  I tested it by just running my hand over the top while shredding. The safety light came on and it stopped immediately.

The shredder came with a couple of the liner bags.  I appreciate that because I can decide if I like them before buying them.  I'm not sure I'm going to like them and they really aren't necessary since the bin slides out easily for disposing of the contents.  It also came with a little bottle of oil.  It looks like enough oil to last a good long time, so don't bother buying the upsell bottle of oil!

There are wheels, two of which have breaks, that easily snap in (this is nice because this shredder is large and kind of heavy).  The instruction sheet for that doesn't tell, or show, you where the ones with breaks go so I don't know if it matters, but I put them on the back.

It also comes with a little vertical file type thing that you slide on to the back.  I suppose that is for your shredding pile but I am using it for the bags, oil, and the instruction booklet.  With this bad boy I don't think I am going to let a backlog of shredding pile up!  zip zip and you're done.

I think my two favorite features are the quietness and the slide out bin.  My old one sounds like a chainsaw murder scene, plus I had to disassemble it and take the entire bottom to the trash for emptying.",102,7.6913857

3665,"I like these floral RFID card protectors. This pack of 10 comes in 5 floral patterns that make it easy to identify which card you are grabbing before pulling it out of the sleeve. They fit nicely in my wallet pockets because of their thin material.

These RFID sleeves are thinner than others I've tried and that's a big plus for me. Unlike thicker cardboard ones these fit into my wallet pockets just fine. These are like thin paper/plastic with a metallic coating between the inside and outside layers. The only down side is they can be a tiny bit tricky to open for card insertion.  Bottom line: these don't add annoying bulk like cardboard ones.

Be sure to put the chipped end of your CC into the sleeve first for best protection. Even a partially exposed chip might be read remotely!

If you keep your sleeved CC's in the same pocket as a near field car key fob (for automatic door unlock like on my Prius) you might find it is not working all the time! If the fob is behind your protected CC's in your pocket they may block the fob's signal too. Just something to be aware of and I now have the habit of putting my key on the outside.

These help protect my credit cards and passport card (these are also chipped!) RFID chip information with a metallic shield in the thin material. This is the important feature: a very serious function in a simple and fun/pretty package.

US CC companies have been replacing their older magnetic stripe only cards with RFID chipped cards. By now that process should be almost complete. These cards can be used to pay by just placing them near a terminal or inserting them into a CC slot. Near Field Communications (NFC) in most modern cell phones is a close cousin of RFID and can read some RFID chips from several feet away!! These RFID chip cards are closely related to ApplePay and GooglePay. It is important not to be an easy target by protecting your cards from being read by hacker/thieves.

If you Google ""CC Chip Theft"" you should get a bunch of information on why it is important to protect your CC chip from being read. It may also be shocking to see how easy it is to read them! These protectors are a simple and fun solution.

I like these floral CC protectors for my chipped cards and the thin material does not cause problems with my wallet. The floral patterns make it easy to pull out the card I want on the first try. For helping make security simple and a little fun I think these attractive and think RFID protection sleeves deserve 5 stars.

The Steelmaster inbox comes with four rubber feet to add on to the bottom to protect your furniture and includes two keys for the lock, which turns smoothly. This is a professional quality inbox that would look good and work well in a very nice office setting, or it could be used at home. We've had a lousy system at home sorting through personal and business mail (my husband basically tosses the stack wherever suits him) and this is great for the home office so we can separate out from personal mail the business correspondence and checks and even lock away the checks and important documents in the confidential bin (we've lost a few checks lately due to disorganization). I would also absolutely love to have a second Steelmaster for my office downtown as it looks great, and I get a lot of confidential correspondence in the line of work I'm in. This truly surpasses my expectations and is an excellent product that I highly recommend.",2,8.01185
3692,"I purchased my first laminator and had no idea what thermal pouches to purchase. I was not sure what brand would be best and what thickness would be most effective, the 3mil or 5mil. After much thought I finally decided to give these a try and I'm really glad I did! I don't have anything to compare them to as this was my first time using these; however, they worked great and I didn't have any issues. These are the 3mil. When I run out I will be purchasing more!",15,4.207959
3693,Does what it is suppose to do.  Hold on tight it does.  But buyer be ware . . . you do need to screw them together evenly and tightly to make it hold best.  It works best when they are screwed tightly together because it holds the contacts in perfectly..  You can buy this same brand cheaper if your willing to wait for them coming in from china.  Or if you need a lot more for less.  But honestly I didn't have the patience nor did I need like 100 of them.,10,3.6799502
3694,"The printer was well-packaged and took about three minutes to unpack and plug in (power and USB).  I had to read the instructions to figure out where to put the paper but that was straightforward.  The paper guide seemed a bit flimsy but I'll rarely change it so it might not make a difference.

I plugged it into my iMac and immediately a message popped up that said, ""Would you like to download and install the software?""  Sure.

10 seconds later I was ready to go.

I didn't shake the ink cartridge like the instructions said to do but the print came out almost as clear the copy off my Xerox Phaser laser-jet printer and it printed slightly faster and more noisily.

To scan, I went to OSX System Preferences - Print & Scan, chose the Samsung, Scan, Open Scanner, Show Details, and scanned.  Took a really long time and I then I found it had scanned a bunch of pieces.  I looked at the details page and noticed I had Auto Selection set to Detect Separate Items.  Cool.  So I switched to Detect Enclosing Box, upped the resolution to 200, set it to scan to the desktop, and got a good image quickly.

I couldn't figure out how to fax without installing the included software (which I hate doing).  It took a couple of minutes to install with an error message and an IP address screen I couldn't understand.  Rebooted.  Followed the instructions and couldn't get the machine to fax.  Couldn't read the menu screen without a flashlight.  Tried it again and managed to successfully fax a document.

Tried to print from the Samsung Network PC Fax but couldn't find it as an option on my print menu.  Went back to the installer disk and installed (reinstalled?) MAC_FAX.  Rebooted.  Still no Network PC Fax option.  I've been at this for an hour now and am getting really frustrated.

The documentation includes 7 pages of instructions for wireless access but I don't have a wireless network so I just stapled those pages and trashed the other 60 pages in other languages.

Pros
- Printer and scanner worked easily right out of the box.  Good quality print and scan.
- Fax machine took a little setup but eventually worked.
- This is a heavy machine and does not seem as flimsy as others have described.  Granted my $400 Epson scanner is more solidly built but you don't always need a Buick parked on your desk.

Cons
- Maybe I have a burnt out bulb or something but the menu screen on the printer is unreadable.  Samsung, tell me how to fix.  I know you are reading this.
- Never could get the Samsung Network PCF Fax to work.
- Bulky but smaller than all of my separate peripherals.
- No prompt for online registration.  I find it easier to get assistance if I have a problem if the product has been registered.

If you need an all-in-one and don't need color or photo printing, for the money, this is a decent choice.",7,8.820588
3695,"We have four desktop computers (two for gaming and two for TV/movie/music media centers), three tablets and multiple other phones/wireless devices which means we tend to print a lot. We've gone through a multitude of printers over the years, some reliable, others not so much. Our current printers were both giving us problems with either jamming or constantly running out of ink so we were in the market for a dependable replacement. The HP ENVY 5660 Wireless All-In-One Inkjet Printer fits our needs quite nicely. Here are my thoughts;

Pros

+ Web browser options are extremely convenient, especially for scanning.

+ Touch LCD screen makes navigating menus much easier than past printers we've owned.

+ Able to receive documents by email and print them automatically, including from mobile devices.

+ Replacement cartridges can be monitored by an affordable subscription (HP Instant Ink) which monitors your printer usage and automatically sends you an ink cartridge when

low.

+ Wireless and the set up was fast and simple.

+ Quick to print, especially for an inkjet.

Cons

- We were unable to get scans to process in PDF format and were only able to scan as JPG.  Still haven't figured out why exactly even after lengthy troubleshooting.

- Still has the limited cartidge longevity of an inkjet printer.

The HP ENVY 5660 Wireless All-In-One Inkjet Printer is a compact and versatile inkjet printer. Suitable for all of your home office needs it's able to get all of your basic printing jobs done and in a timely manner.

The HP Photosmart D110A has a multitude of options and prints in color. Unfortunately, the inkjet cartridges (both color and black) were always running out of ink and constantly needing replacement. The Brother HL-2070N was a great printer that lasted us many years and amazingly we were still on the original toner. Sadly, the rubber rollers inside began to wear and the printer would end up jamming with every print job. Repairing the unit would have cost a minimum of 50 dollars which just didn't seem worth it in the long run. Therefore, we began to look for a complete replacement for both printers. The HP ENVY 5660 Wireless All-In-One Inkjet Printer was a perfect replacement for our HP Photosmart D110A. At some point we'll probably invest in another laser printer with the capabilities of the HP ENVY 5660 Wireless All-In-One Inkjet Printer but until then it suits our household printing needs just fine.",14,9.472445
3696,"I agree with other reviewers on the good points of waterproof, mobile, thin-but-flexible and a good texture for my mouse...

...but I am a gamer with limited desk space.  I use my mouse to move and target imaginary things.  A lot.  I may well be switching back to a fabric mousepad soon, or just buying another one of these to wear out all over again, depending, because the ""pad"" is made of a fairly soft, gently textured plastic with a printed pattern underneath.  What happens when you rub something repeatedly in the same spot with, say, the bottom of your mouse as you maneuver it around the pad..?  Polish happens.  Polished plastic, to be precise, bright and shiny, glossy, reflecting my optical mouse's cursor all over the screen, exactly the way the surface the pad was bought to cover used to do.

It's a good product, and really, if I had paid attention to the logic of, ""if it's flexible enough to peel off of a desk and move, it HAS to be soft plastic,"" going in, I would have known in advance that it would be likely to happen within a few months of use.  It's my own fault for blindly expecting something the material itself can't do.  I've been trying to switch up angles, move where the mouse rests, etc., but my space for that is swiftly diminishing.  The fact that it's so nice and portably small means there really isn't that much room for doing so to begin with. :)",2,5.794594

3699,"I bought this monitor arm some months ago and I feel comfortable enough now to right this review.

*Installation:* It comes with all the needed tools and adapters to either attach it to the edge of your desk or drill through it (you will obviously need a drill for that). I went ahead and mounted a 27-in monitor as it was well within the arm's weight limit (LED monitors are way lighter than the previous LCD technology).

Somebody will have to help you holding the monitor when installing it on the arm if you have a big monitor.

*Design:* It really complements apple products, the design is simple and elegant. The adjusting mechanism is the best out there in my opinion and here is why: other products move in two axis when adjusting them, so if you want to bring the monitor closer to you for example, you end up also moving it either up and down a little bit. With this monitor arm you set the height first and then you can move the monitor to the sides, front and/or back. This is a huge plus as you can keep a somewhat ""fixed"" ergonomic height when adjusting it.

I would feel more comfortable if the base was a little bit wider. I haven't found any problems at all, but I think a wider base would limit any movement of the vertical element.

*Usage:* you can easily move the monitor in pretty much every direction. Movement is not exactly ""fluid"", but is adequate in general.",4,9.614473

The categories I wrote was: LADIES CLOTHING, KIDS CLOTHING, TOYS, BOOKS, MISC.
Later, I got a phone call and the lady in charge of distributing the items thanks me over and over as those easy to read labels (Avery of course), save her so much time!

**To make the ink last longer:

1) As soon as you have finished your writing with the marker, put the cover back on it.
2) To FULLY SEAL UP THE COVER - Hold the marker down with the cap facing down. Tap it FIRMLY THREE TIMES. This seems to lock the top and keep the freshness of the ink to prevent it from drying out.

I don't like that it doesn't latch UNLESS it's LOCKED. You CAN'T just snap it closed, lift it by the handle and move from this table to that one; you'd have to lock it, or carry it from underneath. *If* someone tried it, not knowing, they might pop the lid closed, grab the handle and ^PULL^, resulting in a MESS of coins pinging everywhere. So make sure whomever is handling it KNOWS not to pick it up unless it's LOCKED.

But it's fine for basic change-making requirements. The clips make sure that if you're outside at an event, your bills aren't going to blow away. I definitely wanted a cash box with separate places for each bill denomination. A pad of checks and the cash vouchers fit underneath the tray.

3709,"Well, it is a pretty good portable board for drawing. After adjusting the wire system, the parallel bar works flawlessly. I was able to improve it by adding some felt tape to the inside knobs so it does not slide plastic on plastic, which makes it move very smoothly.

The angles are comfortable, and you can get it to tilt forward more by resting the edge over the table, which is a nice feature. Note that this only gives you a few more degrees... It is not as versetile as a drafting table or a wacom stand that can do any angle. It is plenty sturdy though. If you really want it steeper, you could just set some wood under the feet, or better yet, attach some folding shelf brackets to the back.

I would stay away from the smaller models, as the wire system will prohibit you from using this in your lap, or in bed. This is really designed to be used on a table.

The board came with some faint scratches on the surface, and one of the pulley wheels was off center. Alvin sent me a replacement pully quickly, which was nice and convenient. The scratches are not a big problem, they are barely visible, and I have a vynil cover over the board anyhow.

Vyco covers work well. I got a transparent one and secured it to the top of the board with some 3M mounting tape. This allows me to put reference images underneath.",10,7.8071704

Unfortunately, while the basic three are strong colors, and the purple is nice and dark, but the teal, orange, green and pink are neon. Not what I would call 'vivid' like it says on the package. I'll still use the heck out of these, but the neon colors will be much less useful for notes and such.

Honestly, I don't see much difference between the XFine and the Medium tips. XFine is more like a traditional Sharpie tip, where the medium is more of a marker looking tip. But they write pretty much the same. Think there is a little more control with the fine, but, could be my imagination. Forgive the sloppy writing - some of us don't fare well without lines. :)

3714,"Brother P-Touch 1180 is a very good label printer for home or office. It has a whisper- quiet operation and the batteries last a good long time. The printer can accommodate label widths of six, nine, or twelve millimeters so it can be used for many different tasks.

There are five sizes and several different styles that can be programmed on this label printer. Italic print, boldface, outline, shadow, and different combinations of the above can be utilized to create different effects. There aren't a multitude of styles and sizes, like you get with more expensive label printers, but there are enough selections to accommodate most needs. And the liquid crystal display makes it easy to see what you are about to print.

I have few complaints with this label printer, but one of them is worth noting: the printer's tendency to waste labels. When you print a label, the printer will always release sections of blank tape on both sides of the worded area. It does this, presumably, to make sure you have enough blank area to cut. But this can prove to be very wasteful because, most of the time, you will not need all of this blank label. What I try to do is type in multiple names in a row, separated by a space, and then print at once. This will minimize the amount of blank label coming out from the printer. There is a limit of 55 total characters in each run, so you can't input any number of names you wish. You are still a little bit limited, but this is still more efficient than entering one name at a time and pressing the print button after each one.

This printer isn't the greatest, but for the price, it's difficult to argue a convincing case against the Brother P- Touch 1180 label printer. It's small, quiet, and gets the job done with minimal effort and cost as long as you conserve the label by entering multiple names at the same time.",16,8.29813

She is a laminating junkie and laminates just about everything she can including pictures, proof of insurance certificates, newspaper clippings, recipe cards and even recipes pulled from magazines. Its important to note that my mother is about as anti tech as one can possibly get. It took me a couple years just to get her operating a Mac laptop efficiently. When it comes to technology, she finds even the simplest of things difficult, lol. Anyways, she figured out how to operate the laminating machine in just a few minutes. That's how simple it is to use this system.

The pouches are fantastic as they make aligning of the item super easy. You just pop the item into the pouch and send it through the laminating machine and your all set.

Considering how cheap the laminating machine is, something like this is a no-brainer for people like my mother. The pouches run anywhere from 20 to 33 cents each depending on size.

3719,I use these inserts for a sort of daily scratch journal. I originally used them with a Lamy Al-Star and Noodler's burgundy and purple inks. The paper holds ink really well and doesn't bleed through. There is a slight ghosting but not enough to affect legibility. I had a terrible time with Moleskine journals and fountain pens. The only problem I had with the regular Noodler's inks was smearing. The paper in this insert has a bit of sheen and slickness to it which is really nice but the inks take a long time to dry. I tried switching pens because the Lamy was just so wet but even with the Pilot Metropolitan it was still smearing. I switched to Noodler's Q'Ternity which is the blue-black version of their fast-drying Bernanke ink and it works perfectly. No smearing at all. No bleed through. Minimal ghosting. The Midori papers are fabulous. The paper is really thin but I really like it for my scratch paper journal. I made a cover for it from an old pocket folder and use a Midori band to keep the cover in place and just slip in the back of my Traveler's Notebook so I can pull it out quickly and lay it flat.

3723,"This is a review of the Epson 2880 photo printer, not the 1900. I seriously considered the 1900 but I'm very glad I chose the 2880 instead.

This is the sixth Epson photo printer I've owned. They've all been excellent, but this one is the best by a wide margin. I'm extremely fussy about print quality, and the 2880 exceeded my expectations ""right out of the box"". I had read about that, but I hadn't expected it to be true. It is - right out of the box, using the downloadable Epson profiles for the 2880, prints are almost identical to the images' appearance on my calibrated monitor. Differences between printed and monitor appearance are very subtle, probably not noticeable unless I'm sitting right at the monitor and comparing the two. I will make custom printer profiles for my 2880, but at this point I'm not sure I can do much better than the downloadable Epson profiles. No other photo printer I've used has even come close to this quality.

Before I go further though, I want to address a few things in addition to the excellent print quality. Most of the things below address the negatives I've read in about 15% of the reviews of this printer. [DISCLAIMER - I'm an amateur photo enthusiast, very fussy about print quality but with no commercial interest at all. I have no relationship with Epson, except as a very satisfied customer.]

First - Epson customer service: others report bad experiences. I haven't needed customer service or technical assistance for the 2880, but over an 11 year period, I have had to call upon Epson for help several times with previous printers. Each and every time, Epson service has been wonderful - beyond expectations.

Second - small size of the ink cartridges - this is inconvenient and relatively expensive for those who print in large volumes, but they will benefit from a ""Constant ink supply"" using tanks of ink. That would be a bad choice for me, since my print volumes are usually not large. Leaving pigment inks sitting in the printer for weeks at a time is a guarantee that you'll get clogged ink nozzles - an annoying and time consuming problem. OEM Epson inks are available from a couple of reliable vendors at prices significantly less than Epson's. I'm quite willing to pay the prices for these excellent inks, which give me superb prints which will last for many years.

Third - need to switch out Matte black and Photo black - yes, this is slightly annoying, but in my case it's not much of a problem. I normally print color. On those occasions when I want to print black and white, I'll just wait until I have a number of prints to make, switch the inks, and print them all at once. The availability of the excellent RIP for the 2880 more than compensates for the annoyance and expense of switching black carts.

Fourth -  size of the machine: the 2880 doesn't take much more desk space (""real estate"") than my ancient R800 printer, which printed only 8X10s. In fact it doesn't take up ANY more space than my beloved R1800, which died after years of faithful service. The 2880 prints just fine with the paper holder and the output tray at their minimum heights. In that configuration, the 2880 measures just 23 1/2 by 18 inches. Yes, when I make 13X19 inch prints, I'll want to extend those trays, but I won't need that for everyday photo printing.

Fifth - this is the quietest printer (of any kind) we have used. My wife noticed that right away.

Sixth - Setup - This is not instant, but it's very simple. Basic setup took me about 30 minutes, and half of that time was the installation of the 2880 software bundle. Downloading and installing the Epson profiles took another 30 minutes or so. I always print from Qimage rather than from Photo Shop, but (for those who are not already familiar with color management)I noticed that on its web site, Epson has an excellent and easy-to-follow tutorial on how to use the 2880 profiles.

Speed - the 2880 print speeds are not fast, and I don't want them to be. I always set printers for max quality rather than for speed. Using the max quality settings, a 4X6 inch print takes about 2 minutes (though to be honest I didn't time it). When I print in volume, my habit is to set up the printer queue, and then go have lunch or watch the news on TV.

You're wondering how long I've had this printer. Only a few days. My past experience with Epson printers indicates that this means it's unlikely that I'll have significant problems for a very long time to come. I'll make sure to update this review when I've owned and used the printer for at least a couple of months.

****ADDENDUM - I've now had the 2880 for several months. It has printed many dozens of 8X10 photos, perhaps 2 dozen 12X18s - all of those on either Epson Premium Lustre or Epson Presentation Matte. It has also printed countless pages of B&W text, on plain paper (I had intended to reserve the 2880 for photo printing, but my wife can't remember to switch). I loved my old 1800, but this one is far superior. Using either lustre paper or plain paper, ink use is not excessive at all. Using matte paper, it does soak up some ink - but that's what you have to expect, in order to get excellent prints. The downloaded Epson ""premium"" printer profile for lustre paper is spot on in every respect - no need for a custom profile, even for the most critical of viewers. The profile for Epson Presentation Matte paper is okay, probably good enough for 95+% of people, but it's not perfect. I made my own custom profile for Epson Presentation Matte, using the Spyder3Print profiler - a simple, straightforward thing to do which took only about 30 minutes total (printing, then tweaking the initial result). I still rate this printer ""more than 5 stars"".

3725,"The badge holder has a duel wearable design: you can either attach it to your belt loop via caribener style or use the clip on back to slip in on your belt itself. Each has it's own advantages depending on how you plan to use it.

Caribener Style: Most secure design hanging from your belt loop of your pants. It's ideal if you need you just need a wireless/NFC badge access to the building or to clock in/out for work. The caribener is easy to put on, but a bit tough to remove especially when it's not right in front of you. Also it may dangle around a bit when speed walking (or faster speed) depending on how your badge is positioned (vertically or horizontally)

Clip Style: The clip is very tight on the badge holder which is good since you don't want it to hang loose. It fits very securely to your belt, pants itself, or shirt pocket. It doesn't dangle around a lot when active like the caribener style, but the caribener portion sticks out a bit which looks very odd. Also the clip may have a shorter shelf life compared to the caribener style depending on how rough you are with it. Clip style is ideal if you need to physically hand off your badge to someone often, have to hang your badge above the waist, or if you use your card holder as a money/credit card wallet and need to unclip it for access.

Retractable cord works very well. Love the zip-line like sound it makes when in use.

The build quality of the badge holder is of really good quality. All the attachment points are very tight as sturdy for more security. It's larger than what it looks in the stock photos, but it's very light weight.

Overall depending on how and what you use your badge for there's a different style of wear for everyone.",23,7.415148

Very helpful!
Two things to note: The size of the scale is surprisingly small and streamlined. (*See photo for relative scale.) I was expecting something considerably larger. Also, the scale has a rubberized finish. Its a slightly tacky, non-slip coating. Personally, Im not crazy about it. That kind of surface is hard to clean and seems to attract, and hold, dust and lint. Sometimes, with age, these surfaces are prone to breakdown and peeling.

Well, that was simple AND quick.

There was a slight smell before we started, when the machines was just starting up. I have noticed it several times since then, too. My daughter immediately put it to use, laminating some artwork to make into lanyards for friends. She found it especially easy to use. After using the included pouches, I ended up finishing out the Fellows pouches I had left over. I can say that Scotch pouches were better quality, less bubbles, more shine.

3760,"This is a replacement for a dying Artisan 725. A very nice improvement over the discontinued Artisan printer in some ways. The document feeder is nice, the ink situation is interesting with the large black cartridge for non-photo printing, the large menu screen. However there a significant change that might affect how you like this printer.

For some reason Epson decided to automate the printed paper tray instead of letting the user manually slide the tray out on their own. I guess people would forget and printed documents would fall all over and this generated complaints to Epson. It's an OK feature but it seems that Epson used the mechanics from a previous feature to automate the paper tray. I use the CD printing feature a lot and in the Artisan series, the CD tray was automated. It slid out, you put the CD in and then pressed a command and the printer pulled the tray in to print on the CD. With the Expression 830, you have to wait for a command from the printer, then manually slide a loose tray into a specialized slot in the printer in specific way (there are arrows to guide you) and then hit the command button on the menu screen. Instead of simply placing the CD in a tray, you have to fool with this loose, flat piece of plastic every time. So now the CD tray is manual and the outgoing paper tray is automated and it takes longer to print each CD. Not an improvement for me.

Some additional observations now that I've worked with this for awhile:
The control panel is motorized for some reason so it swivels up and down when you turn on the printer. This wouldn't be much of an issue except it moves on it's own if the printer hasn't been used for some time so suddenly the printer starts making noises at unexpected times. If you want to turn the printer off and the screen has gone dark, the panel starts swiveling around after your first touch and then settles to a position where you can finally turn it off. Why is it programmed this way?
The paper feed works well for copying but if you are trying to scan a multi-page PDF (at least on a Mac) expect some problems using the network connection. The printer scans all the pages but only the first page ever makes it into the PDF file. Is this a Mac or Epson problem? No idea. (Update: It's a Mac printer driver problem which now happens with my older Epson printer now on another computer. [Update to the update: Epson drivers have been updated and now the document feeder to multi-page PDF works well.]) If you want to initiate a scan from the printer, the Epson has to be directly connected by USB not networked. Don't know if it works that way or not yet.

A very big annoyance is the lack of warning before an ink cartridge runs out. The black ink ran out just as I had to print something last week. No warning prior to that. The old 725 warned me weeks before I actually ran out, now from the 830, nothing. Fortunately I still had the old 725 and it cooperated enough to print until I was able to rush to the store and get a replacement ink. I recommend that you get a replacement hi-capacity black ink with a purchase of this printer, the included cartridge is a regular capacity ink.

One year later: The printer now leaks black ink randomly. I now exclusively use the old 725 for CD printing as the 830 ruins the printing on CDs with ink blotches. Paper printing isn't as bad but I am getting a Canon printer to replace the 830, Ive had enough of this.",7,9.021696

3768,"I had a lot of year end papers to go through and decided to purchase a confetti shredder to help prevent identity theft.  I gathered up a bunch of papers to be shredded and tested out my new shredder.  I love it.  You have to remove the styrofoam wedged between the unit and the removeable can first, plug it in, test that the safety light works and then it's good to go.  I was going through all my year end papers for about 4 hours, shredding large amounts of papers while I went - the shredder never gave out on me once.  I counted out 11 pages and it shreds them easily, albeit a little slower than it would shred 1 piece.  I'm not sure what the limit of it is, but it was chewing up big handfuls of paper, staples, credit cards, all with ease.  Didn't jam up or have any problems.  I like how simple and reliable it is to use.  The next few days after that, my boyfriend has been using it a lot as he went through his year end papers without any problems either.

I do have 2 small complaints.  Small, meaning - they don't bother me and would not deter me from buying this product again.

1.  It's still messy - but that may just be the nature of the beast.  It's a LOT less messy than the shredders where you have to lift off the motor to empty the paper bin (I MUCH prefer this style).  When you're shredding, the bin holds everything nicely, but when you're emptying out the bin, expect to have to vacuum a little afterwards.

2.  There was a little rubber pad that was glued onto the base - I'm assuming it was a nonskid rubber pad for the bin to rest on - well that promptly came unglued and I just tossed it.  Still, it would have been nice if it was more securely fastened.

What I like about it:

1.  It's a good price.  I think it was the cheapest I would have to spend for a reliable unit that worked well, looked good, and held enough shredded paper that I didn't have to empty the bin every few minutes.

2.  I like the pull out bin rather than have to wrestle lifting off the entire motor, dropping bits of paper all over the floor while I empty the bin.  The pullout bin is very easy to empty out.

3.  It's more attractive than other units.

4.  Worked very well and I don't foresee it giving out any time soon.  Very sturdy unit, yet small enough to tuck out of the way - like a regular trash can.

5.  One large slot that everything goes into and it chewed up everything I threw out it.  It's simple design works very well and is quite efficient.

I ordered some shredder lubricant to go with it.

3776,"I was a little disappointed with the size of his paper shredder. But it works efficiently and has a credit card shredder and CD shredder.

The basket it very small so you have to empty it often, if you do a lot of shredding.

This is not a shredder for a business, but it is fine for home use where you shred only a few documents a week.

It you do a lot of shredding at once, the machine will overheat and stop. The instructions tell you if this happens, wait twenty minutes and then try again. I did and it worked fine.

One thing I didn't realize when I ordered it is that it is not a cross cut shredder. But for what I use it for, that doesn't make much of a difference to me.

3777,"The ""open"" tubular coin tubes are MUCH easier to use than those (of other brands) which come folded flat.

Smaller coin tubes come packed within the larger ones (to minimize the size of the box)---so fishing out, say all the 5 cent tubes, might be annoying.  Large operations should probably buy each size tube separately.  For ordinary home or small institution coin-packing, no problem---you'll probably used several sizes at a session anyway.

I've formerly used a (commercial?) kind of tube which came with one end already rolled, which was much more convenient for hand-packing.  Unfortunately, those wouldn't work with the plastic coin ""packing"" device that I now use.

Otherwise, the simple tubes worked perfectly.  I found no defects.  I had no problems.

3778,"I'm a part-time legal secretary handling small claims debt collection paperwork, so I use a calculator at work every day (and a printing calculator makes it easier to catch mistakes).  I had inherited an ancient Canon printing calculator with an LED display from the previous secretary, and the display had either faded out or was getting increasingly washed out by the glare from the overhead fluorescent lights.  I went ahead and picked up this model at Walmart last month, and for the most part am quite happy with it.  The LCD display doesn't seem to be affected by glare from overhead lights, and with 12 digits I can do interest calculations on larger debts (the old calculator had only an 8-digit display).  I was able to figure out how to load paper rolls and change the ink cartridge from the included instruction sheet (and considering I normally throw myself upon the mercy of the office manager for help with that sort of thing, I was quite pleased not to need help).
The only complaint I have about the Casio HR-100TM is that the ink roller which came with the calculator was dried out (only the red ink worked).  The local Walmart store didn't carry spare ink rollers for this model, so I had to order them online (I searched for the specific ink roller model number named in the documentation).  With a fresh ink roller safely loaded in the machine, the printing function of this calculator is now flawless.  Great value for the money, especially for small & home offices!",10,8.094508

The catch for the legs is a spring-loaded system with a flimsy plastic catch. It takes considerable strength to squeeze the spring enough to make it work at all. The catch is obviously going to break if it goes through repeated cycles.

All in all, this is an OK table if you're going to use it infrequently or if you plan to set it up and keep it set up. It's not that great a choice for an instant table, which is what I was hoping for.

I'm a long-time collector of writing instruments generally, fountain pens primary. Let there be zero doubt this is not a fountain pen irrespective of techie (5th) generation. That said, the point offers better performance than many fine line or porous point pens in ""adapting"" to the users hand (a bit). Parker historically did some innovative designs for fountain pens - iconic 51,Titanium, 180s, 75s - but putting a ""hood"" over a vinyl or fiber tip is probably more attentive to recurring income (refills) than to fountain pen innovation. The pen writes very smoothly, leaves a well-defined line, but the refill is quirky, i.e., when initially installed it's slow to begin writing and tends to dry out quickly even if in regular use - Refill life is poor to awful.

If you use it for receipts in the car or some such thing, keep in mind, they could easily fall out as you pull the plastic sleeves out of the vertical file. It's hard to look in because it's so narrow at the bottom that looking in it might require you to pull everything out and then putting everything back might not be that easy.

3801,"I've used Sharpie ultra fine point, in all colors for many years, with red & blue being my favorite colors.  My stock of red was getting low, so it was time to replenish my stock.

The pros:
+ These were an Amazon add-on item, with free shipping when I bought 3 boxes.
+ Lots of colors & tip sizes to choose from.
+ The ink is alcohol based, which makes the removal very easy on nonporous surfaces.
+ Advertised -  Bright, colorful red ink makes a vivid impression.
+ Advertised -  Ultra-fine tip lays down razor sharp lines.
+ Advertised -  Ink dries quickly, resists smearing and fading and is water resistant.
+ Advertised -  12 Red Sharpie permanent markers per box.

The cons:
- The design has changed since I last purchased these.  The tip length is noticeably shorter... feels odd after using the older version with the longer tip extension.
- All colors, with the exception of black will fade, when exposed to UV light.
- The ink doesn't flow right away, which I find annoying!  I didn't have to ""prime"" the ink by drawing circles with the previous version of this pen.  This appears to happen with some of the pens, but not all of them!?

Closing remarks:
 The black & green color, especially the green is problematic, with the ink flow being much less smooth, compared to the red & blue color.
 These are like ultra fine permanent marks, so they will bleed thru thin paper.
 On the attached pictures, I compare the old & new tip design.

I like the horizontal pockets and the reference info on the inside.  However this is the first year that son #1 had to carry them in a Trapper keeper.

That is a brand name for the large, zippered 3 ringed carriers that kids have.  On the school supply list this was mentioned as a must have.  These folders did not make it past first semester.  The holes ripped right through, but the rest of the folder was intact and nearly pristine.  So I replaced them with the Trapper Keeper plastic folders.  We'll see how that goes.

In previous years son #1 used these folders without the zippered carrier and they made it through the entire year in pretty good  condition.  They looked like they had been used but the the folder itself stood up to the wear.

I give them 3 stars because since the folders have the holes, clearly it is meant these can be used in binders.  However when you use the folders in a binder, the folders don't hold up and they are pricey.

3811,"I started coloring in adult coloring books a few months ago.  I've use Marco Raffine pencils, Artist Loft pencils, Bic Marking markers, Sharpie markers, Artist Loft markers, Stabilo fineline markers, several brands of gel pens, and other things.  I thought there couldn't be much of a difference between the Marco Raffine pencils & Prismacolor premier pencils.  Then I bought 1 Prismacolor scholar pencil.  The minute I used it, I realized what a difference there was.  Then Amazon had a special on the 75ct Prismacolor Premier pencil set.  These are extraordinary pencils.  I am having so much fun blending different colors to get different effects.  The colors are so saturated.  I've found that if I want a color but just not as dark, I simply apply a lighter amount & then use a blending pencil to get a nice smooth finish.  I can see where a true artist might want an even larger set of pencils.  But, if you are simply using these to color in adult coloring books, the 75ct provides plenty of variety.  Personally, I really like having the 150ct.  I have found that I really do use every single pencil.  The Marco Raffine pencils seemed fine until I bought these pencils.  I will definitely be staying with the  Prismacolor pencils.  The color is better.  They go on much more smoothly.  They even sharpen better.
UPDATE #1:  I recently purchased the 150 ct Prismacolor Premier Pencil Set.  Every now and then I run into the problem of having a pencil break.  Then, when I sharpen it, no matter how gentle I try to color with it, the pencil continues to break every time I sharpen it.  I have tried using several different manual and electric sharpeners: but, the pencil continues to break.  This has happened with dark green, pumpkin orange, and several other colors,  I don't mind spending the money on the 150 Prismacolor Premier set.  But, I am on a tight budget & have to save up to purchase this set.  I really don't appreciate throwing my money away.  I literally had a pumpkin pencil repeatedly break from brand new condition to too short for me to hold on to.  This happened in one evening.  I've purchased the 132 ct set in the past and decided to purchase the 150 ct set because I wanted the 18 colors that the 132 ct set didn't have.  I couldn't get those colors individually in my local supply store and ordering  them online was rather expensive.  The cost of the 150 ct set is so reasonable on Amazon that it made more sense for me to buy the 150 ct than to purchase those 18 individual pencils from other online sites.  They just cost so much individually that buying this 150 ct set is a no brainer.  I checked out what the missing 18 colors were and I knew that I would use all them.  I am, however, getting sick and tired of this breakage issue.  It happens far to frequently.  I previously gave Prismacolor
Pencils a 5 star rating but I changed it to a 3 star rating.  I can't give a perfect rating to a product that has such an obvious defect.
UPDATE #2:  1/27/17:  I purchased an Alvin 9866 Brass Bullet Sharpener for $8.76 on Amazon.  It's a small brass bullet sharpener with replaceable blades which I also purchased on Amazon.  The trouble I was having with pencils breaking has been solved.  This little sharpener can give the pencil an extremely sharp point which is perfect for coloring those tiny, detailed areas.  You just can't press down hard when you sharpen the pencil to that extreme a point.  If you don't need an extremely sharp point, you just don't sharpen the pencil as much.  I found some articles that recommend turning the sharpener, not the pencil.  So, that's what I do for the most part.  I've also found articles that recommend sharpening a regular lead pencil every now and then.  While this bullet sharpener doesn't have a compartment to catch the shavings, the small inconvenience of sharpening into a small plastic cup or other container & disposing of the shavings later is quite acceptable given the results it gives compared to every other sharpener I have tried.  I love the fact that I can buy replacement blades instead of having to buy a new sharpener when the blade dulls.  I still, very rarely, find a pencil that wants to keep breaking.  It's usually the pumpkin one.  So, I warm in on a heating pad.  It makes a big difference.  So, I have changed my review back to a 5 star rating.  The right sharpener makes all the difference.",3,14.559313

3817,"I bought this HP Laser Jet Pro M277dw Wireless All-in-One color laser printer to replace a Dell 1355cn -- also a color laser printer of about the same office load capacity, except the Dell does not have wi-fi capability built in.  The HP has ""AirPrint"" the Apple protocol for printing from mobile.

Note that the paper tray capacity on the HP M277dw is very small.  That works for me these days because I do very little large-batch printing.  My book manuscripts no longer go to the publisher as 3 printed copies of a 500 page manuscript, but just one electronic file.  And I don't do paper backups or print every single version of a book as I'm writing it.  I print publicity flyers, plus the usual array of office management and file backups of bills and so forth.  Likewise, correspondence is mostly electronic.  The world has changed, and printers have changed with it.

Before deciding to buy this M277dw printer, I read the array of 1-star reviews with some trepidation, but concluded that as sometimes happens, Amazon has lumped reviews of different versions of a product all with the same product number together on one page -- or some people drop their comment on the wrong page because the picture looks right.  One person regarded the upper scanning layer of the HP printer as flimsy -- on the one I got, it is sturdy.  Others indicated the printer couldn't stay connected to wi-fi and misbehaved.  On my network, (run by a 2016 ASUS router top of the line) it's solid.

So I am giving this M277dw (June 2017 purchase date) 5 stars because none of the problems others have noted turned up for me.

The printer went online, and stayed online overnight while dormant, and printed from another room (from my iPhone) without anyone going to the printer to turn it ""on.""

The print quality, in b&w and in color, exceeds my 7 year old Dell laser printer.  The speed is also a bit greater, and much-much faster than any of the 3 inkjet printers I've had from Canon and Epson.  And this HP M277 is connected only by wi-fi.

I think the secret is in having modern equipment all of the same generation.  I suspect this printer does not do as well, as easily, in an older environment than 2014.  The brochure that comes with the HP M277 has directions for earlier Windows systems, and there's an indication that Win10 might need a driver download from HP.  A disk comes with the printer to install HP's proprietary, (very useful and flexible, but complicated) software to run the printer.  The programs on that disk are available on the HP website to download and install manually.

I did none of that installing from their disk or by download.  But everything works.  If I later need to do something fancy, I may try installing their software, but without it, I have scan to computer, I have fax, and I can print from Word, a browser, or other text programs.

I am asking a lot of an out-of-the-box plug-it-in device.  It prints from iPhone, iPad, MacOS Sierra 10.12.5, and Win10 running on Parallels on the Mac but ""sharing"" the printer installed on the Mac.  I have not tried to install it on a Win7 computer yet.

The HP brochure directions indicate you should go to the App Store for Mac and download the HP ""App"" -- but on the App Store, a lot of people had posted very disappointed comments about that app in the previous few weeks, so I didn't download that app.

In other words, I didn't install the HP disk software to run the printer, and I didn't download the App for the Mac.  The rest of the directions in the brochure and on the printer's own screen, I followed exactly.

You touch the wi-fi icon, touch the name of your network when it comes up, enter your passphrase, and you are connected to all your network devices.  There are directions for connecting the printer via Mac Address.  And separate directions for ""Enterprise"" offices managed by IT professionals who have to make all the printers work together.

Then, for a Mac, you go to the devices menu for printers in ""system preferences"" and authorize the HP M277, and you're done.

Without the app and the software from HP, the only way I found (so far) of summoning the scanning software on the Mac is via the menu in ""system preferences"" using the scanner tab.  Word for Mac immediately recognizes the HP printer and offers to print to it.  No further installing required.

It comes set to print two sided, sucking the page back in to print the back.  But the print menu lets you change that.

Now ink.  The HP M277 comes with 4 ink cartridges, the 3 colors and a black, already inside the printer.  My printer got set out in the heat on its side for hours, but nothing happened to the ink.  I didn't have to take the cartridges out and remove tape or anything.  They were ready to work.  You can see the on the slide-out tray in the image I've posted here.

There are no fancy directions in the brochure about how to replace these cartridges, but there are a couple of icons that indicate not to shake the cartridges.  They are hidden behind the FRONT panel which you pull down (gently but firmly) to reveal a slide-out-tray for easy access to change the cartridges.  I haven't had to do that yet, but it looks easy compared to some printers I've owned.

I'm also showing the scanner top open so you can see the plate and the document feeder.

I'm pretty sure I will install the HP software at some point, but for most purposes in my office, this is just fine.  If you need a quick up and running printer that just works, this may be the best buy you will find.

Right now different programs on my MacOS and/or Win10 allow different options settings on this printer when you hit print.  For example, in a simple PDF produced from a Microsoft Publisher file, you can't print two sided without manually re-feeding the printed stack.  But printing from Publisher itself, you have a two-side print option.  With huge amount of color on both pages, it takes about 7 minutes to print 50 sheets two sided (100 pages).

Refilling the paper tray was followed by a paper jam - but it was easy to clear by tilting the rear tray out and pulling out the jammed page.  The rear tray opens from the top.  Graphic directions appeared in the little screen which is sharp enough to understand details of how to clear the jam.  I expect directions will appear when you need to replace ink cartridges - but have new ones standing by.

In printing 150 copies of two-sided color project, there were 3 ""jams"" -- one was an offset piece of paper in the feeder tray that caused an error message saying to open the rear drawer, but inspection found none there.  A bit of fiddling, and the printer ""reinitialized"" and went on the the print job.  After 100 copies, two sided, it is running hot, but still running.  Printing at 600dpi it is very sharp and crisp.

When I mean a lot, means a lot, I had to laminate 800 pages (menus for a restaurant) I first went to Staples to get a quote and for the whole job it came out to $600 dollars. I was left with no choice to get one, and after looking over several laminators, I thought to give it a chance to this one, and the $37 price could not be bid. I even thought to buy a second one in case this one broke after so many laminations, but not at all! The laminator heated after 3 minutes, then I started and after 4 hours and while reading a book all my 800 pages where laminated perfectly, no bubbles, no mess, no wrinkles and no jamming either.

3821,"This printer is not for you if you do a lot printing with different type of paper and different sizes (envenlope) OR switching from multipurpose tray to drawer 1. It does not auto detect or have priority. Computer settings and printer settings does not communicate well. It is so tedious to switch back and forth going through the settings. Printer is constantly beeping and not print until I cancel the job and reconfigure it to the right settings. Running back and forth to the printer is not fun.

For Example:
This printer is not capable of using the settings in a saved document file (ie. envelope template). You'll have to manually configure it each time you print one. It will not use the multipurpose tray as priority, you'll have to change the settings for that too on BOTH the COMPUTER and then confirming it on the PRINTER. You can create a profile setting for it, but it you'll still have to confirm it on the printer before it will actually print. NOT USER FRIENDLY. Now if you want to print a regular sheet of paper... You'll have to reconfigure all the settings for that, change envelope size to LTR, change multipurpose to drawer 1 or change profile settings and then pray that it doesn't beep and not print. Actually, it will beep.. and not print, you'll have to run to the printer and confirm the right type of paper before it will actually print.

This printer IS for you, if you're NOT planning on using different size paper or NOT planning on using the multipurpose tray often.

3827,"Until I purchased my Fellowes shredder a couple of years ago, I didn't even know that you needed to oil them.  It came with a small bottle of oil that actually lasted me quite a while.  But, when I was ready, I ordered this large bottle of oil and keep it in the compartment on the back of my shredder, so that it is always right there for when it is time to empty the basket and oil again.

As I mentioned, this is a LOT of oil and will last a very, very long time for home use and quite a while for office use as well.  It comes in a nice, sturdy bottle with a little stopper top that stays on perfectly fine as long as you aren't tossing the bottle around.  I like the shape of the bottle because it fits perfectly in the compartment on the back of my shredder.  If I wasn't able to keep it right there with my shredder I would probably forget to use it.

I purchased this eleven months ago and my bottle is still almost full. For six-seven dollars, it is a good deal IMO.  Maybe you could just buy a bottle of some other kind of oil, but I think it is worth those few dollars to have a bottle with the thin tip for easy application and I don't have to remember to run to the kitchen to get some oil, pour it into something that makes it easier to apply, and then have another dish to wash.

3828,"I really loved this pen when I received it as a gift. Though heavy, it writes like a dream. And really nice design.

The catch is that although it is made of durable materials, after about 2.5 years, the decorative cap on the bottom just fell off (not dropped or traumatized) and the cap seal has already worn out--it now fits loosely and the nib dries out. Parker is willing to repair it, but at more than half the cost of purchasing a new one. And in this age of the Interweb, they expect me to maintain the warranty information, and take no accountability for keeping records themselves. Not an acceptable level of service for a luxury product in the 21st century. Perhaps they could take a customer service lesson from Tumi.

For a $400 plus pen (my wife bought it at a retail shop), I expect durable, quality craftsmanship. That pen was lightly used, but had two manufacturing failures in less than three years. I also expect excellent customer service. I did not get it in this pen.

It has rubber feet prevent slipping but the plastic legs that hold the stand up are a little flimsy, which causes stand to wiggle left to right slightly. I would like if they could make it from metal with a thin rubber coating on most parts to make this a more sturdier and longer lasting stand but of course it would be a little heavier but it would be worth the longer use you would get out of it.

3833,"There's only one thing wrong with this machine.  I'll get to that in a minute.

The OfficeJet L7780 is a great all-in-one, much better than the 6100 series was.  Print quality is great, mechanical operation is acceptable, the power-saving features and wireless communication are very worthwhile.

The printer's biggest draw is an advertised per-page cost lower than a laser printer, and much lower than the single-cartridge DeskJet printers.  It's very enticing.  And it might be true -- if you ever get around to using up a whole cartridge of ink.  But before you get to that point, the printer gives an error message:  ""The following ink cartridge(s) appear to be missing or damaged.""

There's nothing wrong with your ink cartridges.  One of them has simply been in your printer longer than HP thinks it should be.  When you install a new cartridge, the printer starts a timer for that cartridge, and when the timer counts down to zero, the printer pops up the ""missing or damaged"" error message.

And it's a hard error, too.  There's no way around it, according to HP, except to replace the affected ink cartridge -- even if that cartridge is still 1/3 or 1/2 full of ink.

HP was either too clever (or too STUPID, depending on your point of view) to have the printer issue a simple warning message saying, ""The indicated cartridge has hit its shelf life limit,"" and giving you the choice to continue printing until you get around to replacing the cartridge.  And HP was just too STUPID -- and inconsiderate of users -- to give the user any advance warning:  ""The indicated cartridge will hit its shelf life limit in two days.""  No, it happens suddenly, without warning, and it locks up the entire all-in-one.

I really expected better than this from HP.  (And then there's the issue of WHY these new-and-improved inks have such a short shelf life.  Maybe HP laid off their good ink chemists and imported some cheaper ones from China.)

This problem is insidious, and it's pervasive.  It affects all HP inkjet printers.  Searching on the web turns up several workarounds, but a user SHOULD NOT have to do any of them.  Until HP releases a firmware upgrade that gets rid of this design defect, the OfficeJet L7780 gets only one star, and this is the last HP printer I will buy (I've been buying them since ThinkJet days).",20,14.234121

The gold is by far my favorite (although the pink and the purple are a pretty close second and third).  These just knock my socks off.  Couple things to be aware of, They are a bit slow in drying (as most metallic inks are) and will rub off real smooth surface (like glass) easier than a standard Sharpie type marker.  My only real complaint is that they are made in China (which is VERY clearly stated on the package), but the story on the package leads you to believe that this company is dedicated to employing domestic workers (I think they are Canadian based)so a bit of a confusing conflict (I'm sure the company does have a domestic work force- but the story just leads you to believe that the products are being made domestically).

I am so glad I went with the Fellowes 79Ci. I didn't know shredders could be this quiet. You can easily stand next to this unit and have a conversation while it is running. Also, it seems that manufacturers overstate the page capacity of these shredders. I will give Fellowes an A- for their 14 sheet rating. I just tested that claim with standard printer paper and it refused 14 pages. However, it did take 13 pages, albeit with at the RED bar rating. One of my goals was to be able to drop junk mail into the shredder without having to open it. I find that I can do that about 75% of the time without the Fellowes balking.

Glad I did.  Yes, it has the consistency of skim milk and yes, the label instructions say to press the components together for from 15 to 60 seconds; but the instructions also state that both surfaces must be dry & free of oil, soap, wax, paint, varnish, previously used cement and any other residue; AND that the repaired joint will not be fully cured for 3 to 7 days.

I repaired a valued coffee mug with a broken handle and a ceramic candle bowl that had been dropped.  I made sure that the joining surfaces were clean, applied the milky adhesive and placed both patients into separate ""grip wrench"" straps to hold them tightly together and left them untouched for several days. They were fixed, their joints are strong and hardly visible.

3848,"I've been buying Brother laser printers for years, because they're some of the best consumer/SOHO laser printers out there if you run Linux as your OS. This printer is no exception. The primary attributes are postscipt printing with the built-in BR-Script language, the ability to upgrade the memory easily and inexpensively (important for postscript printing), and the relatively low cost of toner per page. I got 10 years out of an earlier HL-660, and 5 years so far out of an HL-5150DLT. I'm hoping for equal longevity from this one.

The largest upside and the largest downside to these printers stem from the same issue: a bog-simple control panel. There are only two buttons--Job Cancel and Go--and 5 status LEDs. For most printing this is fine; you print, you grab the paper off the top of the machine, you're done. All real printer management is done from the network I/F. If you're comfortable with network management you'll be fine, but if you need a more user-friendly interface such as an LCD menu you should look elsewhere.

As with most Brother laser printers, I highly recommend you do three things as soon as you buy it:

1) upgrade the memory to the maximum possible. This will speed up print jobs significantly, particularly with postscript printing.

2) after loading paper the first time, press the 'Go' button once to print the test page, and then keep it. This allows you to evaluate the printing quality down the road as the printer ages, toner cartridges get replaced, etc.

3) after printing the test page, press the 'Go' button again 3 times quickly (within 2 seconds). This prints 3 pages of detailed printer settings, including the serial number, the network settings, the toner/fuser life remaining, etc. These can be useful for setup. After setting the printer up and getting it running, do this again, and then keep these pages. This information comes in handy down the road when you need to connect other computers, set up software, or track the wear and tear on your printer.",5,11.623343

3875,"I did not buy this printer through Amazon (although I would have saved $10 had I done so), but rather through a local warehouse club. I was dubious about my purchase based on all the poor reviews; however as all but two of the reviews were not ""verified purchases"", I did not lend them too much credence.  I know my review is not a ""verified purchase"" either, but I am a frequent Amazon purchaser & a regular reviewer who prides himself on accurate & fair reviews.

I am using this printer on a Mac running 10.10.3. I bought it to replace my HP J5750 ""All-In-One"" that suddenly decided not to print in black. As well, my old printer shook my entire computer desk while it printed, and it never printed photos worth saving. The HP 7645 prints both B&W and Color on standard paper in less than half the time and doesn't shake my desk at all. Further, it prints 4x6 and 5x7 photos quickly and beautifully on HP & Kodak glossy photo paper; every bit as good as drug store prints. The quality of B&W printing is every bit as good as a laser, crisp and very detailed, so I don't understand those reviewers who claim otherwise. As an ink jet printer it is, of course, noisier than a laser, but not so noisy as to distract.

I tried the printer first using the USB connector with excellent results. I then (and since) used it via the wireless connection which has worked flawlessly. Other users didn't mention their operating systems, so perhaps they were using one which had problems recognizing the printer, but my Mac had no issues. Print response was just  as quick as if the printer was connected via a cable.

All-in-all, I highly recommend this printer for any Mac user.

UPDATE: 04/17/15
Had an issue where the auto-document feeder wasn't working properly. Went to HP Support and did a ""Chat"" with a tech-person. Issue resolved quickly and easily. I found my tech-guy informed and cordial. 20-seconds to connect, 5-minutes to fix. I'm a happy camper ...",180,12.962916
3876,"I've always loved laser printers, spending over 10x as much as I did for this on my first one back in '95.  The quick performance, brilliant text, and consistent, reliable, and affordable results have never been matched by any other type of printer in my experience.

This one lives up to my expectations at a price (I got mine closer to $50) that greatly exceeds them.  It lacks color, which is nice to have, but it's far from a deal breaker for me.  My inkjet has color, but this entire printer with toner cost less than a partial refill on my Epson Artisan 725.

I use the network printing (via ethernet), but as this is next to one of my switches, I've yet to try WiFi.  Not having any form of display, you may need to use a USB cable and a PC to set up WiFI, but other reviews likely are more insightful.  Wired network performance (using my laptop via wireless) is outstanding, and Windows 8 installation was a breeze.  Print speed is good, and larger jobs/multiple copies really get going.  Thus far every copy is pristine with nary a displaced fleck, let alone a streak or worse.  Even the tiniest (requiring a magnifying glass) is razor sharp.

Note I bought a refurb, and other than the invoice, I couldn't tell.  Everything looked first rate and new!

3877,"I've had a love hate relationship with this thing.

I love that it reclines all the way back. I could almost use it as a bed.
I hate that there are no places to put your arms while you are fully reclined. Your arms dangle off the sides and pinch on the side wings. Cutting off blood flow. So there's no real relaxing going on there.

I love that you can rock the base of the seat or lock it in place while you keep the back in position. (Relative to the base.)
I hate that the base of the seat does not lock in any other positions other than straight. Especially at this price.
It is basically a simple spring tension you find in many cheap chairs.

I love the high back and both pillows it comes with.
Hate that there's no adjustable headrest. Even my real car seat has that.

I love the adjustable option to the arms.
I hate that they're hard rubber and thin. And you can't use them if you lay back at any reasonable angle for relaxing.
I think that's the case on all of these chairs.

Love the soft foam in the base of the seat.
Hate the wings on the sides of the base. You sit straight legged or nothing at all. Because those wings have a hard metal pipe running through them. And why? It's not like you're driving your desk at 100 mph and you're about to fly out of it. Give us some leg room over that nonsense.

In the end I thought about returning it. Technically I am at the max the chair says it's suited for. But all other chairs have the same winged sides on the base that cut off blood flow if you dare to sit like a man.

But instead of returning it, I tried a few things.
I first got a ""Mobo Chair Mount"" for the arms. Turned the hard rubber thin knife edges into something useful. It mounts well to the chair.

I then got a ""TravelMate Coccyx Orthopedic Gel-enhanced Comfort Foam Seat Cushion""
I placed that in the seat and it just barely fits once you let it form. I can still feel the wing edges and the pipe in it but it's managable with a 3 inch height to the cushion.

Update: The base for the caster wheels has bowed in the middle and the center now sits on the floor. I'm 180lbs.

3886,"When All-In-One printers with 4-5 star ratings are costing between $60-$80, my first question is if this printer will give what I need to justify paying an additional $20-$50?

- Wireless setup was a snap!
More and more of my devices are moving to wireless and the fact that this comes stock with a wireless adapter and the setup was easy was a huge bonus. I have a Canon printer, where the wireless troubleshooting guide is twice the size as the printer's manual. That should tell you something!

- Color printing looks great!
I do a lot of presentations and having the ability to punch out a flyer or preso in color that looks crisp and clean is a great bonus.

- Color PHOTO printing was impressive!
Too many times I have a printer where I need to tweak the color settings or find just the right kind of photo paper. I tired two brands of photo paper and this worked out very nicely out of the box.

- Ink costs are high!
Because of ink cost is how ALL the printer companies get you...sell the printer cheap and they charge you more over time for the ink. It would just be nice to get a named brand printer ink at affordable prices, without having to go to some backdoor, knock-off brand.

- One cartridge out = no printing!
I ran out of the blue and it wouldn't even let me select to only print greyscale. Thus I'm forced to replace the cartridge (see previous comment on ink cost). That's bogus!

- All-in-one printer with duplex printing, oh yeah!
For me this is what makes the cost more worthwhile. Saving paper and getting the ability to duplex is worth the extra cost.

- Scanning works fine.
 Honestly I don't use this feature as much as I should because I copy more. But my test provided easy scans that I could later email to someone. The best part of the scanning is that its fast.

- Copying quality is nice.
My wife copies a lot out of our home office and when you need to run an additional page off, the copy speed was fast and the quality was very satisfactory.

OVERALL:

3895,"I bought mine online shortly after it was released. the reviews were great. I was drawn in by the folding (size for storage), the rotary blade system, the LED, the good reviews that described a feature packed trimmer that would meet my long-term needs.  I paid extra to have an excellent tool.... Or so I thought.  I had such hopes for this one!  Bought specialty blades (curvy, slotted, etc)

On one axis, you have a ruler with good markings.  The cut rail for the other axis does not have any markings.  So you better be cutting something that is even inches since the printed grid shows only inch lines horizontally.  I recently had to put a ""slice"" in a 12"" paper that had to begin at 1 3/4"" and end at 7 5/8"" and it was very difficult since there are no markings that allow such a function.  No metric measurements anywhere on the trimmer so skip those projects.

The blades skip (have tried new blades, the ""better titanium"" blades and even other brands. I don't have this problem with my other rotary blade cutters, only this trimmer. Was sure that once the white bar under the blade was broken in a bit, there would be no problem, but was wrong. Can't find resolution to this problem.

This trimmer promised ability to cut many layers. Double layer usually cuts better than single layer, but more than two doesn't give good results even when I stand over the trimmer and bear down. Random skipped areas require scissors to snip..

LED track lighting is a gimmick and does not make it easier to see where you are cutting.

The feet are secure and non skid, nice and big. Well done. However, have had issues with a support foot falling out.

3905,"All our hobbies seem to have one thing in common: We cut up large objects into smaller ones, then rearrange the pieces into larger items in as decorous a fashion as possible. That is, we do quilting, woodworking, stained and fused glass. It's somehow amazing that we've never gotten into scrap booking, but there's plenty of paper to cut up in the house: photos we print, newsletters we publish, and so on.

As a result, when Amazon Vine offered me this high-tech paper trimmer, I couldn't say No. I'm glad I didn't pretend to resist -- this is a good gizmo, and the techie feature really is an enhancement.

I have an old-style paper trimmer that I bought at an office supply store 25 years ago. It still works just fine, but it's big, heavy, and clunky and the blade is a little bit scary. As a result it is usually stored on a high shelf, and I rarely climb up to get it. Unless it's a big project, I just grab a good pair of scissors. Perhaps that's what you're picturing for ""paper cutter,"" too. Don't. This is quite different.

The Fiskar's trimmer is sturdy enough for most office duty, but light and small enough to set on a shelf. Instead of the big scary guillotine, it uses a built-in rotary cutter that slides down a track; you'd have to work pretty hard to hurt yourself. You line up the paper -- the package says it'll do 12 sheets at a time -- against the edge of the unit, and slide it under a clear plastic bar. You position the paper the way you want it, then roll the cutter from top to bottom (or vice versa).

Positioning the paper is always a bit of a finicky job, and that's where the nifty feature comes in. If you slap in the three (included) batteries and turn the unit on, the Fiskar's trimmer shines a light along the cutting line. It illuminates the exact spot where the cutter will go, but somehow doesn't glare at all. The result: I think it'd be impossible to cut in the wrong place.

One thing I appreciate is that you don't HAVE to turn the unit on to cut paper; the rotary cutter works just fine without it, though obviously without the light. (I don't know about you, but infrequently-used devices always seem to have dead batteries when I want to use them. If it were for two or three photos, I'd be glad that I didn't have to search through the Drawer of Doom to find more batteries.)

Because it uses a rotary cutter, it should be possible to replace the blade, though I haven't tried to take the unit apart. The blades are cheap, too; if you can't find them on Amazon, check your local quilting store. (Fiskar's is a top brand among sewing folks.)

I experimented with more than paper. In particular, I was curious if it'd be a useful tool for quilting, since I could presumably cut, say, 4"" lengths of fabric using this solidly-mounted rotary cutter, or cut triangles precisely in half. It did okay, but only because I already had this trimmer handy; don't go out of your way to acquire one for the purpose. I also had a stack of wood veneer sitting nearby, and idly wondered if it could slice through that for an inlay project. Nope; don't even try that.

If you have a stack of paper that needs to be cut precisely, this is a really useful paper trimmer. I think it's a bit pricey, but it's certainly built to last.",7,14.503023

I chose this one out of Canon's new Maxify lineup as it's specifications met our needs.

This is a fairly new printer by Canon.

We've had this printer for about a week and couldn't be happier. I've printed photos on Pro-Luster paper that looked fine for an All-In-One printer. All document printing has been fast and clear.

I consider myself very tech savvy. Setting the printer up took maybe 30 minutes, at a relaxed pace. We have a land line running into the printer and back out into a phone so that we can receive and send faxes. The printer is currently functioning as a network printer via Ethernet connection. Setup was a breeze and everything just worked fine. The setup software recognized the printer without trouble, even though it was working through the network rather than being connected directly to the computer. Printing from multiple computers in our house is no problem, but they do each require the printer's drivers be installed.

For the price it's great. I found all the menu options on the touch screen to work well and every function of the printer is intuitive and works great.

2 paper trays hold roughly 250 sheets each, when you close a tray it asks you what paper you have installed into that tray and provides a list of options.

For one thing, there is a lot on the line. A good pencil can cost $1.75-$2, so a broken point from a failed sharpening is real money. Over sharpening, where the sharpener eats the pencil down to notiohng is just as bad. And so began my quest.

Moreover, working in the field, which is my preferred venue, requires a handheld sharpener (or an extremely long extension cord). The world of electric pencil sharpeners is bad, but nowhere near as bad as that for handhelds.

This realization came as a revelation to me. Like many people, I thought  all sharpeners are the same. The technology of handheld sharpeners is absurdly simple, a plastic cone tangent to a razor blade. So how could there be differences? I soon realized that there were. The manufacturing tolerance of the cone matters, but, more importantly, the quality and positioning of the blade matters even more.

Initially, I thought battery powered devices were the solution. For most of these devices, the technology is identical, a rotating razor blade powered by batteries, as are the results. I used a Foray brand handheld, reputed to be an excellent device, but awful for me. I also used a not of other no name with equally bad results.

To be clear, there are three kinds of bad results possible. First, the blade simply does not sharpen sufficiently. About 20% of the sharpeners I tried failed this simple test. Either the blade was insufficiently sharp or the come was incorrectly formed. The second major problem is breakage. This is the worst outcome--putting a dilly colored pencil into the sharpener only to have it turn the dull point into a broken point--a complete disaster requiring the reshape ink of the pencil and the loss of about one sixteenth or more of the pigment.  The third problem is oversharpening. Sme sharpeners tend t sheer off a portion of the point, leaving it extremely sharp and extremely fragile. This is also no good since using the pencil with any pressure (unavoidable in colored pencil drawing) leads to a catastrophic breakdown.

Enter the Staedtler. It is solidly built with surprising heft. There are two holes, producing points of differing slope. One hole, labeled graphite, produces the familiar 23* slope point. The other, labeled color and graphite, produces a fatter 30* slope point. The latter is advantageous for colored pencils since the resulting fatter point is more resistant to breakage. Sharpening blunt pencils (I have yet to try it with unsharpened pencils) is a breeze. The graphite slot fits the pencil like a glove. A few turns, much fewer than with other sharpeners, produces a super sharp, perfectly symmetric point. The color slot has some play in it since it can be used by thicker pencils as well. Despite this, it too sharpens with few turns and no particular effort. The result  is a super sharp, super robust wide point. After sharpening about 15 dull colored  pencils, I suffered zero problems. Sharpening about 10 graphite pencils yielded the same results.

Simply put, this is easily the best sharpener I own and, more importantly, the best I have ever used out of a sample of about 20+ sharpener models. Especially if you are a colored or art pencil user, this is the one to buy. It will pay for itself in terms of reducing pencil wastage in shirt order. You cannot do better.",9,14.662

3918,"I bought this phone for my mother who is 87 years old. She really liked the amber-colored display, but it is not as easy to read as standard black type on a grey-white background. The instructions that come with the phone are an ""abridged edition,"" so to discover how to fully operate the phone you are referred to AT&T's web site for further information. You can get by with the printed set of instructions. However, this ""BIG BUTTON"" phone could be more simple to operate.

For instance: if you want to lower the ringer volume at night, you must do so each night, then go through the same procedure each morning to set the ringer level back up. This requires several steps. This is not an uncomplicated and very easy to use device. I tried -- many times -- to record a clear greeting for the answering function, but the message comes out rather ""fuzzy"" and not easy to understand -- at least that what it sounds like when you playback the message or when the answering function handles a call.

Her previous AT&T phone was a simpler, basic phone similar to this one in the color black, which somehow showed up dings more easily; sort of a cheap look after a short while. I didn't appreciate the ugly greenish color back-lighting of the display screen making it difficult to view nor the poor quality speaker functionality.

3922,"I am making a nine patch quilt using 1 inch finshed little patches & matching the seams was a nightmare until I ordered these fork pins. Now my seams all match & it is really a blessing to see my quilt turning out so crisp & professional, compared to my first nine patch blocks in the quilt.

Basically what you do is butt up the 2 seams, place a fork pin so that the seam is held together on each side by the 2 prongs of the pin. SLOWLY crawl over these pins with your needle, do each stitch turning your machine wheel until you have safely crawled over the pins. I was always afraid to sew over pins, but if you absolutely go slowly, you will not break a needle & you will end up with a perfectly matched set of seams using the fork pins.

Don't get in a hurry to get over those pins, you will save tons of time in the long run by not having to stop & rip out a seam that you thought should absolutely have matched up but did not. Oh yes, they lay flat & are very easy to insert in fabric.

I found about about these pins by googling on the net for directions on how to get perfect matching seams & several people mentioned these Clover fork pins. I am going to order another box of pins as soons as I get together a 25.00 free shipping order. Wish I had ordered 2 boxes right off the bat.

I use 100 per cent cotton quilting fabric & have noticed these pins leave little holes, but after pressing my finished block, the holes have healed themselves & disappeared. I cannot say if these pins would work for other types of material. The little holes are absolutely no problem & I don't feel they damage the material in any way since they disappear. I have checked back at previous blocks to see if the holes reappeared, but I cannot find a single trace of where the pins were.

If you are a quilter, please treat yourselves to a wonderful tool. These are not some gimmick things that pop up on the quilting market to take your money & you end up tossing the gadget since it sorta kinda aorked but really wasn't worth the hassel of using.

Also, I ordered a large box of binding clips to hold my quilt binding onto a quilt.

3924,"I'm willing to give new seating technologies a chance, but as a long-time (as in, more than a decade) Aeron user, I keep coming across a big omission in reviews of new designs like Herman Miller's Embody or Steelcase's Gesture: the 10-hour numb-butt endurance test.

The typical office chair reviewer seems to spend a couple of hours fiddling with adjustments and experimenting with different seating positions. All well and good, but the only way to really know if a chair works for you is to live with it over a typical (for you) work week.

I suspect you will find that for all their glitzy features, the weak point of the Gesture and the Embody will be their seat cushions. By its nature, a cushion will deform to accommodate the points where your body weight is concentrated, around your pelvic bones. Over a couple of hours, these pressure points will start to hurt, and you will fidget in a subconscious attempt to shift cushion support to other regions of your backside. Susceptibility to ""hot spots"" is the fundamental weak point of any cushioned seat, no matter how soft or firm or what exotic materials it's made from.

The Aeron's seat is actually a hammock of springy, ventilated mesh fibre. It ""floats"" independent from the setback. You don't sit ON this hammock as you would a cushion, you sit IN it. The hammock envelopes your tush as a net does a fish: Your body weight is distributed evenly across the entire seating area. The result is no pressure points, no hot spots, no numb-butt, and no fidgeting.

My Aeron has served me faithfully over more than a decade of 10-hour days at my home-office workstation. It is the best investment in office furniture I have made in my 30-odd year career as a technical writer.

From my recollection of previous chairs, where I'd be squirming within 90 minutes, I do not hesitate to assert the Aeron has significantly and consistently enhanced my productivity. Perhaps these new-tech chairs would do the same, but their conventional seat cushions make me leery.

The only way to know for sure whether one of them works for you would be to put each of them through a typical work week.

I'm not shopping for a chair so am not motivated to do that. But if you are, you should. Because if you are a knowledge worker, the right office chair can improve the quality of your work. And, more than you might imagine, the quality of your life.",3,14.129086

3927,"*Edit: I knocked off a star after a few months of use. Details at the bottom.

Okay, I have to set my situation up, because *how* you use this pen will determine if it's good for you.

I have large hands (well, slightly-larger-than-normal hands for a 6'1"" guy, but huge compared to, say, my average-sized girlfriend). I have to keep a pen in my pant pocket while I'm working and take it out and put it back constantly. I also end up having to write at weird angles during my shift, often at a moment's notice.

Now that you know all this, the pen performs beautifully for me. It's thick, so it fits more comfortably in my hand. Since the pen is retractable, I don't waste time with an all-to-easy-to-lose pen cap, and the fact that the clip actually retracts the tip means I'm far less likely to throw the pen with the tip still out in my pocket (FYI, the button on top will only bring the tip out). Finally, the pressurized ink means that the pen is always ready to go and will not run dry when I'm writing on paper I'm holding against a vertical wall.

Now, if your situation is more run-of-the-mill, this might not be the best choice for you. I could see someone with small hands having trouble manipulating it, but the real issue is cost: for the price of one Down Force you could get a whole box of generic pens. So whether or not it's worth it depends completely on how you're going to use it.

EDIT 1/8/2014: So I liked this pen enough that a bought a second one and extra refills. After about four months of use, though, I noticed both pens developed the same problem: the clip, after being opened and closed constantly (since that's how you extend and retract the tip), would develop a crack halfway down. This causes the clip to bend under pressure - which means anytime you're not holding it open, since there's a spring holding it against the pen barrel. This, in turn, means that the tip will no longer lock in the down position, since the way it locks is by catching the clip (which is now bent).

If the clip is still attached to the pen, you can still get it to lock by using some fancy fingerwork (hold down the part of the clip with the catch while simultaneously pushing the other end down as if you were opening it - this straightens it - *and* pushing the button to extend the tip), which will ultimately make the clip break sooner because of the extra pressure you're now exerting. Once the clip breaks off entirely, the pen is unusable.

I should also not that this could be easily solved by Pilot using a thicker plastic, or possibly metal, for the clip.",2,8.33008
3928,"This is my third epson scanner and I have been more than pleased with all of them. I prefer the front opening to this side opening scanner as I am usually scanning multiple small items and it is easier to position them in place as I sit at my desk when the lids lifts up instead of to the side. On the positive side the scanner is very fast and the software program it comes with is pretty straightforward and does an excellent job of finishing the little details as straightening and enhancing colors or cropping the scanned items. Also prints easily.

Love the off and on button as sometimes I do forget to unplug the scanner when not in use and this eliminates that concern. It was very easy to set up with Windows 7, even though that is not one of those mentioned in the material that came with it. It is necessary to go to the Epson web site for the drivers but that was no problem.

Since I have had previous epson scanners I tended to think I knew exactly how to make them work. That was true to a certain extent but I think if I take the time to read the online guides and installed instructions, it would make some of the advanced features of the software and smart panel more usable. I believe a few of the hassles I have experienced are more a part of the way in which Media Expessions (accompanying software) functions that the scanner itself and I learned that by going directly to control panel and locating printers and other devices and scanning directly from them, it was much easier for oversize paper that I needed  to stitch together with the photo stitch program then using the Media Expressions software. My scanned items go to a file on my computer and I don't really scan to email, printer or pdf that often so have not used the available scanner buttons beside the on/off.

3929,"I own an Epson XP-300 All-In-One printer. I purchased this printer a couple years ago, and while not overly impressed with the image quality it produced, I was satisfied it was fair for the price. I mainly needed it for document printing and scanning, anyway. It handled both of these functions as expected. Until the first time it ran out of black ink.
In the past, I have owned color printers which offered a feature that allowed you to continue printing black and white documents in a sort of brown shade created by combining the color ink when the black ink ran out. The Epson XP-300 does not offer this option. When the black ink runs dry, you cant print. I found this to be an annoyance, and certainly a disappointment, but I didn't feel the need to replace the printer because of it. I found a workaround, printed in blue.
I replaced the black ink cartridge maybe a week later. I bought a twopack of new Epson 200XL cartridges in black. The first new cartridge did not work. I did all the troubleshooting, nothing. The printer was functioning, but no black ink was flowing. So I tried the second new cartridge. Also a dud. At this point I was certain I had to be doing something wrong, because what were the chances of two cartridges being dry? I called support, did all the troubleshooting again. Nope. So, I went back to the store, bought a third 200XL cartridge, returned home, inserted it, and EUREKA! I had black ink again! However, somehow in all the troubleshooting I screwed up something on the printer, and my printer was suddenly producing a fuzzy line every few lines of print. I have to this day been unable to correct it, and it has ruined my ability to print photos. Oh well, I could print documents again, and that was the important thing. Although, I had certainly spent a lot of money to have the option to print photos.
Today, July 30th, 2015 I needed to print a job application which must be signed by hand. So, I attempted to print the black and white document. I knew that I had been running low on both the magenta and cyan ink levels for a while, but today I simply wanted to print in black, which I still have plenty of. I downloaded the document, I selected to print it, hit print And I received a notification that I needed to replace an ink cartridge. Magenta finally ran out. A helpful little Would you like to reorder now? option popped up from Epson, and I asked it to remind me later. I then proceeded to search for an option to print in black only. I selected black and grayscale from the printer options menu, hit print again, and was again notified that I needed to replace the empty MAGENTA ink cartridge. So I searched again for a workaround, as every printer I have ever used in the history of color printing has allowed the option to print only in black if a color cartridge ran dry, but there was no workaround. Nothing. I mentioned before that I was once able to print in blue when the black ran out, but that work around no longer worked, either. I am guessing Epson discovered this little cheat, and one of the numerous updates Epson has pushed took care of it.
I am not currently in a financial position to replace ink cartridges, I do not even have the gas to spare to drive into town to print at the library. So, I called Epson technical support. My call, even though it was dialed to a U.S. number (562-276-4382) was routed to the Philippines. I spoke with a technician who insisted on repeating that Epson printers will not print if any of the four cartridges run dry until I asked to be transferred to a supervisor. The supervisor also insisted on repeating this useless bit of information until I asked to speak with someone capable of listening to and understanding what I was saying  which was, in a nutshell, this: I understand that this printer is not going to print until I replace the cartridge, however nowhere in any of the reading material that came with the printer was it described that this would be an issue. If it had been, I would not have purchased this printer as I expect that a printer should be able to complete its most basic function  print a black and white document  so long as black ink is available, and I would have instead went with a product that would meet that expectation. So now I have a printer that will not do what I had every reason to expect it would do, and I do not want it anymore. I spent my money that I earned on this product and I have a right to satisfaction. How will Epson make this right?
The supervisor transferred me to a customer support specialist, who happened to actually be located in the states, and he reiterated the products shortcomings, and apologized that I was dissatisfied. He claims he has filed a report detailing my complaints, and offered me a discount should I choose to order the ink cartridges from Epson. I explained, again, that I have NO MEANS OF PURCHASING REPLACMENT CARTRIDGES, I explained again that the printers inability to actually print makes it useless to me and that I would not have purchased it had I known that it would not print in black when a color cartridge ran out. I also explained the issues that resulted from my first experience replacing ink cartridges, and his response was this  Epsons website has an FAQ section that explains this bizarre printer feature. Not the product description, the FAQ section. As in Frequently Asked Questions. As in, customers who bought this product had to ask, frequently, why the printer would not print, because they expected that it should and there was no explanation of this feature in the product manual.
I will not be able to recoup my financial loss purchasing this useless item. I can, however, make sure that anyone who takes a moment to research Epson products before making a purchase is made aware of this feature. I will not purchase Epson again.",96,13.503668
3930,"Update - just by accident I found out the problem with the Canon onetouch software not working was due to that crappy ECopy PDF pro software that is bundled on the driver disc - it is terrible and I even had a difficult time uninstalling it because it runs all these background processes that jam everything up (and I had to reinstall the scanner drivers after I uninstalled ecopy for some reason). I don't know why they bundled this software with it, as it really is badly behaving software - installing search filters and trying to take over browser plug-ins and even a registry hook - basically this behaves like malware.
  Do yourself a favor and save yourself some time and frustration and skip the installation of that.  If you need PDF editing software, I recommend going ahead and spending a few dollars to get something decent. We like Foxit Phantom PDF and it is reasonably priced for a PDF editor.  Once I uninstalled ecopy pro then the scanner behaves much better and I can rate it 4 stars instead of the original 3.

Man - for the price of this scanner, I expected to be able to just install the software and go - NOPE.  On both of my laptops running windows 8.1 I can scan fine using wia and twain with other software but for some reason Canon's own onetouch software which is supposed to launch and scan when you press the start button can't seem to communicate with the scanner. I updated all the software and still no go. I'll keep trying, but this is just really disappointing that I can get it to scan using other software but not Canons own software.  Another disappointment is that it is not a network scanner - sure using usb makes it transfer to pc faster, but we are all using laptops and so it would really be nice to not have to plug the scanner into the laptop every time we want to use it.

 However as far as just scanning goes, this scanner is so fast it's ridiculous. You can scan multiple pages both sides in one pass faster than other scanners could even feed a single jammed sheet out. If you want a faster scanner, I'd be surprised if you could find one faster than this.

Pros - super fast scanning and decent software included

3941,"Throughout my years at work, I have always seen that the staplers on everyone's desk were made by Swingline.  It's not really something you think about, but when you need a stapler for home use, it's something that comes to mind.  This Swingline 3-in-1 Stapler Set is really nice, and the stapler even seems a little more stylish, if that's possible for a stapler.  I really like the fact that this is made as a set with not only the stapler, but also a staple puller, plus a box of 1250 staples.  We actually use a stapler at home more often than people might realize, especially when you have kids in school.  There is always a project that needs done where you could staple something instead of using glue or some other adhesive material.  Another great feather of this Swingline stapler is that they have made it with an antimicrobial material to repel bacteria, which is especially great with those kids in school.  The stapler is also very durable, and you can staple quite a few sheets of paper at once.  It's a great product.  I purchased this product at a discounted price for testing purposes and for my honest review.",2,6.9551487

Problems: worst of all, inkjet printing takes half an hour to dry -- and even then can be smudged.  Also the labels are translucent, not opaque.  And the backing has no logo or imprint -- so you can't tell front from back when putting it into the printer.  A low price is one thing.  But misleading representation has no place on Amazon.

3946,"When I got this, I had my aging in-laws in mind, but the product is great for anyone, providing you don't mind one of the two phones being corded.

The base has an answering machine and a corded handset.  The LCD screen is easy to read and, when someone calls, the Caller ID name and number show up, but the phone actually announces--quite clearly and using a female voice--the caller ID information.  If you use an answering service through your phone company, bypassing the phone's answering machine is a snap.  (There's a button on the lower right-hand side of the base unit that you push in.)  And programming the base's four big buttons with frequently-called or emergency numbers (and names) is rather a breeze, too.

The cordless handset is also quite nice, with clear reception and an easy-to-read display.

There's also an intercom-type feature, where one of the CareLine phones can call another (and the pendant can do this, too).  It would be nice if you could simply use the system like a squawk box, where you hit a button on the phone, talk and have sound come out of another phone, but instead someone actually has to answer the other phone.

The only true negative--and it's a small one--is the functionality of the CareLine safety pendant, which an elderly person (or anyone, really) could hang around his or her neck at all times.  The commands you can give it are few and are akin to: ""What time is it?""; ""What date is it?"";  ""Call all intercoms."";  ""Call number 1.""  However, the result is like having a conversation with Apple's Siri, with a whole string of ""I'm sorry.  What was that again?"" responses, with the user having a strong urge to hurl the safety pendant across the room.  There are, however, two buttons (not four) on it that will call the number 1 and 2 contact numbers corresponding to the base unit buttons.  But you never need to use the safety pendant if you don't want to.

All in all, I liked the product quite a bit and my in-laws did, too.",9,8.7226095

This, does not happen with the ordinary BIC Round stic. And that's why I prefer it.

All in all, I believe BIC pen products are the best out there.  I've tried others (like PAPER-MATE), but, then again, who hasn't? It really comes down to a matter of preference. But, this one is a definite recommend.",2,4.971454
3948,"Some major problems hurt this product.

1:  A giant gap in the middle of the inside sleeves is caused by the need to rivet those sleeves to the cover.  This causes warped sleeves and eventually warped photos on the side that's not flat to a surface.

2:  The sleeves are sometimes impossible to get photos in without bending said photos.  This is due to the side load design of the sleeves (instead of top), the fact they are open on the inner side meaning its hard to access, and because it would appear that sometimes they are not cut the same.

2b:  The bottom group of sleeves on mine was noticeably cut differently then the top bunch and its opening sat closer to the binding making it basically impossible to put in the photos.  I am going to be returning the product due to this reason.

3:  This is less of a problem and more of a warning.  When this album says 2x3... it means 2x3, and maybe even a tiny bit smaller.  The insides of the sleeves hold a 2x3 photo but it takes some work to get it in.  Its TIGHT and hard to slide them in or out, and thats if your photo is EXACTLY 2x3.  If your photo is even a millimeter bigger then 2x3, it won't fit.  So just be wary of how big the photos are cut.  Even if they are advertised as 2x3, it could be a tiny bit bigger just due to how the cut was made and then it won't fit.

All in all I was expecting more.  Unfortunately this is the ONLY 2x3 photo album I have been able to find that's not a sticker kind, or not a 2.5x3.5 misrepresented as 2x3.  Its a bit disappointing that a company is not making a nice sleeve 2x3 wallet photo album that does not have a ton of problems.  All they would need to do on this product is change the sleeve loading style from side to top, and change how the sleeves are attached (not round rivets) so that the middle gap is closed, and it would be perfect.  I would of given it 2 stars but the fact the sleeves are seemingly miss-cut on mine and I have to return it drop it to 1.",6,11.560325
3949,"Okay, when I ordered this item from Amazon, in my history it still shows I bought from WAYLEE HOLDINGS LIMITED. Now the product comes from Inktoner Plus. Another review mentions Databazzar. So we're all reviewing different products and no review can be trusted as belonging to this company's product because they've apparently all been sold under the same SKU. What's the point? Why make a review at all? Nobody, not even ourselves, know what we are talking about or where the good stuff and bad stuff comes from.

Well I bought from Waylee Holdings Limited. My first cartridge leaked all over the inside of my printer. I removed it immediately and exchanged it. My second cartridge started out fine, but in two months began leaking toner inside my printer. I put up with it, periodically removing the cartridge and cleaning up. As I go on and on the problem is worsening to the point that it just isn't worth the risk of permanent machine damage.

3951,"This is a nice scanner to take with you when you take your laptop. It is small enough to fit in a backpack or a laptop case, but still substantial and well built. The single cord USB connection is a big advantage.

While it doesn't take up much space in your backpack, you will need up to 2 feet of clear desk space to use this. That's because it has a straight through paper path. If you're scanning full-size sheets you'll need space on both the feed side and the output side. Unlike some portable scanners, this one comes with paper guides on the input side which is a big help in getting a straight scan. The downside of these guides is they are a bit fiddly to get in place and are not very long. If you are scanning full-size sheets you will still need to support the paper going in. Likewise, you need an equal space on the output side of the scanner to ensure a smooth complete scan. A 90 deg paper path, rather than the straight 180 deg path would have been better.

If you have ""autostart"" disabled on your computer this unit is not quite plug-and-play. In this case, once the scanner is plugged in and recognized by the computer, you have to browse to the scanner in Windows Explorer and double click on the .exe file before using the scanner.

Everything is scanned so far as been acceptable. The on board software has worked so well I haven't even installed the software from the included CD yet. When I do I'll report back.

Overall, this is a nice scanner. It scans well and is well-made, despite a couple of drawbacks. While it won't replace my ScanSnap S1500 for desktop use, it's a good alternative for scanning on the go.",4,8.153282

It is a heavy duty frame and holds my weight on the first step. It's the second step I'm worried about. I noticed that there is a sturdy, thick, wide metal hook that holds the top step in place when it's open. The only problem is that the hook passes through the frame and is held in place by a hard plastic cap piece! I'm like - what tha? If that cracks or snaps off when I'm on that step, the hook will slide through the hole in the frame and I'll go flying. I trust the metal to hold me but not the plastic piece.

However, the main problem I have is that you can't use it on linoleum. It slides around like its on ice. Slippery as glass comes to mind. I bought this to use mainly in the kitchen. I couldn't believe it. I could use this to curl with! The footing is plastic, not rubber. I might be able to replace the 2 front ones - don't know if they come off. But the back bottom frame is one rounded piece with these plastic pieces attached covering the bends. Look closely at the picture. Ridiculous! Why not use rubber that would grip? To save a buck or two? Even typing this makes me mad. Guess I'll have to buy a safety mat to use under this in the kitchen. Just great.

3981,"""Everything it does, it does well.""-The Samsung marketing department tag line.

 But it doesn't.

Now the copy quality and colors are excellent. This is one of the major reasons you buy a color laser printer after all. But let's face it, the same can be said of any number of color laser printers. What differentiates printers these days is ease of connection over wireless networks. This printer fails.

To connect over a WiFi network, you must push two buttons-one of the printer and one on the router. This means you cannot have the router in one room and the printer in another, unless you have a faithful assistant to punch at your command. The directions on how to accomplish this are confusing as well. And what if your router or office network do not have a button to push? Well, you know the answer, your printer will be powered like mine off a USB cable.

The second major problem is what I call the cheap problem. The initial toner is inadequate. To read the directions you get 2500 pages per cartridge. We got more like 600 before having to buy a hard to find $80 toner cartridge. Here is a tip, Samsung, this isn't an $80 ink jet. Ship this printer with the real thing.

When it comes to maintaining and gaining new math skills, Learning Resources makes so many wonderful options that is can be hard to choose!  We love the Make A Splash math mat because it can be used in so many different ways and is able to accommodate many levels of math skills.  The math mat comes with instructions for seven different math-focused activities that can be done alone, in pairs or in small groups.  I like that the girls can be self-starters on with this and work on their math skills together, or with me working with them to further grow their skills.  This set comes with More/less frames that help children physically visualize number paths so you can talk through if numbers are more or less than the initial number.

One of the games we liked the most for improving math skills was the Undersea Calculations.  In this game, you roll two of the inflatable dice (included) to create a two-digit number (for example 14), then you roll the more/less dice so that children learn how numbers relate.  If they get the +10 roll, then they would need to find the number 24.  The More/less frame helps them check their answers.

 I love how versatile it is for introducing different math skills to the girls and even their friends have fun coming over to play this game.

My wife works full-time at home for a F500 company & is on the laptop 8+ hours/day. After we got used to the movements & played around with various settings, we zeroed in on the ideal levels for a couple of different chairs.
We used colored tape to mark them - would be a nice improvement to build that ability in.

Especially since none of the job cards but two were even usable.  so I had to make up my own at the expense of twenty dollars of ink.  then I had to make the hands as the hand perforations were lousy and after ripping the first couple from having to fight with the angles forever decided it was not worth it.  so I paid a good deal of money over all and ended up having to create the whole thing from scratch other than the actual posting cloth.

3996,"I'm not going to repeat what everyone else has said,  but want add to the good reviews.  I bought this after having had a Brother multi-function laser printer which lasted for 12 good years of regular use.  Along the way, I got mid-price color printers from Lexmark and Epson, which were fine, but did not have the quality or lasting power of my Brother machine (One exception: my portable Canon, which was expensive, but is exquisite) . When the time came to replace the old MFC, I came to this.  The price is great, the quality is great, and I keep discovering new functionality.

Small caveats:

-- On normal mode, it's a little slow, but there's a fast mode which I haven't tried.
-- The scanner works wonderfully, but it is not professional level for photos. (OK, so maybe it was wishful thinking to hope for that --that's why one buys pro-level equipment.  But, as I occasionally need high quality photo scanning, just not enough to warrant the expense, I was hoping for a little better.  From reviews I'd read prior to purchase, I thought this machine would offer that level of scanning.  It's quite good--but a professional will notice some loss of nuance in depth of field and contrast).",3,9.572335
3997,"Based on reviews I bought this printer.  I hooked it up using WiFi and my Mac had no issues.  Tried to get my Windows XP laptop connected and no way.  Canon does not provide actual software like HP to load on each PC.  It assumes if connected to WiFi it will auto load from the printer built in software.  The functions like printing, scan and copy work well on my Mac.  I was disappointed not being able to get it to work on my XP machine so I returned the unit.",4,3.9128673
3998,"I needed to replace an older HP all in one office machine and I read about the new ones til I was tired of doing so and finally pulled the trigger.

Scanning is fast and high quality, printing is quiet yet fast, yet crisp (almost laser-like, but you'd have to stick your eyeball right up to the letters to see otherwise).  Images are surprisingly good.  I didn't fully understand just how good of a printer this is until I printed on a semi-gloss heavy weight DVD cover a few weeks ago.  I was stunned when it came out.  That came from MY printer??  RAZOR sharp text.  I'm convinced no laser printer could get it this good, especially not in full color.

Despite reading to the contrary in some places, this printer does not burn through ink.  I've had printers that do, and this is no where close.  It really is an efficient machine.

The touch screen responds to my fingers quickly and without having to jab at it.  The menu layout is VERY easy to navigate.  It has a beep sound with each press, but it can be turned off.

I LOVE having 2 paper cartridges.  It pulls from the second tray when the first is empty.  I actually didn't know that until it came up empty and I went looking at both of them and realized they were BOTH empty!

Ink replacement is simple and straightforward.  Open, replace, close.  Period.

The auto document feeder works like a champ!  No double or triple pulled pages.  Just one page at a time every time (except once when I unknowingly had a leading edge wrinkled document in the mix).  I've had two paper jams (both with wrinkled media) and they were very easy to clear and continue with the print job.

Scanning options are almost limitless.  Scan to pc, scan to pc with pdf, scan to email, etc.  Awesome!  The two sided scanning works well.

The wireless feature is probably the best part of this machine.  My ipad and iphones both see this printer on the wireless network and printing to it yields an instantaneous response.  I remain impressed.

I have not used the memory card slot so I cannot comment on this, nor have I ever faxed anything with it (I don't have a phone line).  I do scan documents to send to government agencies from time to time, and I've never had a document that was unreadable from my scanner (make sure you set your options!).  I also have not used  the pictbridge.

My wife commented that this printer's carriage does not shake the entire desk as it zips back and forth quietly inside.

4000,"This is a nice, functional leather cover for a 4x8 reporters notebook. The quality of the leather and craftsmanship are good, and it has a tight pen slot that will not let the pen slide out inadvertently. It also has a little folder pocket inside the top cover to hold other slips of paper or index cards.

The biggest problem with this notebook is that it is too soft, i.e. it does not have a stiff backing that improves your notetaking experience if you are standing on your feet. You have to find a reporters notebook with a stiff backing, but you don't need this cover at all if you have that.

I cut out a backing from a thicker notebook and used it behind the reporter notebook to provide a firmer writing surface because I used this strictly for field notes while on my feet. However, I discovered a reporters notebook with a very stiff backing that allows me to take standing notes without using this cover at all, so I am leaving it on the shelf more and more.

The cover is about 4&5/8"" wide. It fits into the back pocket of some of my pants, but not in others. I like the look of it, the quality, and the idea behind it, but unfortunately it is proving less and less useful for me.",8,9.818629

Other numbers faxed I had no problem with jamming issue. So I got a scanner app on my phone and am now scanning and sending the docs to the one number I had problems with, that seems to work fine. So, issue sort of resolved.
Regardless, this is not the best machine in the world. Made of a cheap plastic, big and bulky (one reason I didn't want to take it back again) but it does the job. I haven't had problems with the printer portion yet, fingers crossed. I have read many other reviews, here and elsewhere, of different printers, but they all seem to have some problems.

The ""arm"" mount (for lack of a better word) is also metal (with some plastic) and it slides very well in the track (owing, I think, to the grease that the track comes with, pre-applied). The pivot point that you can lock and unlock to adjust to your preferred height and angle work very well.  Installation was a breeze (although the instructions are the pictures-only, no real words kind of instructions -- which I don't like), and I was able to do it by myself. The only confusing part about the whole setup is the mouse pad arm. It can swing up, or fold out, and slide in and out. It also have a ""pin"" (for lack of a better word) that you can insert facing one way or another, which will dictate just how deeply the tray will fold in, or slide in. You will figure it out with trial and error, though.

My favorite part about the tray is that the mouse part of it can swivel independently from the main keyboard tray.  Which means, NO MORE MOUSE FALLING OFF THE TRAY!  I was very excited about that.  The only thing I would have liked to see on this system, would be a way to swivel the mouse arm forwards and backwards, as well and side to side.

4019,"-This is a very capable printer. I've always liked the laser printer in the office as it can print right up to the edge of the paper and this one can as well. That's why this unit is so wide, it doesn't have issues with paper margins like so many other printers do, also it seems to keep things centered very well also. The closer you print to the edges the easier it is to see if it's centered or not.
-Double sided printing, It's always nice to be able to tell the printer to do both sides of the paper, saves so a lot of paper.
-Wired and wireless printing. This printer does have the ability to print wirelessly and it works quite nicely.
-This is a standard CYMK style printer but the good part is that the cartridges for the ink are individual cartridges and can be replaced as such. Also HP makes high capacity cartridges for this printer as well. Those are always nice.

The problem I have come across already is when looking up for new ink cartridges the refillable sites don't have this type of ink cartridge listed for a refillable model. That would make life so much better as then ink prices drop drastically. It wouldn't be too hard to just fill these cartridges though but I'm not sure about how this unit will respond with stock cartridges that have been refilled. I will have to research that more and see if anyone has do that with this system at this time.

So go easy on your printing unless you don't mind buying the expensive cartridges for this type of printer. They can run up the cash level pretty quick if you aren't careful. The printer might be cheap but the ink will come back to bite you but that's with all printers anymore.

The overall quality of prints from what I have seen so far have been pretty good though it doesn't like cheap paper too much but does very well with mid grade paper, haven't had an issue yet with mid range priced reams of paper at this time.

4027,"I ordered the magicJack even though my wife and I use our cell phones exclusively, just to have a ""regular"" phone as a backup for emergencies. I've had my magicJack hooked up for a couple of months now and it seems to work fine. Loading the software, setting it up and choosing a phone number was simple. It did take a while to get the sound quality to a level I was satisfied with. I had to go into the audio settings on my computer and increase the audio level for the magicJack unit (very easy to find using Windows 7). Now it sounds just fine but it was a little tricky to figure out exactly what I had to do to improve the sound because the documentation for the magicJack isn't very good.

I don't leave the computer that the magicJack unit is connected to on all the time. I turn it off every night and turn it back on every morning and the magicJack program quickly starts up and reconnects with my phone every time. I did have one instance where my phone said it was getting no signal, but that was easily fixed by just unplugging the magicJack from my computer's USB port and plugging it back in after a minute. But again, there was nothing in the documentation saying how a connection could be lost or how to fix it.

4030,"Overall, these are very good ultra fine point pens, and I'm pretty happy with them, with some caveats.

First, the pros: The RT1 0.28mm has a very fine point, and writes very fine lines. The point is conical, so it doesn't look as fragile as, say, a Hi-Tec-C/G-Tec-C 0.3. It should easily stand up to pretty heavy handed writing, though I would recommend against that since the fine point can cut/tear paper more easily than a blunter point. Even though it's a capless (since it's a retractable) gel ink pen with a very fine point, it writes smoothly and generally without skipping and without starting issues. I've only been able to make it skip with very fast light writing. It doesn't really bleed the way a liquid ink pen (such as a rollerball) can, though it will spread a small bit if you rest the point motionless on paper. It dries very quickly, with no detectable smearing even if you write very slowly, and the only way I've found to get it to smear is to let the tip create a small puddle by holding it motionless on the paper. The long rubber grip is relatively comfortable.

Now for the cons: Of the four pens I received, the blue-black one clicks less smoothly than the other three. It still works fine, just not as nicely as the others. I suspect that this is a general manufacturing defect that isn't limited to that specific color. The pens are quite lightweight, which is beneficial when using them but makes them feel a bit cheap. The Signo DX line feels more solid, with a heavier and more rigid plastic body. The plunger top (which is also the clip) isn't attached to the rest of the plunger mechanism, and is relatively heavy for the part, so it can rattle a bit when you're writing.

I've used these for both general writing and for drawing small work-related diagrams, and the point size is extremely useful for the latter task.

4032,"There are many things I like about my new cordless Panasonic phone and answering system: The freedom it affords me--no more being stuck in one place when I'm on a long call;knowing who is calling so I can screen the many marketing calls; the speaker phone that gives me the freedom to do something else while I'm talking on the phone; being able to save telephone numbers, especially those important ones and erasing those I don't want to save; receiving messages from Call Waiting when important calls comes through and I'm on the phone with another caller. Have I forgotten anything? Probably. But I do enjoy my phone and have a few around the house so I can't miss any calls. And especially the important ones.

The only thing I might critique is the mispronunciation of many of the callers. Sometimes I have to stop what I'm doing in my office to check the caller's name. Although I do admit, it has given me a laugh or two.",2,5.485014

4034,"Thank you for the opportunity to test IKONG ink cartridges.  My printer is an HP Office Jet 8600 Plus.  I have always purchased HP Printers in the past.  The cartridges are very expensive.  But, they do last a long time.  I do use my printer a lot, both in my office and in my home.  It is painful to pay so much money to buy HP genuine ink cartridges.  I was excited to find these on Amazon at a much better price than I have been paying.  I like the way the cartridges were packaged.  I was very excited to get the cartridge installed and try them out.  I was terrible disappointed at the quality of printed material that the IKONG ink cartridges produced!  The colors were dull, washed out, almost blurry.  There were shades of green throughout the picture, with stripes on green in the background.  The picture I had copied was a recipe of a Raspberry Lemon Cheesecake Tart, with a picture of the recipe.  There were bright red raspberries on top of the tart.  The original picture looked really yummy!  The colors were bright and inviting especially the red raspberries, however the copy made with IKONG ink cartridges came out very pale, the red raspberries had very little red in them (kind of like they had been left out of the fridge for a week).  This was very disappointing.  I would not recommend this product.  I would rate it a 0!  So sorry ! I received this at a discount for my review.",2,8.100931

If this bothers you, buy another brand or just plan to use them for an entire scrapbook!

4043,"Having a well-performing shredder is dependent upon two factors: A quality-manufactured unit and regular maintenance.  The latter includes making sure the unit is lubricated properly to reduce cutting blade friction and motor wear.  This means taking about one minute for every 30 continuous minutes of shredding to insert one of these thin sheets into the unit to lubricate the cutting blades and clean debris from accumulating and compromising the performance of your shredder.  It's an easy and simple process and should result in a shredder with a long life.

I've used many different brands. These shredder sheets are mostly the same except for the type of lubricant used: Some use a petroleum-based oil while others such as this product use a biodegradable, non-petroleum lubricant which I prefer.  Here's why:

Product Advantages:

1. Royal Sovereign (RS) uses a biodegradable, non-petroleum based lubricant (most likely rice bran oil) which is environmentally-friendly.  US manufactured brands will most likely use petroleum-based lubricants.
2. These thin sheets insert easily into the width of your shredder's opening depositing a layer of oil for a perfect lubrication.
3. This product is designed to also clean paper debris from the blades-a major cause of clogging.
4. RS maintains an 800 number for customer support (See below).

Product Concerns:

1. Cost:  A bit costly at $12.32 for a package of 10 shredder sheets.
2.  Made in China. If you are concerned about the specific materials/lubricant used you can contact the manufacturer and request a PDF of the MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet) @ 1(800) 397-1025 (US customers) or 1 (905) 461-1095 (Canada).

Recommendations & Suggestions:

1. I liked and use these sheets when they were about $10 per package.  However, if you shred large amounts more frequently, it will be far more cost efficient to consider a bottle of shredder oil such as Fellowes Powershred Performance Shredder Lubricant.  Your daily volume of use should determine your decision in this instance.

2. Avoid using household cooking oils such as canola and other vegetable oils-it may be convenient and cost effective in the short term but it is not the correct viscosity or formulation for use in your shredder.

3. You should not have to spend more than $1 per sheet. Shop around and consider purchasing in larger quantities for the best deal.

4048,"This has to be one of the best bargains in all of fountain pens. Is it a little too expensive at the US price of ~$150? Yes. Is it an absolute steal for under $80? darn tootin.

Shipping was super quick, it arrived almost a week before the predicted arrival range.

I was really on the fence between chartres blue and the red. Glad I went with blue. The blue is much prettier in person, a semi-translucent, deep stained glass blue. The plastic used to make it isn't lamy 2000 levels of quality (there is a seam in the plastic of the grip section from the mold, everything else is smooth)  but it's on par with pilot's custom 74/91, and a little better than the entry level PTL5000A and seremo.

The pen has two real party pieces. Firstly, is platinum's ""slip and seal"", which is essentially just a little cup around the nib that is sprung so the nib presses firmly into it and creates a fantastic seal - this thing is pretty much immune to drying out. it also creates tension on the threads, keeping it from unscrewing easily. Really smooth, wonderfully cut threads, this pen is a pleasure to uncap.

I'm not hugely into the clip. it's just too tight and blunted to be effective at slipping into my uniform breast pocket, which is a pretty good test for a clip's smoothness. but I do really like the tapered design, which makes sliding it into the pocket nice.

Overall weight of the pen is fairly light, maybe a touch heavier than the pilot custom 91. It's usable unposted but with my large hands, I post it, and the cap is very light and doesn't backweight the pen, and posts deeply and securely.  The pilot 74/91 are a hair better in the grip section, but they're both very comfortable pens to hold and write for a long time.

The other really sharp part of this pen is the gorgeous nib. Platinum's 3776 is a very unique nib, broad and flat, and very pretty. Much more so than pilot's small gold nibs, this isn't huge, closer in size to a #6, but it stands out hugely.

Nib performance is also great. it's fairly soft, a tiny bit firmer than the pilot 91 soft fine (I can only really tell when holding them side by side) and toothier, and mine sings a tiny bit, which doesn't bother me, and will go away with time. It's a touch toothy, not scratchy at all. Tines were aligned perfectly out of the box. I quite like this level of feedback in my pens, it makes each action feel a little more deliberate, as if you were writing with a toothy brause rose dip nib. The pilot 74/91 SF is a little softer and gives you maybe 10% wider lines, but isn't quite as well balanced when writing normally (and I know how to write with wet noodles, the 3776 is just a little more consistent flowing when not flexed)

I would personally rate the pilot 91 SF a more fun nib, but this is more usable and still quite capable of adding flourishes to downstrokes. It's happy to flex, down to the feed, without issue. A true japanese F, too, with medium-wet flow. Some super dry inks like Rohrer and Klinger scabiosa iron gall can railroad when flexed a lot, but thusfar that's the only ink I've had in it that has had any issues. It keeps up with everything else.

Line variation is about identical to the pilot 14k ceremo entry level gold nib, but the 3776 is a bit softer.

It's also a phenomenal reverse writer, smooth and consistent japanese EF (western EEF). The pilot can't do that at all.

Overall, if you want a nib that you can practice mild spencerian writing with, the Pilot 74/91 soft fines will do a little better. And in the hand, the pilot is a little better. But for everyday writing, the 3776 has so much going for it. It's soft, bouncy, gives a little line variation. is more consistent, is plenty comfortable, and the cap seal is absolutely peerless. Platinum only uses the one converter type (not included but mandatory, because you SHOULD be using bottled ink!) which is fine, but if you need a massive ink capacity, the pilot can be had with the CON70 converter, a vac filler with a huge capacity.

Personally, having the 91 in soft fine and the 74 in music, I prefer the 3776. It's got more presence, a nice color (the others can only be had at this price in black) and better daily use manners.

The other benefit to this pen is that between the converter and the gold nib there is no metal, so this pen is a prime candidate for use with fountain pen iron gall inks like KWZ, Rohrer and Klinger, and platinum's own ""classic"" inks, since iron gall corrodes steel but not gold.",11,12.290111

  I put it through its paces -- copying, scanning, printing photos from a photo card, and using the pic-bridge.  Oh yea, I also did normal printing.  It passed all these tests with flying colors.

  I find that for documents and general printing (not photos), changing the default print mode to fast gives a very crisp document, and probably saves on ink.  I also set my default to print multi-page items from back to front so that I do not have to reorder them after printing.

4056,"For the price, you can't beat this. It's a solid monitor holder. Easy to connect the monitors, easy to set up.

Pros:
 - The cable routing is great. Easy to clip cables in place without them slipping too much.
 - The arms and monitors have a nice amount of resistance to movement: they're very easy to move, but stay in place even with me banging away on the desk now and then.
 - Simple setup and good looking

Cons:
 - Moving the monitors *up and down* is quite difficult to do in small increments. They're held vertically on the pole by a simple clamp, so you have to loosen the clamp and then move the weight of the monitors against the much lighter weight base. This would benefit from some kind of worm screw.
 - The arms are definitely ""drooping"" a little with even the weight of two simple 24"" monitors. Not a big deal since the adjustment for the monitor position and orientation lets you still set up the monitors square to each other, but some OCD folks might be bothered by this
 - The base still (understandably) takes up a decent amount of space on your desk. You can't extend the monitors ""forward"" too much or the whole thing will fall over. The center of gravity of the system needs to be over the base. This isn't a shocking revelation, but do know you might not be getting quite as much desk space back as you thought.

The trouble is that the connection between the palm and the cradle doesn't lock.  Also the connection between the sync cable and the cradle doesn't lock either (it's exactly the same connector).  Palm designed these connectors to be easy to connect and disconnect - which is great when connecting the Palm to the sync cable.  The problem is that the connection between the sync cable and the cradle need to be secure - and it isn't.  When the connection becomes loose you get bad syncs, data corruption, freezes, etc...  We've had no end of trouble with these on our network because of this issue.  The fix is to unmate and remate the cable connections - easy enough, but the periodic problems have led me to ban these cradles from our list of supported gear.

Some others have complained about the blue LED light.  You need this light to tell you when you've got the Palm properly seated in the cradle - otherwise you might not know you've got it down onto the connector far enough.  I think of the light as a feature - not a problem.

The ultimate solution would be a pair of wire bails on the back of the cradle that you'd use to lock the sync cable on.  Too bad they didn't think of that.",10,7.6727257

4083,"It seemed like a reasonable printer at first, then it started having issues with the software.  A whole variety of errors, finally resulting in our taking it back to the store for a refund when it was less than a year old.

It seems to be common to have color printers these days refuse to print black and white if their color inks are seen as empty.  It is also common for these vendors to say the ink containers are empty when they are not.
Amazingly, they also won't allow refills and reuse of the same cartridges successively.

So the ink ends up costing far more than the printer did really quickly.  In spite of this, out of laziness or inertia, we were going to keep the thing in spite of its frequent paper jams, errors, and wasteful use of ink.  Then it failed completely.

We had bought a Brother B&W laser printer that operated cheaply and flawlessly, so we decided to replace this one with a Brother MFC J5720DW.

You still have to void the warranty of the printer head. After that, it will allow most the ink cartrige refilled. However, it does not do that to all the ink cartriges.  Some times, you still have to check the ink level, then wait for the warning message saying no ink in tank (you actually have a full tank refilled ink in it), then push the continue button on printer to let the printing continue with the refilled inks.

I don't know why Canon have to pull so many stops for people using refilled ink. Otherwise, this will be a wonderful printer.

I have found since I have made my purchase that the dura-lar has many many uses, I have used it as a shield for air brushing, protecting and displaying artwork, making gift boxes with a clear window, and many other crafts.  The dura-lar is acid free so it will protect items from discoloring with time.  The film can be used in a printer (manual feed).

4088,"Bought this on Newegg on special for $160 with free shipping.  Ordered on Sunday night and had it on Tuesday.  I usually love Amazon but in this case Newegg was much better.  In sum, you really can't find a better combination of features and quality for the price.  The only real complaint I have is that sometimes documents fed through the automatic document feeder aren't 100 percent straight (more like 98 percent straight, but this is only a problem sometimes).

PROS:  Auto-duplexing for input and output; 35-page document feeder; great quality when using high print settings; good speed at all settings (unless it's 2-sided); two paper inputs allows you to keep two different papers in the printer at all times, or to just close the top feed if you want; fast and high quality faxing with lots of features (fax isn't just an afterthought in this machine); multiple ink tanks means no disposing of partially full ink cartridges; very good driver software gives you lots of printing options through your computer; many copy, fax and scan options built into the machine and accessible through nice rotating LCD screen; no paper jams yet (UPDATED: Still no jams after over three months of continuous use!).

CONS:  It's BIG, as in seriously big and heavy too; like I said above, about one-third of the time documents fed through the document feeder are just the slightest bit off; duplex printing is slow because it stops for ten seconds to let the ink dry on one side before printing the other side; text printed at low quality can be fuzzy, definitely use high print quality for important documents; it's a little on the noisy side and even has a ""quiet mode"" that I haven't tried yet; after two weeks of use I had to run the ""unclog nozzle"" routine to make some black streaking go away (I realize that maintenance is needed sometimes but after just two weeks seems a bit soon); would be nice if it came with a USB cable; photo printing gobbles up ink.

Overall so far I'm quite satisfied, though if the document feeder issue gets worse before the one year warranty expires I'll send it to Canon for service.  And if need be I can always place documents on the glass by hand.  Without that issue I'd give it 5 stars.

(Note, after 13 months of use this printer fell off a table and stopped working.  So be careful and don't drop your printer.)",7,7.883916
4089,"I was pleasantly surprised. Far too often an non-OEM unit will cause an error message, and the unit may fail to function properly as a result.
Not with this.  I did get a message from the HP printer that I was using a ""remanufactured"" cartridge, I dismissed it, and it worked fine.
I've not yet tracked how many copies I get from these so have not given it five stars. But at this stage, would recommend.

6 March 2017:  Have read other reviews saying quality is not good enough for photos. OK, I'll go with that. But I'm not printing photos, just black/white/color copies. I've had some sporadic print quality issues with these, but have not ruled out the printer (HP) being the issue, either.

4090,"I have been using Brother laser printers for years now, and I chose this model to replace my HL-2040 because of the wireless and automatic duplex printing features, although it has other advantages as well.  It comes with a CD-ROM to install the Mac and PC drivers and that contains the documentation in several languages, a power cable, and a starter toner cartridge that will print up to 700 pages.  I had my printer up and running on my wireless network in fifteen minutes.

Like other Brother printers, the HL2270DW is fairly lightweight, although it feels much more substantial than many single-purpose inkjet printers.  The print quality, especially without the toner saver option selected, is excellent.  Even the toner saver option produces documents with decent contrast.  To learn about all the features and how to use them, you'll have to read the documentation on the CD under the header of your platform, PC or Mac.  You select the print options/features through the on-screen menu of your printer.  Unfortunately, because the unit itself in no-frills, it does not have a display screen to let you know the current settings.

Unfortunately, this printer is what I call a ""disposable printer"" because once the drum needs to be replaced, it's sometimes more cost-effective to replace the printer than replace the drum, although you can try a generic or third-party drum unit, most of which are priced well below the brand-name ones.  I've always been leery of doing this myself, but I know of people who have had success going this route.

Pros: wireless, wired, or USB (printer USB cable not included) connection; moderately fast printing (up to 27 ppm); black matte plastic case for higher-end appearance; a toner saver setting; automatic duplex (two-sided) printing capability; included drivers for both PC and Mac OS X; lots of features in a budget laser printer.

Cons: drum unit replacement can be costly; no way of selecting print options on the machine itself.

For the price and quality, this printer cannot be beat.

(painting baseboards,  washing lower windows,...etc)  For that purpose it has been a wonderful tool and I've been using it several times a day to save my back.  I read the warnings about the awful smell before ordering,  but I hoped that those comments were from extremely smell sensitive people and that it wouldn't be that bad.  WRONG!!  It IS every much that bad,..so bad that it gives you a headache if you are close to it,  and you wonder what kind of toxic chemicals it is actually made with.  I finally started covering it with a folded towel,  and that made the smell go away for the most part.  It has been about two weeks or so since I ordered it and the smell has improved somewhat,  but it MUST be stored in the garage because the smell is completely unbearable!

I would not order this item again due to that fact alone,  even though it is built like a tank.
I would suggest that if you live in a small home or apartment where you plan on keeping this item inside,  don't do it because you'll be very sorry!  Not only does it smell awful,  but it's probably a health hazard as well.  Two other adults in this household agree!

Update April 14 2013:

Don't do it!  The smell isn't going away.  It's horrible.  This won't be your ""go to"" stool because you'll have to keep it way far away.  Really it should be illegal.  It's built like a tank yet smells like an oil tank...and I can't imagine that it is not toxic to breath the fumes that it puts off.

Drive Medical,  you really need to address this problem.

UPDATE: April 4 2013

Oddly enough,  this stool accidentally spent a few hours in front of a portable heater that I was using to dry a small painted powder room,  (with the door closed) and the horrible smell greatly subsided!  The stool got very hot.  The only thing I can think of is that the heat burned off some of the horrible chemical that it was off-gassing.  My suggestion is that if you have this stool,  that you put it out in the sun in the dead heat of the summer and burn off some of the chemicals.  It is very handy and we have used it quite often,  but the smell has been such that you always know where the stool resides because you can smell it when you walk into the room.",38,9.605986

I'll skip the technical details and get right to the stuff that always vexes me as far as printers: color calibration.

It's taken me about two years to finally figure out how to calibrate this thing so that the colors weren't ""muddy"" and muted on my prints. There were two keys: one was to create a new ""layer"" in Photoshop with my watercolor painting and to set it at 80-90% transparency.

The second, and most important, is USE GOOD PAPER. I spent months trying to calibrate my printer using office supply store cardstock because I didn't want to waste ""good"" paper while I tried to figure out the color calibration. Then, on a lark, I threw in a piece of good watercolor paper and the colors came out crisp and beautiful. The cheapy cardstock and uncoated paper sucks up these particular inks like nobody's business, so go right to the good paper when you are printing out test prints. You might lost a few sheets in the process, but I promise you that it will save you tons of time in the long run.

It does seem to go through ink a little quickly, but I'm printing full color prints with HUGE pools of color and it's doing okay.

I had several problems with the Staedtler marker pens....these are water based markers, not true pens as far as I am concerned...many are very scratchy and the ink simply did not flow as I expected...flecks from the tip of the marker pens were left behind on my work, this was most noticeable with the lighter colors...the color was no more brilliant than the Crayola brand...the colors were not close to most of the tips, but this true of many brands.

4124,I am a BIG fan of Prismacolor Pencils and we use them in our graphic dept all the time.  What I noticed was these were not as soft as what they used to be.  I'm not sure if Prismacolor changed their pencils or if it is this particular pencil box.  It did say Soft Core Colored Pencils so I was expecting them to be softer for an easier blend.  BUT they are still very good quality and would recommend Prismacolor over any other brand.,4,4.675727

4126,As others have mentioned- there is a lead warning on this which I haven't seen on any other sharpener- that asks you to wash your hands essentially after every use as there is no safe level of lead in humans. In addition- one end of the sharpening blade is exposed- so someone who isn't very careful could cut themselves while handling this. It will put a point on a pencil but there are better sharpener choices out there for the money.,4,5.148282

4128,"I bought this with the intention of organizing and storing my gel pens and sharpies. . As I brought these up to my studio, I saw a need for a different item that needed better organization. . My paint brushes.

I was using a kitchen utensil caddy for my brushes previously. . Picture included. It was always a mess. The brushes stuck out all over the place so it was hard to store them. Not to mention that if I was working on a painting, the caddy took up way too much surface area in my work space. Plus, I use my paint brushes a lot more often than I use gel pens. So, I now put my gel pens and sharpies in the caddy, and my paint brushes and pallet knives found a new home in these organizers that are much easier to move around :) Problem solved.

Something to note. The bottom cubby's on these organizers are NOT at an incline. They are clearly not at an incline in the photo, I just didn't pay attention lol. But, if you are thinking about using these for pencils, the bottom would be a perfect place to put erasers, sharpeners, or even paper clips :D

As for the quality, it's not the best but each organizer is one solid piece and it's just meant to sit there and hold things. . so they should pretty much last for many years to come. I personally thought the price was a bit high, but once I go them and thought about it for a minute, if they last like I think they will, it's definitely worth it.

I received this item on a promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. I tested and reviewed this product myself.",6,9.416011
4129,"I purchased this scanner and while it is quick to get it up and running, the output is NOT what I would consider acceptable quality.  I have several hundred 35mm slides which I need to scan and many are very nice quality.  This scanner produced very dark and purple-blue images which are quite difficult and almost impossible to overcome in Adobe Photo Shop because they are so poor when they come out of the scanner.  A good slide scanner should provide you with an acceptable image that is not overly bright, dark, contrasted, or injected with too much color saturation.  That way you can make a little ""tweak"" to them with photo software to bring them up to a very nice image, somewhat compatible to the original slide.

The user guide that comes with it is very poorly written, almost like it was written by a person from another country that doesn't quite have command of the English Language.  Some of the instructions are rather ""squirrely"" and you have to put the user guide down and just play with it to figure out what is going on. After playing with it for an hour or so, I realized that this is more of a plastic toy than a true 35mm quality scanner, so I returned it.

If you just have a bunch of old slides you want to slap into digital format and you don't care about the quality, then this might work for you.  Otherwise, you might be better off to look at some of the flatbed scanners that also do slides. It takes more time to scan them, but what you get is going to be a lot nicer to look at, especially if they are of family members or memories that are important to you.",78,8.074105
4130,"I ordered a portfolio in black on my first purchase which I use for taking the Sunday sermons in church and Bible study notes.  This is my second purchase of a Royce item and this time I ordered the British Brown color and it is absolutely stunning.  This beautiful leather portfolio is well made and sturdy.  It appears to be smug and smear resistant which is a great perk.  It has a place for several resumes on the left side, two side by side slots for your identification and a few business cards, with a second slot above both of those to hold a few pages. On the right side of the portfolio there is room to insert replaceable legal pads for taking notes.  There is even a slot in the fold to hold a pen so you don't have to search for one while in meetings.  I went on my interview today at 2 pm and felt like I was the lead interviewer of the three people who interviewed me..  Having such a fabulous portfolio gave me the confidence and charisma while answering the interview questions and I know I got the position!!!

4133,"I've always been fascinated with fountain pens. I mean, it takes skill to write with one, so there is an air of seriousness and intent surrounding them. After all, technicalities aside, you don't tweet with a fountain pen.

Also, the pen itself is an engineering marvel -- an aestetically pleasing outer shell enclosing a carefully designed system to enhance a controlled leak of the contained ink via capillary action through the nib. I mean, really, when they wrote ""the pen is mightier than the sword"", I don't think they were referring to the cheap plastic pen attached to a chain at the post office.

The other main ingredient to the system is the ink. The ink is what leaves a mark on the paper -- an expression of the writer's intent, creativity, and expression. It is what conveys the words to the reader. And leaving writers aside for a moment, I'll note that an octopus risks his life on the quality of his ink. So the choice of ink is not a trivial decision.

Though I'll leave fountain pens for another discussion, regarding inks, I must say I've really been happy with the Noodler's Heart of Darkness Black Fountain Pen Ink ink.

In case it isn't obvious from the Joseph Conrad allusion, this ink is really black. Blackhole kind of black. It is also, well, bulletproof, in that it is meant to stick around on the paper for a long time. No worries about your snail mail address washing away when your letter drops into a puddle on route.

This package offered by Amazon includes a free fountain pen with the bottle of ink. The bottle of ink itself has a built-in dropper for ease in refills. The free fountain pen is probably not the best fountain pen around, but I have really enjoyed it and use it almost daily -- this is the pen I carry around with me in my bag. I don't have to worry about it getting stolen or broken, and so carry it with me wherever I go. As a result, it actually gets used more than some of my other pens. And so far, it always writes when I want it to write, so I really can't complain.

But the main attraction here is the ink. If you are confident in what you want to say, and want the security of knowing it won't be lost or distorted, then choose Noodler's Heart of Darkness Black.

If you are interested in using this ink, consider a larger nib or a broad nib.  I decided to use laser copy paper and a larger nib, so it would not feather.  If you use a relatively absorbent paper the text will be darker and you might have a hint of feathering.  I attach an image so you can see for yourself.

4139,"I own a lot of these.... for various reasons... to raise displays, printers, to raise mouse pad when working in a recliner or on the couch.... no end to the number of applications these offer.  Not only do they raise items...they also provide excellent added desk top space below.

The Ergo 3 IMO is the KING of stands.... it has a few distinct advantages...  the
most obvious is, height adjust-ability.  While other monitor stands offer the same, most are plastic...this is a metal...and the legs raise and lower via a spring loaded ball bearing that lands in 3 different holes in the lower leg.  This is a VERY strong lock, vs. plastic blocks that u stack with others such as 3M and the amazon model.
This also has the advantage of having holes in the surface, much more desirable for heat dissipation for some devices u might place on them.  A non issues for a LCD display.
Nicely finished  with black paint.
This prob. has the highest weight rating of any of the displays,although I have not compared the specs of every model...its by far the most rock solid stand I own.
My only minor complaint is... the rubber feet are stick on type, with peel away adhesive pads... of course, they will fall off.  I would suggest cupped feet to so they remain affixed when moving the stand around...but hard to ding a point for that....
if u want a heavy duty stand, this is your best bet.....",9,9.227367

I admit to having a bit of an obsession with journals, although the only time I actually DO any journaling is when I travel.  Given that, however, I was eager to check out this travel journal by 7Felicity.  When it arrived, I was surprised by its small size, but I shouldn't have been--it is described as a ""pocket"" journal, and that is in fact exactly what it is!

This adorable little journal offers a ton of options.  It has an attractive leather cover with a self-fastener.  Inside, there is a compass-like placeholder, a brass holder for keeping the pages down, two plastic inserts--one looks like it would hold mini photos, and the other has a zip top to catch mementos--and finally, four removable, refillable notebooks (actually, the fourth was included separate for me).  I received one notebook with lined paper, one with craft-type brown paper, and two with ivory pages.  They are secured with bungee-type cord, and there is an extra cord included.  (I admit that when I removed two of the notebooks to rearrange them, I could not figure out how they were attached, as there was only two bungee cords but three notebooks; a short instructional sheet would have been helpful!)

Just choose the ""Home"" mode--or the ""Professional"" mode, if you are an advanced photo scanner--and you will find a very easy to use photo scanner box.  There are a lot of choices you can choose from to do the type of scanning you need, and even more choices if you go to the ""Professional"" mode. The last time I scanned photos was many years ago with a terrific Canon photo scanner.  But I fear the features of that Canon seem quite obsolete compared to this Epson.

In fact, I can't imagine any dedicated photo scanner having more features than this one...except this scanner does not do negatives or slides.  One of my favorite features of the photo scanning is the ""Restore Color"" feature.  It really does do an excellent job of making older, faded photographs look newer.  One 1940's portrait, on matte type paper, that I scanned this weekend, surprised me to no end when I saw the finished scan.  I just leave the  ""Restore Color"" and ""Remove Dust Specks"" boxes checked all the time.  There is also a ""Fix Backlit Photos"" feature and a ""Descreening"" feature.  And the photos can be saved in various ""jpeg"" and ""tiff"" formats . . . more than I possibly can understand.  That is my one complaint about this very nice scanner--I only wish Epson would have included a detailed paper manual, instead of having only an online manual.  It's just not the same.

Update May 2012:  This scanner also does a great job of scanning old photographs that you are trying to sell online, and need a very accurate scan of the photo.  Just don't check any boxes to correct the photo, and your potential buyer online will see the photo as it truly is.

4175,"Quite simply, when it comes to label makers, I've seems I've always had my trusty Brother P-Touch in my desk drawer. What it comes to quick label making, the Brother line of products is second to none. I've tried others, only to go right back to using Brother.=This unit replaced one that I've had for over a decade (that still works), but lacks the features of this updated model). The layout of buttons on this would seem confusing at first, but once you get to actually using it, the functions are fairly user friendly and intuitive. It makes labels of all different lengths and widths and the latest software has a ton of useful fonts, borders, and graphics. The only reason I nicked it one star is for the seemingly unnecessary length of blank label that pushes out of the printer (about 3/4"") after your label prints. You always end up snipping this part off with scissors and throwing it away. Seeing as the labels aren't exactly cheap, it almost seems like a deliberate plan to waste some label so you have to purchase them more often. If you can get over that little quirk, this is a truly excellent, well-designed, well-priced little dynamo for all of your labeling needs.",2,4.8293867
4176,"This is the second Ivation safe I own, and I have to say that I really like this design. That is because it eliminates issues incorporated with other safes I had tried, and those mainly hinge on a person's ability to open the door quickly and with ease including both button responsiveness and handle use/door alignment.

When you first get this, I am going to suggest you air it out because it has a strong interior smell (or mine did, at least). It took me a good day to air the smell out, and I have not had any issue with that since. I am not deducting for this because it went away with a minimal amount of effort, but I also figured this should be noted.

After you air it out, get your keys out out and remove the Ivation logo on the front. Underneath is a key method for unlocking, so be mindful of this when thinking about where to keep the keys in the future. Interesting, I like the way this is hidden because it does not remove so easily that it gives away the spot, but it is not too hidden that you cannot find it. When I first got this, I tried finding the lock placement knowing it was there, and it was not the easiest to find because the logo grips in place solidly. That allows a person to get inside if the batteries to this go dead, but it keeps people in a hurry from finding it too easily.

Once this is unlocked, you will notice two things. First, there is a battery compartment on the flush area of the door and, secondly, there is a small switch on the top. After you place the batteries (included with this), find the button; it is easy to see because it is red, so there is no confusing what you are looking for. Depress it to set or reset the code, then go and type in a code. After it is set, close the safe (making SURE you have your keys in your hand and NOT inside in case you screwed up) and enter the code to make sure it is working properly. Easy Peezy.

Note that there ARE instructions detailing how to do so, which Ivation is REALLY good at supplying.

When it comes to the safe, this is a solid item that is well-made and keeps people out. I like the presentation including color choices and texture, and i like the way the buttons and handle are located both because of aesthetics and because of functional considerations. The weight is good because it is heavy enough to be useful but is also light enough to be versatile, allowing placement and movement. you can anchor it for additional safety considerations, or you can keep it free (I do) so you can move it around.

With this, there are a lot of things I like, even over some biometric/numeric types. I saw that owning a really good one by Ivation and friends/ family members having a few different types i can play with as well, so I put a bit of time into comparing likes/dislikes. For myself, I still like the biometric type for quick access to a handgun, but this is a good way to keep things close by and easy to reach as well. It also fits into areas where you might not be able to get a larger safe into, and it is well-made so you do not have to worry about it messing up and allowing access to people and kids especially. THIS is a huge consideration for me and is balanced by our need for firearms because our police responsiveness sometimes ranges into 1 1/2 hours or more due to our remote locale. As an additional consideration, remember that some people recall codes better than anything in panic situations because we have been conditioned to type things like 911 all our lives and a lighter, still solid safe makes for easy access. I actually timed both types for me in an environment without any pressure, and I managed to code in the biometrics faster on another Ivation type but I actually managed to open this easier because of the handle type/lighter door. Again, this is very unscientific, but it does give you a few things you might want to consider when thinking about what types of safes are useful for you.

For storage, you have a good amount of room, with this fitting a firearm in a case, ammunition, more items, and still leaving room. I like the fact that I can easily place and pull anything out in an relatively quick time, too, giving me something I can use in a number of spots where a larger safe simply would not work out. The interior is an eclectic choice (look at the pictures), making it something I like even more when it comes down to it.

I am thinking of adding a video later, but am currently in the process of moving residences. With that, this has been quite useful because it has also let me keep up with some items I do not want others having access to, and without being so heavy that it takes a team of people and steroids to move it.

Please note this was supplied for sampling purposes at reduced or no cost. Hopefully the content shows i put almost 21 days into testing and thinking out what it does/does not do well, plus there were comparisons applied. Sampling allows this and does not impact ratings.",2,9.388013

While the TI-Nspire appears to be a great product, it turned out to be almost completely useless for me as the documentation is literally the worst I've seen in many, many years. I've now printed out a huge amount of material on how to use it but none of those materials really covers the nitty-gritty and it is left up to the user to find something that works.

This is really as shame because the TI-Inspire appears to be a very useful device that is filled with features for many, many different types of students. At the present time, there are also no books available on how to use it (even the ""dummy series"" - which I generally do not like - keeps getting delayed). After trying to get help for several weeks, I did get a TI rep to help explain a few things but, even then, it was not enough.

The only problems I've had with the hardware is that the the screen can be extremely difficult to read if there is not enough light (it should have been backlighted) and the keys are rather small. If you're careful, you won't have many problem but you do need to make sure that what you've intended to enter is what really made it in.

Another, rather disturbing, problem is that TI has a software application that can be used to create materials for the Nspire. That software, should be provide free but, instead, TI charge almost as much as the device.

4194,"Okay, let's get to the meat of this review...

This is the printer that most of you are going to want to get your hands on. Whether for personal or business use, the WF-R4640 handles all your printing, scanning, faxing and copying needs quickly and flawlessly.

I am so happy that Epson gave me the opportunity to test this printer alongside its smaller (and less expensive) sibling, the ET-4500.  I will make references to both printers throughout this review so you have a comparison of why one might suit your needs more than the other.  You can also click on my profile and see my recent review of the ET-4500.

So, let's begin, shall we?

First of all, this printer is an absolute BEAST.  When it arrives on your doorstep, you will be rather amazed at how large the shipping box is.  Epson recommends that two people take part in lifting this computer.  I am relatively strong and fit, so I was able to do it on my own, though I will admit, it was quite a struggle single-handedly lifting the printer from the ground floor to the upstairs office, hoisting it on a stand.

Epson has done an excellent job packing this printer for transport.  It is loaded with tape and inserts that protect all the parts inside.  You will spend the first 5 minutes peeling off dozens of protective tape strips and removing styrofoam inserts.  Quite frankly, I was very pleased that Epson took such care in making certain my printer arrived undamaged.

Enclosed with your software disc is a Quick Start Guide.  This is all you need to quickly reference and set up this printer.

The first thing I was relieved to find was that the installation of ink is quick and painless.  Now let me use this opportunity to compare the process to the ET-4500, which comes with 4 bottles of ink that you need to manually pour into reservoirs.  It's a somewhat messy process where one needs to wear protective gloves.  Not so with the WF-R4640.  The ink comes in 4 large bags.  You simply shake each bag vigorously for 20 seconds and then insert them into the printer.  What I really liked about this process was the printer's pop-out cartridge in which the bag of ink easily rests upon before being snapped to closure.

Oh, and please heed the warnings on the ink bags....don't drink the ink.  :)

Turn on the printer and it takes about 12 minutes for the ink to be primed throughout.  That's 8 minutes faster than the ET-4500.

A big upgrade on the WF-R4640 is its 4.3"" Color Touch Screen.  It's such a pleasure to use compared to the ET-4500 which is mono and not touch responsive.  I love the fact that I can use the screen as I would my smartphone.  From start to finish, the setup process is executed by simply touching your finger on each selection.  In some cases, there is a small QWERTY keyboard where you can type in your Fax header and phone number.  The color menu is very attractive and makes it so very easy to pick the function you want the WF-R4640 to do.

Connecting to the WiFi network was effortless as well.  The hard way of setting up your WiFi network would be to install the enclosed software and connect your Mac/PC to the printer via USB.  However, why go through all that?  Just use the touch screen to select SETUP and then choose the WIFI WIZARD option, which scans for your home network and then prompts you to enter a password.  I had my WF-R4640 connected to my home network in no time.  By the way, I should mention at this point that I use Mac computers in my home and business.  No compatibility issues at all, except for document scanning, which I will talk about shortly.

The big reason why you are reading this review is that you want to know about print quality.  I think I am in the perfect position to give you an idea of how well the WF-R4640 compares to most laser printers (as I own a recent, popular Brother laser) as well as an ink-jet printer such as the ET-4500.

Epson doesn't describe this model as a ""laser"" printer.  They tout their ""Precision Core"" technology whose performance they claim goes beyond laser.  Quite frankly, that's a claim that is difficult for me to confirm.  I can tell you without hesitation that the WF-R4640 is leaps and bounds ahead of its smaller sibling, the ET-4500 in speed and print quality.  I mean, printed Internet pages with lots of background information came out wet on the inkjet computer.  Not so on the WF-R4640.  At 20 ppm, this printer is 4 times faster than its sibling...and it really shows.  Print jobs were very quick, with results churned through this machine in no time.

The Brother 4570 (which is their most popular laser model) boasts 30 ppm, and though that means that its printing is faster, it's not night and day when comparing it to the Epson.

I mention the Brother model because that is the laser printer I have been using over the past two years.  Comparing the two, I found the print results to be almost indistinguishable.  Both featured razor-sharp text.  Both produced equally pleasing images, though I would not use either for printing photos.  You really need a specialized printer for that.  The Brother laser provided slightly more vivid/pronounced text and images but the differences were rather subtle.

So if already owned a very good laser printer, why did I even consider the Epson WF-R4640?

Well, that's a question that's easy to answer on several levels....

First, this is an all-in-one machine that meets the needs of a home business like mine.  For the longest time, our office had separate scanner and faxing machines.  We can now get rid of those individual machines and rely upon the Epson to do all of that...and more.  There were no problems sending out a test fax to my old machine.  It was great that the fax contained the header information I had programmed into the Epson.  Copies of documents looked identical to the original, so I am very pleased with the overall copying functionality.  Document scanning worked in principle.  I was able to easily scan a document through the printer's top feeder.  It wirelessly initiated the document capture software on my iMac.  The problem was, the document software on the iMac could not process the document.  Several attempts put the Epson printer into ""interrupt"" mode, which essentially is an error mode.  Now, mind you, I am using a pre-release version of El Capitan OS X.  I have no doubts in my mind that the problems I am experiencing are due to Epson not providing a final software update compatible with the upcoming operating system.  At least I know that the WF-R4640 is communicating wirelessly with my Mac and Epson only needs to provide a software update to fix the document issue.

It's kind of funny that I am this far down in the review and I am just starting to talk about this printer's ink capacity...

Okay, so you are paying somewhat more for an all-in-one like this.  Well, your investment is in the ink itself.  This printer comes with enough ink to print 20,000 black/20,000 color documents.  Now think about that kind of capacity for a moment.  Even in a busy work environment, that's a lot of ink.  In a home environment, with normal years, it would take years to deplete that supply.  Additionally, it is my understanding that replacing the ink is much cheaper than dealing with cartridge replacements.  So, this is an investment that will pay off in the long run.

Epson did provide me both the WF-R4640 and ET-4500 printers to test side-by-side.  Epson made it very clear to me that I could say whatever I want about these two models, be it good or bad.

My review of the ET-4500 was not totally favorable because I felt that it wasn't suited for home business use, but rather for families that need a basic printer with all the bells-and-whistles.  I also did not totally approve of print quality and speed.

The WF-R4640 is built for business.  It's fast enough to tackle big jobs and the print quality is comparable to expensive laser printers.  With two letter trays, its paper capacity is ample enough that you won't have to keep refilling.  I would not be surprised if this printer becomes the new standard for what other printer companies must now strive for.

4195,"I wanted to use this to mount a utensil rack so I wouldn't have to drill holes.  When I got it, I found that the tape could not hold the rack because of the weight of the utensils.  I was disappointed.  (I'm going to try my commercial strength adhesive velcro.  That usually holds anything.)

The instructions on the back state:
4 inches of tape for every 1 pound of weight

So measure the space that will sit FLAT on the surface to determine if there is enough surface space for the amount of tape you need.  In my case, there was only about a half inch of surface space on each end, thus it would hold only 1/2 pound with this tape.

4210,"The printer is supposed to offer four major features. Printing, Scanning, Copying and Faxing.

Let's start with the good. The scanning is a great process, the speed depends on the dpi you're scanning it and the whole process is fairly simple. You can scan a seven page document in poor-yet-readable quality in about less than a minute. I find this phenomenal. Faxes usually come in worse quality so it's fair to say I'd give the scanner a full five because there are a thousand options there. One ethernet cable, one phone line cable and one power cable plugs to the back.

The process of installing a cartridge for the printer's ink is particularly cumbersome. The plastic in the front can be difficult to close especially if your printer doesn't have a lot of space around it and is fitted into a compartment. At my work, they promote usage of generic ink cartridge which really only worsens things. A strong recommendation is to buy original toner etc and pay $10 more.

Copying is fair, it could be faster and a little more accurate. The build quality of this printer is rather good when you compare it with the older Brother.

Printing is not fast at all. Often pages come out half printed and the printer jumbles stuff up. This mostly happen if the printer is connected with three computers and you are printing eight sheets each on every single computer. The printing aspect is this printer's low point. While good for home-office use, this printer is not good for use in an office that requires constant printing. Say 200 pages a day, this printer doesn't meet the demand. The sleep feature is a headache. Let me not even explain that.

Sending faxes is a dying art so it really doesn't matter that much but I always close my eyes and cross my fingers when I'm supposed to send a fax to our other offices.

Overall, while this printer is an improvement I wish it was a more efficient, a more faster printer. We have two of these at our work place and the one which is used less, never gives a problem while the one in constant use is really bothersome.

Consider your options before purchasing. Good value for money but the printer's  far from perfect.",2,8.459377

In other words, it's a clamp that is fully adjustable to fit most cubicle walls and the jacket hanger flips down when you need to use it and when you aren't using it you can flip it back closed so it's not sticking out. Now it only sticks out a tiny bit so you won't bump it accidentally even when it's open because it's very compact but effective. I also love that it is VERY sturdy, it's not plastic and won't break if you hang a heavy leather jacket on it, it's a tough hook.

With these specific folders, I like the matte texture very much.

The best thing of all about this kind of folder is that you can see what's in the file without opening it. Overall, 100x better than manila folders.

If you've not used these before, they hold up to about 40-50 sheets of 8.5""x11"" paper, but probably work best with fewer pages.

The first thing I did when I got this item is to open the box and read the instructions. That didn't take long at all, which I guess is a good thing although I was expecting more. The thing is, it is so simple to use that there really is no need for a lot of instructions.  One reviewer posted a video review which, although it was for the larger Quasar model (I have the Pulsar E300), the basic information is the same only that one has higher capacity.

The machine itself is rock-solid. It is heavy, with good build/construction quality. This is no lightweight, flimsy thing, it is meant for long-term use. You simply punch the pages - the motor is sturdy enough to easily handle 15 pages. Someone mentioned doing 20 but that's stretching it.  Then you punch the covers, line everything up, put in the comb binder and it's done. It is really quite simple and the machine does an excellent, quality job.  It was also engineered in a thoughtful and efficient manner, with a storage tray underneath for the binders that also serves as a measurement tray to determine the size of comb you need, and with another tray for the punchouts from the paper.

A starter set of comb bindings and covers comes with the machine.  All in all it is a well-thought out product and is of high quality.  It will certainly get the job done and ought to last a long time, too.  A few years ago our office purchased a different sort of binding machine, one that fuses the paper together with glue but it was limited as far as how many pages you could use and also not as user-friendly. Plus some pages would inevitably fall out if you used more than just a few.  This comb binder is much more versatile and user-friendly.",13,8.585517

The quick flip of the eraser is handy for when you are in a hurry and don't want to stop and clean it. I just flip the eraser and voila, a clean eraser appears. The pencil line is smooth and easy. It isn't too sharp to cut into paper, which I hate. It also isn't too choppy, and it doesn't leave too light of a line, which is what some other brands I have had problems with, but not with these. I love the pencil grips at the ends to make it easy to hold. Another gripe I have is mechanical pencils are so hard to hold on to since the shell is usually thin and made with slick plastic, but these are very easy to hold to and are a little more wider like a normal pencil.

The leads seems fairly firm. I have only broke two leads, but I was getting pretty aggressive with it, so that was my doing. It takes a good amount of pressure to break the lead. The colors of the pencil shells is not the greatest, unless you like that funky 80s look, but I really couldn't care, I am not out to impress with what my pencils look like. I do like the blue one though. It comes with twelve more leads on top of the ones already in the pencils. Each pencil has its own eraser plus it also has two extra erasers, which are really four, since the erasers have two ends that flip. It has the usual push the pen's eraser top to bring down the lead too.

These are everything I am looking for in a mechanical pencil. Oh and they are awesome for crossword puzzles too. I have decided I am going to buy these in the future. I couldn't find anything wrong with them and am a new convert myself to these fine set of pencils.",2,5.8996944

I'm a refuge from the HP ""Instant Ink"" program.  Instant Ink Program?  Well, think of it as something like a cross between Jonestown and the Luchese crime syndicate of lore.  Basically, you sign up for regular shipments of printer ink. You get on a plan -- ""a plan.""  Love that, because my life ain't nearly complicated enough, I need to add more twists and turns by enrolling in a printer ink plan.  Anyway, the plan sends you ink cartridges that have an RFID chip (no joke!) that effectively syncs with your account.  No pay, no print -- fuggetabout if you've a brand-new ink cartridge installed.  Oh, and it's worth saying that your printer will cease to function if 1 of 4 ink cartridges is depleted.  Didn't know this?  Get with the program! Get with the plan! lol

Anyway, I'm a refuge from the Instant Ink program -- free at last!! (even if the taste of grape Kool Aid burns the back of my esophagus).  This product works (for now) -- go figure, an HP ink cartridge actually works in an HP printer!

It is nice being able to quickly look at the barrel to see how much ink remains - with the great ink capacity, it is a long time between refills! It is also a nice looking pen and a good size for my hand.

This usually allows us to go a few more weeks of light use, which is what we use our printer for anyway.  The low toner light annoyingly continues to flash so I turn off the printer at night.

4278,"Like most of the reviews on here, the main problems with this highlighter are (1) the tip wears down and gets a little inaccurate, (2) occasionally pieces flake off, and (3) they don't last very long.  I generally overlook those flaws, simply because it doesn't bleed through or transfer when you turn a page right after marking it (with the exception of those pesky flakes, which tend to get smeared onto the back of the previous page).  The thing that bothers me the most about these is that the cap doesn't always stick to the bottom while you're using it, and occasionally gets lost.  Granted, these don't dry out like a ""regular"" highlighter, but having to be careful of the end is a little annoying.  If they could figure out a way to replace the cap with a clicky-top, and still have a way to advance the ""gel"" as you use it, it would be much better.  Another slight downside is that once you highlight, it's a little hard to write over.  Will I buy them again?  Probably.

4280,"Ink cartridges are, as almost everyone knows, hugely profitable for the printer companies who have even taken refillers and imitators to court in order to perfect theier monopoly. I used to buy third-party cartridges - and destroyed an Epson printer with a bad cartridge. The vendor, whom I purchased from before, basically disclaimed responsibility.

 Since then I use only ink cartridges from the printer manufacturer. True, they are obscenely expensive, but I haven't lost a printer to them either.

 The HP 88XL installs in my HP printer without hassle and delivers trouble free performance. The page output quantity is easily twice as much as from the standard size cartridge.

 So, I hate paying the price, but I am getting what I pay for in this instance: lots of pages and trouble free operation.

I have added these essential items as well:

- Foot hammock https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NSZUVGW/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1
- Foot cushion https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MS6XW8/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1

I currently don't use my yoga matting / standup desk matting with this chair, its unecessary

This chair fits perfectly on the treads of my treadmill

It makes it very easy to get on and get off my treadmill desk

What's great is now I can have almost any position while on my desk

- I can walk at a casual working pace of 1.6mph
- I can casually walk at 2.6 mph while working
- I can jog at 4 mph
- I can stand
- I can stand while leaning on my foot hammock
- I can stand on my foot cushion while bracing backwards
- I can sit on my chair, on my foot hammock
- I can sit on my chair, with feet propped up on the brace of my desk
- I can have one left hanging to the left supported by my wireshelves
- Same with right leg
- I can twist my body left and look right at my table
- same with other side
- I can lean backand forward like a bosu ball
- I can incorporate any amount of elbow supports I want while leaning on my desk

The list goes on and on. I could probably name about 10 other positions but I will stop here.
My back would normally tire from standing too long, and sometimes I just don't feel like walking when I'm really trying to concentrate

The number of ergonomic functions on this chair is nice

it adjusts, but since I'm standing, i leave it at the max height alotted.

Weighs like 25 lb so I can pick it up with one hand and move it to the side, and then throw my foot cushion on top of it, then proceed to walk on my treadmill desk

4282,"There are a number of glaring issues with how this notebook is structured.

1. The elastic band is anchored to the back cover with metal rivets/anchors, which creates a non-flat back cover.  There are two distinct bulges when trying to write on the right side of the notebook, which will become more and more noticeable as you get to the end of the notebook.  But there are issues with getting to the end of the notebook, because...

2. The notebook doesn't lay flat.  The notebook features a good number of pages, but requires a hand to hold the notebook in-place if you plan on writing lengthy entries.  I imagine if this was used as a random thoughts notebook instead of a journal, it will be better.

3. The paper is pretty awesome -- smooth and thick, with no bleed through or ghosting even for fountain pens.  But wet inks do not dry quickly on this paper, so you'll need to keep the book open or have a separate sheet inside to shield the opposite side of the notebook to dry the ink.

Overall, the notebook is fine.  It is pretty sturdy for being a softcover, and the paper is of really high quality.  I'd just temper my expectations to use this as a long-term journal.  If Clairefontaine can offer this in blank pages rather than college ruled, I think that'd expand the usability of these will increase.",18,12.626145

I didn't want me (or the little ones I teach) getting hurt on the sharp corners that inevitably show up when you laminate anything. It works like a dream for that, but I have also found many other uses for it. For example, I made little diplomas for my group of preschoolers I taught and rounding the corners made them look that much more professional. It easily cuts through the laminated sheets.

Great for layering and using with your fine art projects, illustrations, crafting, scrap booking, and stamping. The sketch markers have two nibs, the standard chisel nib and the brush nib with makes it perfect for blending and brush lettering. Sketch markers are refillable, the nibs are replaceable, and they can be used with the Copic airbrush system. The ink here should fill a sketch marker up to 12 times and a ciao marker up to 15 times. Simply remove the chisel nib and slowly drop the ink into the sponge inside the barrel until it no longer absorbs.

Unfortunately, the lines in both the squared moleskines are too dark.  They are noticeably darker than the lines in the ruled moleskine (I compared them very closely to ensure that my analysis was correct).  Indeed, the lines are so dark that it's difficult to read what is written in black pen.  The only upside is that if someone is trying to read what you've written, over your shoulder, they will have a difficult time doing so.

This is unfortunate, because my friend's squared moleskine (which he purchased ""several years ago"") has lines that are much lighter in color, like the lines which appear in the ""ruled"" moleskines.  I'm guessing that I had a bum production batch, or they've amended the product from its previous form.

Also, with the squared moleskine, the lines are too close together.  They are closer together than the lines in the ""ruled"" moleskines.  This makes it difficult to write quickly if you're writing one line of text per line.  You have to write so small that it's difficult to keep up your writing speed.

This is a great pen for signing documents and when you feel bold and want the line of your handwriting (remember that-LOL) to reflect your feeling.

Don't get me wrong, it's not like a marker, but it's a visible line.
I often love and have oodles of 3mm and 5mm lines, but this is bolder than a Flair pen for example and just feels good in your hands.  The pen has a classic, artsy, yet simple design.  I am never ashamed to pull it out in public.  It's got style.

4318,"My nephew who has a recent degree in computer engineering and works with them every day agreed to help set this up for me.  I was intrigued by the small, all in one capabilities.  Being an engineer he wrote me a long and detailed review that will hopefully help others.  He spent about two hours trying to get the printer working wirelessly with a  Chromebook and still was not successful.
Setup
The message on the HP help website is not helpful: ""At this time, we don't support setting up from this device/OS. But we have other ways to help. Did you know that you can complete setup with your smartphone or tablet?""
The generic stereotypical that many people will not be able to complete setup of this printer on their own, much less on a Chromebook.
Another device with internet access is required to complete set up.
If you plan to attach it to your home network, there is basically nothing in the immediate instructions saying ""connect to the embedded web server (EWS), then reconfigure it for your network, and then re-connect to it from your regular network""
I may have overlooked it, but nowhere did I see the ""default IP address"" to search for the EWS on the printer, I just made an educated guess - one that Joe Public might think of doing and could probably look up, but it was not obvious to me.
Mechanically:
It is nice and light.
The paper catch tray feels cheap (easily breakable if moved much)
The feed tray doesn't hold a lot of paper and it will have to be filled often
The paper feeds from the back of the printer which makes it have a bigger footprint than necessary - it would be better if it fed and returned to the front.
I did not try to get scanner/copier stuff working it took two hours to get this far!

Audibly
It is fairly quiet as far as printers go.

Software
It looks like it has the same features that a lot of HP Web Enabled / Wireless printers do.  I have not tried them, but there was evidence for it in setup. I got an HP 8610 Printer last year that has these features also and I am very pleased with it.
Google Cloud Print
Email to the printer to print (after registration from HP)
Some features would not be available on Chromebooks - or not easily implemented
e.g. Scan to computer (or equivalently, scan to Google Drive), etc.
Having zero immediately indicative support for Chromebook is believable due to the relatively small number of Chromebooks compared with Mac and Windows OSs, but it's still silly. That message saying ""we don't support setup from this device"" is stupid and there needs to be at least a ""Here are some options for trying to set up your printer with a Chromebook.""  As it was, I never completed set up and will have to come back and try again.",4,9.764547

1. Perfect fit for our Brother printer
2. Much cheaper than a replacement printer

Cons:
1. Not really a con, but the box for the Drum was labeled ""Toner Cartridge"", which was a bit confusing.

Summary:
Perfect fit, excellent toner quality.  The toner and the drums were all individually wrapped and packed in specialized bubble wrap.  All the boxes were labeled ""Toner Cartridge"", which was mildly amusing.  The drum was in the larger box.  There were no instructions included, but the process is pretty self explanatory and nothing a few minutes on Google couldn't fix.",10,6.928705

-No odor whatsoever. I have a sensitive nose, and I cannot smell anything when using these markers.

CON:
-Marker does not wipe off of my board. I have to use a wet paper towel. If I attempt to use a dry sponge or paper towel, it completely smudges and leaves residue. I guess that's the trade off unfortunately.

4327,"Overall, I'm pleased with this printer, but I have a few reservations.  First of all, this ""All-in-one"" lacks fax capability; something that many people might not need, but I consider it a must for an ""All-in-one.""  All in one for this printer means that you can scan documents and photos, and use it as a copy machine as well as a printer for your computer.

The other main issue is that there is a bug in the printer driver such that if you have set your default duplexing option to automatic, then you will get an unusual error if you try to print from the photo paper tray.

There are some nice pluses for this printer:

1) You can do quite a bit without having to have it connected to a computer:  You can plug in your camera to a USB port in front, you can plug a memory card from your camera, or plug in a USB drive.  You can then select what pictures to print using the nice LCD screen on the control panel.  The software did a pretty good job at scaling some unusual sized images I threw at it.  From the control panel you can choose what paper tray to print from, and what size prints you want.

You can also print ""Printable Forms"" from the control panel, such as grocery lists, to-do lists, music notation, and tic-tac-toe grids!

2) Two paper trays; one for photo paper (46 or 57), another for 811 paper.  No more having to empty the paper tray and put a few sheets of photo paper in, then swap them back out when finished printing photos.  You can check paper levels and ink levels from either the LCD control panel, or from the status monitor on your computer.

3) Printing speed is similar to my current printer, a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lexmark-X7350-All-in-one/dp/B000EA0DFI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lexmark X7350 All-in-one</a>.  A typical page took 25 seconds to print in normal mode; best mode was a little slow; 50 seconds. There is a built-in auto-duplexing feature which is quite nice, so you can automatically print two-sided pages without having to switch paper half-way through.  Just be cautious about setting that mode to be the default; you will have to turn it off to be able to print to the photo paper tray.

4) The LCD control panel can be positioned at an angle, or vertically, making it easy to see if you have your printer above your monitor.

5) You have several options to connect the printer to your computer; you can use WiFi, a USB cable (not included!), or Ethernet.  I tested the Ethernet connectivity and it worked just fine.  You need to install the printer driver software on all the computers you will be using with the printer.

Some drawbacks:

1) The included software ""Kodak Home Center"" uses custom dialogs for browsing for pictures, using very skinny scroll bars, making it a little frustrating to navigate around.  Also the software tends to grab the cursor at times, making it hard to use other programs.  The printer status tray application is always running when running the Home Center software, you can right-click on it and choose Exit, but it comes right back.

2) Initial setup (unpacking and setting up, and installing the software) takes a while.  Also, it takes about 30 seconds for the printer to start up when you turn on the power.",6,7.8077693
4328,"In trying these for review, I used them for a mixed class of adults with children.  Children are notoriously hard on sticky nametags, yet these stayed on very well.  Even after a couple of them removed and restuck them in different places on their clothes, during which the tags pick up fibers from the clothing which would usually cause them to fall off after reapplying, these kept on sticking!

I found great results with adults also.  The toughest fabrics for nametags to stay on, I find, is flowy nylon and shiny/silky/satiny - women's blouses that are made from these tend to be quite problematic.  But these Avery badges stayed on without even a curling corner!

They peel off incredibly well, also, no tearing in half when being pulled from the corner, thanks to the slightly plastic-y nature of the material these are made from.

My only complaint is a general one that applies to all printable labels.  It bothers me that no matter what I've done, I still end up with the printing slightly off-center, either side-to-side or top-to-bottom.  It never fails to print slightly off, and I've tried several printers with the same results.  I hope to someday find a solution to this issue.

Other than that, these name badges are great, and I highly recommend them.",10,5.768477

4330,"I have read the recent 5 star reviews and unfortunately can't agree! LD is virtually the same as 123 Inkjets. But that's not the real issue. I also have used their products in the past with OK results. Colors aren't real bad, but I don't use it for serious photography and do photos only rare occasion with no high expectations.

I have purchased about 4 of these cartridges along with color on separate occasions. I have been plagued with grey vs. black outputs. Most reconditioned cartridges can at least do a charcoal grey, but these aren't even up to that standard. I have called customer support when one newly unpackaged cartridge refused to work. They were pretty good on support and told me to bang and shake the cartridge which did work for one, but failed for another. They were quick to replace it but the output is still grey and worse, streaking as though these were dried up from sitting on someone's shelf for an extended amount of time.

What I did find is if you use a ""quality"" setting without fast-speed, you may be much happier. In my case, I do a lot of research and reprint of text articles, do documents, etc. where this becomes a major reproduction problem. If the print is rather small, the streaking will diminish the ability to read the document.

So, after trying this over and over, 1 star is all I can pull out of it and will not be purchasing any more cartridges from either of these companies.",2,8.506376
4331,"I actually happen to have a regular ""hot"" aka thermal laminator at home, so I was able to do a side by side comparison.  My thermal laminator uses pouches up to legal size, which might limit its use as compared to a roll lamintor, but it's never been an issue for me.

Anyway...
The cost of purchasing a small to medium use thermal pouch laminator versus this heat free system is nearly the same.  No substantial cost difference there. However, the cost of the laminate material they use is radically different.  You could buy Three Hundred 9"" x 11.5"" pouches and One Hundred index card pouches, both in 5 mil (the thick laminate material) for the cost of One 90-foot roll of 5 mil laminate material for this heat-free system.  (A difference of about 200 feet of material.)

So, for cost effectiveness, this Scotch Heat-Free system isn't the way to go.

Since you could potentially laminate something that was 17 feet long, this heat-free system does have a leg-up there.

BUT, as nearly every other reviewer has noted, once you get a wrinkle in this heat-free system, it's there for the rest of the roll.  With pouches, if you get a wrinkle or an air bubble, run it again with a new pouch.

And thermal systems have motors to pull the material through.  With this system, you have to crank it.  So unless you need to laminate things during a power outage, the convenience factor goes to thermal systems.

I found this thing rather unfriendly to deal with.  There are too many thing that you need to worry about: lining up the paper perfectly, watching for wrinkles, the laminate material sticking to the machine...

My personal experience with both systems makes a traditional hot laminator the clear winner.",5,8.818249

4341,"My old black and white laser printer finally gave out so I went on the hunt for a new one.  I was surprised to find this Xeron PHASER 6500/N in the price range that it was in.  After reading every review I could find I decided to give it a try.

The unit is big, it is sitting next to a 24"" LCD monitor and it is just about as tall.  It is also very heavy, for a printer, clocking in at about 75lbs to make sure you do not hurt yourself trying to move it!

The quality has been exceptional after I learned one important thing.  Changing the paper type in the software on my PC did NOT change the settings on the printer for that job.  I was printing out a photo on glossy paper and was getting horrible output with the toner not sticking to the paper even though I had chosen the glossy stock in the software.  Once I manually adjusted it on the machine itself (not hard to do) the prints looked excellent.

If you want it for photo prints keep in mind that I have yet to find any photo laser paper that is heavy enough stock to feel like a professional 8x10.  What is used here is glossy brochure stock, so the paper is quite a bit thinner.  Once the picture is behind glass though, you really can't notice it so it will depend on what your needs are.

The machine is fed by 4 toner cartridges so you can replace each color as it is needed.  I've yet to use any third-party replacements so I'm not sure how they compare to the Xerox toner.  I can say that with the Xerox toner the colors that I get out of the machine are truly amazing for the price point.  Photos look great as do multi-color brochures or letterheads.

4355,"The eraser texture is firm. It is harder to break this eraser than other eraser sticks I've used. The eraser material is very long lasting. I had a stick last for at least 5 years without needing a refill. (of course lifespan varies by how much it is used, but for me that was how long it lasted.) The thin erasers are useful for drawing and cleaning up detailed sketches. Unlike softer erasers, they don't shed as much when being used. They also don't crack apart like the softer eraser sticks. This adds to their longer lifespan. Also these are retractable and the barrel is sealed off on the sides. No gunk can get in and spoil the eraser (unlike other eraser sticks). Very handy for carrying around to places. They seem very secure even if they get loose in a bag.

Warning: Use these lightly, if pressed too hard they can wear away at the surface of the paper. On the same token, they can also rub off mistakes that softer erasers may not do as easily. I like to use both these and the softer kinds for cleaning up pencil sketches.
-------------------------
A tip on how to get the eraser to retract:  Hold the tip against a firm surface or your hand. Press in on the top part as if to pump more eraser out. Press in. The eraser will retract, provided just a little is out.  I also do this trick to mechanical pencils.

Also note this eraser is for graphite pencils. if you're looking for ways to remove colored pencil, there are other tricks. This eraser may be able to rub off some of it if you colored very lightly. (softer types like prismacolors much less likely.) But if not, you'll need to either scrape off that area or find a way to cover over it.",2,8.372347
4356,"As the other reviewers have noted, this is a very good, very fast, ""work horse"" printer.  However, the wireless setup as well as the wired setup are needlessly complicated.  I was forced to call customer support twice in order to get it working.  In this day and age, printers should be ""plug and play"" when it comes to networking.  I flat out gave up on the wireless option and even with a CAT V network connection it still took an hour on customer support to get it going.  However, to their credit, the customer support team did solve the problem and get the printer up and running.  This printer, without the support, would not even rate one star.  I am giving it four stars because of the great customer support but with the caveat that it is a needlessly complicated setup.
Update: this printer is nothing but trouble.  It goes down every month because of the needlessly complicated networking on it.  You have to call tech support (which is awful) and spend an 1 1/2 hours every month to get it working again.  Completely ridiculous.

A pack of ten letter sized 3-mil pouches.
Weak instructions.

This laminator supports three different thicknesses of pouches:

You can also use smaller pouches for smaller items, like photos or tags.

When you turn on the power, you select either ""cold"" mode (for self-adhesive laminating) or hot.  If you select hot, you have to pick either 3 mil, 4 mil, or 5 mil.  After that, it takes the laminator about 5-6 minutes to warm up.  Once it's warmed up, you feed the top of your page into the laminator and it automatically rolls the page through the device.

The result is a nice smooth page with no bubbles or delamination.

This is definitely a handy item to own.  It's much cheaper than going down to the local office supply store to have them laminate your page for you.  And if you buy the consumables in bulk (100), your cost is somewhere around $.20-$.30 per sheet.  That's not too bad, especially when you consider that these types of work or school projects usually pop up at night, and who wants to go out late at night just to pay a fortune to laminate their kid's pages?",26,9.873512
4360,"Do not buy this printer. It's fine until you have one black ink cartridge empty (there are 2 black cartridges) and the printer shuts down totally because it has to have all cartridges full before it will function. So ridiculously stupid. With my old printer I could print something in blue if that's the only cartridge full, but no not on the workforce. I am so angry and have to wait to buy one black cartridge with 4 FULL CARTRIDGES presently - including a full black cartridge to be able print. STUPID!",5,6.562552
4361,"I purchased this as a present for my wife to hold her knitting patterns. Since both pictures on the product show the board on a stand, I made the mistake of believing it was part of the product.

This is very simply a 8x10 piece of steel (with very sharp edges) and a few magnets. There is no stand and the product even cautions you to cover the edges of the board with masking tape to protect yourself.

4362,"Buyer beware.  Have bought this cartridge for years without issue but something has changed with the product.  In August of 2014, plugged in a new LD-793-5 cartridge into the PB mailer.  It would not print a test pattern.  Eventually had to call PB for service work on the mailing machine.  Of course the tech claimed the problem was using after-market ink.  Again, I've had success for years with LD ink.  So he cleaned the machine, changed the print head and installed a PB cartridge.  That cartridge lasted until middle of 2/15.  Installed new LD cartridge - bought 2 on 9/14 to have as back stock.  Installed the new LD cartridge 2/15.  There was nothing I could do to make the 1st work.  Ok fine.  I open the second, given the cost, no big deal.  2nd will not work either - a blurred or partially missing test pattern - plus a number of prints on envelopes that eventually required old-school stamps - what a waste.  Consulted LD's website - none of their solutions helped.  Tried to return via Amazon - but they only back the product for 30-days  - even though the box from LD says ""100% Satisfaction Guaranteed"".  So went back to Amazon and found a seller of PB ink - ouch - $75 - but less than the $90 through PB.  When it arrived, plugged it in and the machine has run perfect since.  Contacted LD directly via their website - told them the story and was only asking to swap the cartridges that don't work for replacements and I was willing to ship the bad one's back for their QC people to review.  I was very politely no thank you and to have a nice day.",2,7.6683803
4363,My wife and I print a lot of papers (she is a teacher and prints a lot at home) and I found that I was buying ink quite frequently. I figured I would buy the larger size and see if I could save some money by buying ink less often.

I have a heavy laptop, so they either tip, cant hold position or overheat my pc.
This is everything I dreamed the other would be.  It is heavy duty and well designed. It has every possible position I need, tall, flat, angled.  Each position adjustment is locked in that place until you unlock it.  It is wide enough without taking up the whole bed.  The holes on the bottom vent your laptop so it doesnt overheat.  It also comes with a attachable mouse stand, but I can't figure out how to put it on and don't need it, so I threw that away.

This holder has kind of a faux alligator surface and the silver color is really pretty.  It's really well made and it has a magnetic closure so it stays shut.  I had another holder that didn't stay shut very well and the cards would fall out in my purse and end up getting bent and looking bad, so I much prefer this case.

UPDATE: These no longer work ... at all. The bottom of them which is supposed to keep the bookends from sliding is coming off. They don't stand up straight.

4375,"The Stained by Sharpie Brush Tip Fabric Markers are a fun craft project for children.

These markers are meant to write on fabric.  The brush tip is awkward at first, but really works well once you figure out exactly how much pressure you need to exert when using them.  The tips make respectable lines and the brush enables you to fill in larger spaces more easily.  Writing on fabric with markers has never been (and probably never will be) and exact science.  These markers make it easier, but given the texture of your average cotton tee shirt, it takes a little practice to get the best results.

On the very positive side, there was very little bleeding on a 100% cotton tee.  Additionally, the markers kept going for quite some time, without drying up or running out of ink.

As far as the performance in the long run, it is best to run your art project through the drier for 10 to 20 minutes at a higher setting before wearing or washing.  This seems to dry and set the ink the best.  Still, after a few washes the ink definitely starts to fade.  The darker colors (black and blue) seem to hold on the longest whereas yellow and pink seemed to fade a bit faster.  As you might suspect, these worked best on a white or very light colored tee.  Darker colors definitely will make it harder to see your art project and may change the colors a bit.

Still, the kids had a blast!  This is great fun for a rainy day and it's always nice to have something like this in your back pocket when you need a good indoor project.  Recommended.",2,8.126858

4377,"I have to admit that this printer scared me right out of the box.  It had been such a long time since I had purchased a new printer that my old one still hooked up to the computer through one of those big printer cables that have gone the way of wired mouses.  I had a feeling that the directions on this contraption would probably speak heavily of cables and software using terms that I had yet to learn.  I was so intimidated by the thought of it that I enlisted the help of a neighbor that well understands this stuff much better then myself.  As it turns out, I really feel that with a couple of exceptions where I was a little nervous, I could have easily gotten this thing up and running on my own.  Hard wiring this printer is a snap.  With the exception of the directions insisting on calling the USB cable the power cable or something or other, it really is as simple as following the directions provided.  And that holds true even with the fact that my printer is wired into a very old desktop computer simply acting as a host for the series of laptops we have in the house.  After we set up the wireless connection, (that I swear went as easily as described in the directions) it was just a matter of setting up the laptops to find and recognize the juice now flowing through the house.  In just under and hour I was enjoying wireless printing from my laptop in one room, and hearing it quietly process in another.  Simply wonderful.  Make no mistake about it, this baby has not become a victim of all the downsizing that is going on in the electronics business these days.  It has the look and feel of being a throw back to an era when electronics had enough heft to them that you actually felt you were getting your moneys worth.  Some other reviewers have stated some irritation or surprise at this units size.  But in all honestly, unless you are talking about a situation where space is a premium, it shouldn't be a concern in my opinion.  Actually, I think it looks right handsome all lit up and ready for action.  It's truly a fine all in one machine that has the look and feel of true quality to it. It's actually been some time since I have been so satisfied with something as new and intimidating as this.

In conclusion, I must confess that as of the time of this writing, I have not as of yet tried out the FAX part of this model.  I have printed with it and used the scanner, but have no need yet of the FAX.  I had never used a scanner before.  But once again following the directions with a little patience had me becoming comfortable with it in less than 30 minutes.  If my satisfaction with this machine changes any in regards to the fax, I will certainly be back to report it.  There is no question that one can get a printer for a lot less money than buying this piece.  Even an all in one model can be had for cheaper than this Canon model.  However I feel that the quality look and feel of this baby, along with the flawless performance it is producing, well justifies the  higher price.  If I had run into any problems with the set up and operation of this model, I would pass them on in ragards to any and all advice and experience.  But truthfully I did not.  I am very happy with this all in one printer, and I highly recommend buying it right here on Amazon...",15,7.1060944

FYI, it comes with screws and double-stick tape for hanging (you choose the method). I tried using the screws, but I'd really need an anchor to make them stay in the wall. The double-stick tape worked like a charm though. Just be sure to hold it in place for a good 30 seconds to a minute to ensure good adhesion to the wall.",11,3.5271547
4379,"In 2016 our government supply system delivered our desk calendars near the end of August.  Having heard that we'd be in a similar situation this year, I just bought myself one of these for about six bucks.  Considering there are 12 months in the year, that's only 50 cents a month. Sweet!  Incredibly, the calendars ordered through supply cost nearly thirty dollars each and probably won't get here until the end of Summer.  Your tax dollars at work!

There is plenty of space on each day to write appointments, birthdays, or other information as needed.  A three line note section at the top gives you some space to write, and the full year mini-calendar at the bottom lets you look ahead without flipping pages.

I'd suggest picking one of these up. Especially if you're waiting on a goverment agency to deliver a calendar sometime later this year.

It's still usable with the creases--it just doesn't look as nice.  (The one from the teacher supply store was rolled, not folded, so I didn't have this issue.) It has one nice feature--small weights are sewn into the bottom hem to help it hang flat.

Pocket charts are useful for all kinds of things.  You don't have to hang them on a special rack--you can just pin them on the wall with thumbtacks.  Ours holds a monthly calendar (made from colorful sentence strips,) a job chart, the cursive letters of the month, and the multiplication facts of the week.  You can use them for spelling words or a daily schedule as well.  Kids seem to like using them--my kids enjoy changing out the calendar each month.

4386,"Sharpie makes great pens, and these are excellent! I absolutely love this pen! Before I got my first Sharpie Pen, I worried that it would just be another Sharpie marker. But, it doesn't look at all like a marker when you use it. The writing really looks like a pen. If you look really closely, the tip still looks like a marker, but I think they use special ink and a process to get it to look almost exactly like pen writing and not marker writing.

When I first saw that it was ""no bleed,"" I didn't believe it. Plus, I thought they were talking about how substandard pens will leak all over your fingers. When I was doing crossword puzzles on an airplane, with a ballpoint pen, then I'd always get leaky pen ink all over my fingers. I'm happy to report that this pen fulfills its promises, and doesn't bleed. It both doesn't bleed through the paper, and it doesn't get all over my hands when I'm doing crossword puzzles, even on an airplane.

It's extremely comfortable, lightweight, and doesn't take up much space. This feels so nice to write with and draw with, too. My only negative comment is that Sharpie makes three versions of these pens, and I actually like the one that looks the least like a pen the best.

Pros: prints fast, very sensitive touch screen

  Didn't see my wi-fi network, so I had to manually enter SSID and password. Got connected in seconds.
  Does not loose wi-fi connection and it is very stable, no problems at all. Starts to print even in stand by mode.
  Great quality scans.
  Prints from mobile device easily and scans, too.
  Scans directly to cloud, google drive, dropbox, folder on the PC etc.
  Most important the print quality is excellent! I wouldn't expect it to be better to be honest. I like it!

Cons: Very noisy, though there is a quiet mode option but it slows down the printing speed.
  Very poor plastic materials, they look very cheap with uneven colors of black. Well it is cheap. To be honest I was expecting bad quality because of its looks but don't forget not to judge the book by its cover.
I've also compared the print quality to the HP P2035 and Brother doesn't print as good. P2035 has darker and fatter print quality.

Research is done, reviews are read, and naturally the focus is on the quality of print, functions, reliability, etc. Often questions like ""how long will my ink last and how much will it cost to replace it ?"" are forgotten. In my opinion this is a big mistake as the actual cost of buying the printer turns out to be minimal compared to the amount that you will spend over the years on ink replacement. The manufacturers know that once you have their printer they have effectively 'got you', basically they can charge astronomical amounts for replacing ink because you have no choice but to buy it. That is why companies (like Epson) make there printers very sensitive to other makes of ink, they know that ink can be produced at a fraction of the cost but want to ensure that you have to buy from them. I can't speak for other makes of printers but this has certainly been the case with my Epson printer and I would never buy anything from Epson again. The ink cartridges only last a short time and to replace are very expensive, even on Amazon. A couple of other negative practices are firstly; a lot of their printers will not work if just one of their cartridges runs out. So for example if your 'Cyan' runs out it may not matter too much as you only want to print in black & white. Unfortunately the printer won't let you just use the black ink until you have replaced the other colour. Secondly, and in my opinion the most scandalous; when you purchase an Epson printer it will (as it states) come with ink. What you don't realise however is that the ink cartridges are specially made and only contain a tiny amount of ink just to get you started. So you are almost immediately digging your hands in your pockets and giving them more money. This kind of sums up where Epson are in relation to their customers, although I suspect other manufacturers are working along the same lines. And there is no law against them doing this, or no regulations for them to state ink cartridge costs or how long they last. My advice would be as follows; avoid buying an Epson, include the aforementioned aspects when doing your buying a printer research and finally, printer owners should use 'word of mouth' to bring into the open the hidden costs of running their printers be it positive or negative. Only that way, when reputations are being affected, will the companies stop using their customers as 'Cash Cows'.",7,14.161035

I use the same pens in red and green, too, with the same great results.  My only complaint would be they have a thin barrel and with arthritic hands and carpal tunnel syndrome that's kind of tough.  So I use pen grips and that takes care of it.",3,5.77798
4408,"Well, I tried one of the Kum branded ones a while back and it came so dull that it literally did not work. One of my friends convinced me that this Palomino branded one is the real deal. I was skeptical because it's still a Kum product with Kum blades. I was sold when I first tried this Palomino one -- no more forcing my pencils into a death grip and repeatedly snapping graphite until a quarter of the pencil is gone. It worked so much better than the first one I bought. Pretty much an instant sharpen. Life was good.

Then disaster struck. After less than fifteen days, going through what I estimate to be about 30 rounds of sharpening, this thing has completely quit. It won't sharpen the wood unless I grind the pencil in really hard and it just barely shaves the graphite with maximum pressure. After a few tries at that, it has gotten to the point where it isn't working at all.  I tried tightening the screws because I thought they might have come loose. No dice. The only thing that worked is switching out with the two included, replacement blades. I am not going to keep this worthless wad of plastic. What will I do when the replacement blades wear out in another ten days? You can't even buy these blades in bulk. I find it a little bizarre as well that these blades both dulled this badly at the exact same time. You would think the graphite side would have held out a bit longer.",2,8.540223
4409,"These Scotch Single-Sided Laminating Sheets are ""just what the doctor ordered""!

I shouldn't admit it, but every April I copy my friend's new Mah Jongg game sheet.  If I left it as it comes out of the copier, even something as tiny as a spot of water would ruin the copy.  The ink would smear all over.  These laminating sheets are the perfect solution!  I laminate just the top side of the paper, and it becomes impenetrable to water, coffee, and even greasy, moist fingertips don't smudge the print.

I also have laminated business cards, my Medicare card, and many photos.  These sheets work perfectly on all of them!  There is a grid on the backing paper, making it quite easy to keep your lines straight. Just cut to size, leaving a 1/4 inch margin on each side of the card or photo, remove the backing, and lay on your card or photo, making certain to press the laminating sheet evenly and smoothly.  Yes, occasionally I do get an air bubble, but most of the time the sheets go on perfectly.  I've used them for years and just replaced my first box!

The laminating sheet itself is thick enough to protect, yet thin enough not to be bulky.  I'm very pleased with my purchase of these Scotch Single-Sided Laminating Sheets and would recommend them highly.

4/5/18 Update:  Well darn!  I just opened the package once again and discovered that four of the six laminating sheets left have no removable top strip!  I can't get the backing off no how.

A KUM Long Point sharpener is 19mm. Attached photo shows points made by the Kum Wood and other sharpeners for comparison. The lead is left with irregular nicks in it. It was clunky while twisting with a snag -- on premium quality pencils. The wood is raw and not coated; as a result, the graphite stains the wood and looks like crud.

Line quality is exceptional - you can easily get nice even lines with a bit of practice.  They do have one problem.  While great for lines, they do sometimes show an uneven quality when filling in such things as floral petals in landscapes or squares in abstracts.  However, this seems to be the nature of the beast for gel pens in general and fine tipped gel pens in particular - often if you carefully reapply the pigment you can eliminate this problem.  Use a very light hand for this so you don't dig streaks into your work.  The ink dries fairly quickly, though not as quickly as the metallic pens.  I've had no problem with smearing however.

While better than a cheap ballpoint click pen, it was a bit disappointing as my first pen ""splurge"".  I also don't like the broader stroke of the tip - I would have preferred a more fine point, but I'm finding that Lamy only sells one type of refill for this pen.

4435,"Update 6/30/06: The rebate did finally show up, but it took a month longer than promised!

The printer still works and I've applied patches that probably fix the setup bug below. Brother's web site and patch software distribution is very hard to figure out, but this really has been a great purchase over time. I regularly fax from it, copy from it, scan from it, and even print from it. My wife, who was quite skeptical about the value of this complex beast (she's usually right to be skeptical) is a huge fan.

An OS X update broke the abiity to send a scan to OS X. I didn't fuss with this as it ended up being just as easy for me to launch the scan from OS X. I'm not sure this works that well with XP either -- today's firewalls make this hard.

I gave this a 3 star rating originally, but now I'd say 5 stars.

-------- Original review ----------------------
I have both XP and OS X Tiger (10.4.2) machines on my home LAN. I installed the brother to both machines. In both cases I downloaded the very latest software patches from Brother's site.

The XP install went rather well, but I realized too late the downloaded drivers didn't include the OCR s[...] Annoying. I'd recommend doing the CD install first then downloading and updating from the downloads.

The OS X install was another story. Actually, this is pretty outrageous. Bonjour (was Rendezvous) install didn't work at all. The printer didn't appear in my network display.

It took about a half hour of late night hacking and googling and amazon review reading to figure out that Brother misconfigured the printer. They didn't define something called a 'mDNS' name. Without this name Bonjour/Rendezvous doesn't work.

How do you define this? Well, to make a long story short, dig through the CD and find the help file called ALL_EngNet.pdf. Chapter 7 describes the browser interface. Use your browser and the IP address of the brother to get the web UI. You need the admin un of 'admin' and pw of 'access'. (This is publicly downloadable, not secret, you can chang pw.) Then from the home page click Network Configuration then click on configuremDNS, then name the machine (BrotherMFC works). Now you can add it as a printer.

It's astounding that Brother doesn't even mention this on their web site help files. It's a pretty darned serious bug.

I'll add the rest of my experience later. The Mac is definitely a poor cousin for this device. It does appear, however, that (contrary to the Brother specs) it is possible to fax to a Mac.

Update: I've definitely warmed to this device. I've an evolving review with comments on both XP and OS X experiences in my blog.  Amazon does not permit URL inclusion in reviews, but for more information go to Google's blog search and search Gordon and 7820N.

The XP support is better than the Mac support, but a geek armed with my review will have no trouble getting this machine working well with OS X -- including push button scanning directly to disk! (I suspect there may be some nasty security implications here ...) It's not, however, a device for the average user. It really needs a geek to install and configure it.",88,9.680757

4440,"I've been using an HP1320 laser printer for about 8 years. So far, I've gone through the original toner cartridge, which should have lasted 2500 pages, and a single Q5459X cartridge, which was supposed to have lasted 6000 pages. My printer tells me that it has printed 8722 pages, and I've just installed my second Q5459X. It was nice to find that these cartridges last for at least as long as they're supposed to. HP's estimates are just about perfect. I use my laser primarily to print text. Illustrated documents go to an inkjet printer nearby.

I've had no hitches with these toner cartridges, including the one I've just installed. I've tried the far less expensive toner cartridges on other printers and have not found the quality to be up to snuff. It's not worth it to me to save less than a penny per page if I'm going to get banding, variation in blacks among sentences, or need for more frequent replacement.

The downside, of course, is that at first glance, this price seems ridiculously high. Let's face it: you can buy a brand new HP LaserJet Pro P1606dn for just $20 more, or the P1102w for $15 less. And they include a toner cartridge. But the toner included there is a starter cartridge and you'll shortly find yourself wanting to buy a real toner cartridge. And there they are, for a slightly higher price per page than you'll find right here - the high yield cartridges aren't even available for these new printers yet. So buck up, spend the dollars up front, and you'll have your 6000 pages of high quality output. HP's printers are astoundingly reliable so I haven't yet encountered a point where I buy toner only to find that the printer no longer works.

And spend the extra dollars on the HP product. If nothing else, you'll have a reliable high-quality toner cartridge that will last a good long time.",2,10.490537

4442,"We only buy Fellowes shredders and have found them very reliable.  I originally purchased the oil for the cutters directly from Fellowes a couple of years ago; the bottle was smaller and more expensive at the time.  I was quite pleased to find this product available from Amazon at a good price and larger bottle.

I think a lot of people buy a shredder, not knowing that it does need some maintenance to keep it in top shape.  Besides not overloading your shredder's capabilities or shredding material that you shouldn't, the next best thing you can do to protect your investment is to regularly lubricate the cutters.  This reduces wear, noise, and can prevent the teeth from breaking.

Be sure to read the instructions for your particular shredder, however, about the type of oil to use and the frequency.  You may be tempted to use other types of oil you already have around your house or WD-40 or something, but many of those things are flammable and will only serve to damage your shredder or worse.

As another reviewer said, be careful when cutting the tip on the bottle because if you make it too big, the oil will be harder to control.",229,7.376524

4444,"I am so, so, so very disappointed that this scanner and software is not a viable solution for document management, digital archiving, or just clearing off my desk.  I use this for personal use and it pains me to write this, just thinking about the horror I suffer through using this product.

I've had the scanner now for a year and been using the software (and older scanners) for years so this is written with SIGNIFICANT experience.  Don't expect future products to be any better.  Just move along.

Pro's:
+ The concept is nice: get rid of your paper documents and free yourself from being buried under mounds of receipts and documents.
+ Dual-sided one-pass scanning.
+ Fairly quick scanning.
+ The scanner can actually scan the 2-foot long receipts you sometimes get at Lowe's or the grocery store.  This is one feature I like because my other MFP scanners can't do that.

Con's:
- EXPENSIVE!  Just because it costs a lot, don't expect it to work well.
- The hardware is barely passable.  Pages get scanned crooked, jams happen often, pages not pulled in to scan: it requires LOTS of manual input in care & feeding of the scanner.  It gets worse over time, so expect a honeymoon period where things initially work great.
- Can't stack multiple items well.  They jam up and then you don't know what the state is of the scanner: scan all again?  Scan up to the item?  What to do, what to do... hmm.
- Post processing of scans is SLOW!  The computer-based database frequently crashes on big scans.  Hopefully you didn't shred items until the processing is complete.
- NeatCloud subscription runs out really quick.  Pay more!  Pay more money!
- The USB-connected computer scanning requires lots of overhead input. I thought I'd solve that with NeatCloud, but really all what happens is the same files are in the cloud that need the same manual cleanup activities.  You just don't see it cause they're in the cloud vs in your software Inbox.
- If you switch the file type from 'Receipt' to 'Document', the item is rescanned by the software renderer, which locks out the software for user input.  REALLY, REALLY ANNOYING when just about every document has to be rescanned.
- Searching the database really only works with one word at a time.  Choose correctly!  No boolean operators.  Searching really gets frustrating really quick.
- Viewing the database is SLOOOOOOOOW.  At least 5 seconds to go to a new item.  When you need to review 25 items, expect this to take up to an hour.
- Deleting a page in an scan takes 5 seconds.
- Rotating a page in a scan takes 5 seconds.
- Get the picture?  Using the software QUICKLY burns up the limited time we have on this planet.
- Receipt scanning frequently gets date & company & amount wrong.  Expect to do LOTS of post cleanup work.  More time.
- There is no machine learning.  If you change item type, or change name, or change any field- expect to have to do it EVERY TIME.  The software does not learn what you do and apply that effort the next time a similar scan comes up.
- PROPRIETARY DATABASE!  I can't believe that I put so much effort into this product... and there's no way to export it to something better.  You are so screwed if you use it... BEWARE.

Others:
~ Use of this product requires a dedicated administrative assistant.  Even for home use.
~ Make sure you use quotes around any special characters or the database search will be invalid.  Imagine how annoying it would be if you had to use quotes when you use Google...
~ There's a ""new product"" listed on Amazon so Neat can now get lots of horrible reviews for the ""updated product"".  Seriously, Neat?  Give it up.
~ It's not easy to submit a feature request or report a bug.  It happens SO OFTEN that I want a quick and easy way to report issues... but you have to go through many annoying website links.  Put a direct link in the Neat app, please!  That's what will ""Help""!

Do I really need to write more?  I don't know what's worse: Neat or Quicken.  I know how desperate it can be to want to digitize... but this is not the solution.  Don't fall for the trap.  They're preying on you.",91,10.906284
4445,"Another great smash product! I love these little prompt books. If you've never seen one, well, they're little pads of papers with prompts that you can tear out, write down your thoughts, and tape or glue it into your Smash book - Scrapbook - Art Journal, etc. At first I didn't really like that there were more than one of the same prompt (usually 3 of the same prompt in one book) but now that I have several smash books and Art Journals going at the same time, mine, the family adventure one, one for the youngest, helping my middle daughter with hers...., then I can see the upside of having more than one of the same prompt. It makes sense now.

I'd seen some complaints from other reviewers talking about the clear round label that the manufacturer put on the front of the pad, then folded over the side of the pad to the back, to keep it together in shipping. The complaint is that when you tear it off, it rips the whole front cover leaving you with a mess, and lets face it, most of us with artistic abilities are a tad OCD and that would drive anyone of us crazy. And they're right, if you tear it off, that is exactly what's going to happen.

So, I didn't tear mine off. Instead I took a xacto knife, slid it through the tape in the very center of the pad (very carefully), and then folded the tape over onto the inside of the front and back covers. It was an easy way to open it, and easy way to solve the problem of ruining the front.

This is the Travel Pad - We travel a lot, so this little pad is perfect for all our adventure books! It's another reason I'm glad for 3 of the same page, because it'll last longer for all my adventure books. Plus the prompts give me ideas to make up my own prompts.

Like the others, it is smaller than a 3 x 5 note card with a perforated edge at the top, to make it easy to tear each individual page out. I'm attaching pix of the prompts because one of the hardest things I had about deciding which books to buy, was having no idea what was inside.

I am glad that I gave them another chance, this printer is better than any inkjet I have ever seen.  It prints photos super quick and I can print a large document double sided very fast.  The ADF is also great, it can scan double sided.  The ADF is not that quick, but I do not scan or copy that much.  I scanned a double sided 25 page document and it took about 5 min.  The paper tray holds half of a ream of paper, so I do have to keep putting paper in the tray.  The print heads are easy to change and they should last about 4k pages.  The ink is suppost to have a large page count, but I will have to wait and see.

4456,"This pen is amazing. The first pen I ever used was a parker vector, that was about 6-8 years ago when i was in undergrad but i loved it back then, but to be honest i did not do a lot of writing in undergrad, everything was in computers, 3-4 years ago i started using fountain pens almost exclusively as i entered med school and the cheer volume of papers/notes i write demands for a very comfortable (and fun!) instrument. I've tried everything, rolleballs, pencils, mechanical pencil, technical pens, gel pens and with only one exception (parker IM medium rollerball, but I'm not gonna talk about that here) none of those instruments come even close to the smoothness and line ""clearness"" of a half decent fountain pen (e.g. a cheap parker vector, or a pilot varsity (varsity are actually AMAZING replacement for disposable pens) but even those, as good as they are compared to the non-fountain-pen pens are in a whole different universe as this Pilot falcon.
Finally I'm done with my introduction, so what about this product in specific? Well i have 2 of these, first i got myself a rhodium trimmed extra fine nib. A substantial portion of my current writing includes filling forms with patient data, a lot of data goes into a normal page, so there is not a lot of space, i chose extra fine with the idea that maybe i could fit more in the tiny space i have available while maintaining legibility. I was successful with my approach, however the extra fine from Pilot is the finest thinest line i have ever seen on any type of wiring instrument (even a super sharp pencil), such fine nib in conjunction with the very low quality (and coarse paper) that my forms are printed on makes the writing experience a bit less enjoyable (scratchy!) than I personally would like, not terrible but not perfect either. Needless to say that i've tested this pen on much more better paper, and the difference is night and day, on good paper this is a terrific pen to write with, specially since the flexibility of this nib makes it for a nice line variation. Even without trying to flex (e.g. regular fast handwriting) you'd get some nice variation, slow your writing a tadbit and apply some pressure on the downstrokes and all of the sudden you are no longer writing but actually drawing beautiful words! And I don't even know how to flex write, I'm totally ""naive"".
Wait a minute, I said I had 2 pens, but so far I've only talked about one... Well the second one is a medium nib. Now the difference between medium and extra fine is huge. I figured that for my second i didn't want to just get a fine as it would probably be too similar to the extra fine and i figured medium would be more appropriate. Now, the difference is abysmal between extra fine and medium, i love the medium one as well, but a fine would been also fine, because i reckon it would been different enough to the extra fine to be worth it. Now, you might think that perhaps this medium is too broad... no it isn't, is medium, the big difference is because the extra fine is so fine that the medium, in comparison looks like a brush! I love this medium nib, it is super wet, and also has flex! Now, because the extra fine is so fine and also have the same flex, this means that it actually gives a higher degree of line variation as the ""thick line"" of both pens are very similar, but the ""thin line"" of the extra fine is like 5-10x thiner than the thiner line the medium can give. So if you read all about these pens being flex and thats the sole purpose you at considering buying one of these, i would probably say that if you tolerate fine nibs go for the EF or F nibs and those might give you the widest degree of variation. If you don't really care much about line variation, and just want a magnificent pen, get the medium. It won't give you earth shattering line variation but its fairly decent and the nib is so much smoother, and wetter that its simply magnificent.",4,10.994282

4461,"After using this printer for a bit I came out of it feeling really middle of the road.

It has wireless connectivity that I used and setup using WPA2 with no problems. It also scans and makes copies. There is a small but functional LCD panel, it is better than nothing. It also has a SD/SDHC/MS/MMC slot. CF and USB would have been nice but aren't included.

When you install the software it downloads and installs software and printer firmware updates if any exist.

I made some copies that came out as I would expect so I have no complaints there. I didn't really mess around with scanning as I have a dedicated scanner hooked up that has much better quality.

I have 2 other HP printers to compare prints from. One is a HP A650 and one is a HP D7500. To test I put a image on a SD card and printed directly from the card on each printer. Comparing the prints I find the color of both HP printers to be more accurate and pleasing. The Kodak's colors seem a bit off from what I see on my screen and the photos printed by the HP. The Kodak picture does seem to have more detail in it though. I am not sure if there really is or it is fooling me by sharpening the image more than the HP printers do. When I look really close it does appear there is more detail though. As an example I can see the wood grain better in the Kodak where in the HP prints the grains look blurred together. So color HP win and detail Kodak win.

I am not a heavy printer user so I cannot attest to the life of the ink cartridge yet. I am still using the included cartridges. The ink heads are not part of the cartridges but I like the fact that the ink heads are in their own piece that installs in the printer. Theoretically you should be able to replace it easily if the need ever arises.

One thing I really dislike is the paper handling of this unit. There is only a single tray so you have to change paper if you want to print 4x6 photos. I am sure it is a cost thing so you will need to decide if it matters to you. Also when the unit prints a page the printed page falls on top of the new paper in the tray. I have had the printer start to pull in a print when printing multiple pages. I stopped it before it could go all the way back in but believe it would have double printed the page had I not intervened. I wouldn't let multi-page prints happen unattended.

Overall I would say this is a OK printer if you are not looking for anything high end and are willing to live with its compromises.",2,9.146118

4473,"I have had the X551 for several months now.  I have probably made something like 100,000 prints. This is a very nice printer. It is one of the fastest printers you can buy.  I found for instance that when printing on legal-size paper in the duplex mode, I could print about 32 pages (16 sheets of paper - both sides) in 65 seconds. It's even faster with letter-size paper (see below). Your speeds will vary depending on a number of factors. This printer is also very reliable. So far, I've only had one minor paper feed problem. I love the way the paper comes out flat, rather than curled. My laser printer curls the paper. The machine is also relatively quiet, though it does make noise. You might prefer it not be running near you while you are on the phone for instance.  It has a low operating cost. My estimated ink costs per page are as low as .0143 per page, though your cost may differ for a variety of reasons.  Almost all of my printing has been with black ink only. If you routinely use color ink, your ink costs could be significantly higher.

My biggest complaint is that it does not have built-in capacity for legal-size paper. If you only do a few sheets of legal paper every now and then you can use the bypass tray. But for serious printing on legal, you will have to buy a separate tray for legal paper, and that will cost you more than some inexpensive printers. My second biggest complaint is that while it is possible to print documents directly from a thumb-drive plugged directly into the printer (this is often the speediest way to print), you don't have as much control over the printing when printing from a thumb drive. I am also annoyed that when you save the print settings for re-use, some settings seem not to be saved and will need to be reset manually for each print job.

Speed: One of the main reasons to buy this printer is because it is fast. Really fast.  It is one of the fastest inkjet printers you can buy, and beats most laser printers as well, by a wide margin. The full-page print technology is the secret. A stationary ink head the width of a page spurts ink droplets onto the page as each page sweeps under it. There is not a moving ink head jerking back and forth one line at a time as in olden days. This is the future people.

If you really want to print fast, you will need a decent computer. Otherwise, your old slow computer might slow down the print process, especially on big jobs. I use a USB cable connection. One option is to plug a thumb drive directly into the printer and print your documents directly from the thumb drive. I found that this can be dramatically faster than printing from a computer.  I found that when printing from a thumb drive on letter-size paper I could print a 202 page double-sided document in 5:12. That works out to about 1.5 seconds per side, or 3 seconds per double-sided page. That's pretty damn fast! We had to watch that the paper did not shoot off the printer as it came out of the machine. We ended up taping a piece of cardboard to the machine to help keep the paper from flying off.

Your print speed will depend on your print settings. The ""Professional"" setting will print slower than the ""General Office"" setting for instance, though both setting print faster than most other printers.  We found that the ""General Office"" setting is plenty professional for us. We are printing books.

Other speed considerations: Periodically between jobs the machine takes 90 second time-outs. A message on the touch-screen says the printer is ""preparing"". I am not sure what is really going on. This may have to do with printing big jobs. In any case, these little time-outs are an occasional annoyance. Fortunately, they are not constant or continuous.

Cost: I found that this machine was more economical to operate than some of my previous printers. My estimated ink costs range from .0143 to .0157 per print. Much of my printing is on legal-size paper and my documents are heavily illustrated with line drawings that use more ink than regular text. So your costs could be lower than mine. Also, I recently discovered that if I buy ink direct from HP, I can save money using the coupon codes that they send me. My ink costs were figured before I discovered these discounts, which can be up to 20%. On the other hand, I normally only print with black ink. If you use color ink, your ink costs could easily be more than mine.
You need to be very careful to adjust your print settings if your intention is to only use black ink. There are three or four different places in the print driver to indicate you want to print in black only. If you overlook one or two of these settings, you might accidentally use up your color ink even though your document is a black and white document.  We were making this mistake for a few days and we soon found the color ink depleted. The printer won't print if one of the ink cartridges is depleted, even if you don't really need that color for your job. So that was a $200 mistake for us. I subsequently had a conversation with an HP representative who claimed that a little bit of color ink is always used when printing in order to create ""true-black"" -- even if you are not printing a color document. I am not sure if this is really true. If so, the settings in the print driver suggesting you are printing with black ink only are misleading. In any case, you will want to check your ink levels periodically so that you don't run out of a given color of ink unexpectedly.

It is easier to be sure you are using black ink only (or mostly?) if you print from the on-board touch-screen. However, the touch-screen menu is not as detailed as the print driver in your computer, so you can't adjust the ink saturation, for instance. I found that I could save ink by reducing the ink saturation using the ink settings in the print driver. There are three sliders in the driver to control saturation, ink drying time, etc. Slide these all the way to the left if you are hell-bent on saving ink, and money. Your prints will look a little bit gray, but still perfectly legible. But I don't have the same control when printing from the touch-screen using a thumb drive. Another short-coming of the touch-screen menu is that it is not possible to print selected pages. You have to print the whole document - or at least the first few pages - then cancel the job. Another downside of using the touch-screen to print is that it can be difficult to print two-sided documents. You don't have the same control over how print images are flipped, so that the print on the back side of your paper might be upside down.  This may be more likely when printing in the landscape mode.

If you are trying to save ink by playing with the settings, be careful you don't go too far. You might end up with faint images, or characters that are not fully formed on the page. Look closely at your fine print. The one setting that I found I should avoid enabling was called ""HP easy color"" This setting seemed to degrade my print-outs, and also prevented me from using the ink saturation controls.

A few other quibbles about this machine:  I have been using it with Windows XP. I have used it with two different computers. On both computers, I found that though it is possible to save the print settings, they don't always stay saved. On one of my machines, the saved settings would simply disappear entirely, then maybe re-appear a moment later as I was trying to reset the settings manually. I find that it is always a good idea to double check your important settings one at a time to make sure that they have not reverted to the defaults.

Another quibble: I had a lot of trouble getting the printer to print on 7-in. x 9 in. custom-sized paper. I finally was able to do it, but only by putting the paper in the optional tray #3. Why it worked in this tray and not the others is beyond me. (A little further testing suggested that printing on custom-size paper may only be possible in the ""Professional"" print mode, and that possibly using the ""Professional"" mode may allow for printing from any print tray using custom-size paper.)

I have not done as much color printing with this printer. But what I have noticed is that it is not as crisp and vibrant with color printing as some other types of printers. For instance, the Xerox 8870 uses a waxy type ink that floats on the paper and looks bright and glossy. The X551 by contrast uses ink that is absorbed into the paper leaving colors looking flat and dull by comparison. Oversaturating your paper probably makes matters worse by causing colors to mix at the edges. HP offers a special color-lock (?) paper that is supposed to help with this problem, and I suspect it does help, at least a little. But for my color printing, I prefer my Xerox 8870.

I have had several  conversations with HP technical support about different problems I was having. They have seemed very helpful. It seems that they have a special team that assists customers of their business-class printers. It may also be that since this is a new printer, they are trying hard to make customers happy and work out any bugs in the system.

Update after 10 months of heavy use: Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! This is one amazing printer! I have printed probably close to 150,000 print-outs, mostly double-sided, so maybe 75,000 sheets of paper. I can count the paper jams on one hand. There have been no machine break-downs yet! I want to cuss with joy at the reliability of this printer! My only real gripe is that you still have to pay for ink, and it seems to sip the color ink even when printing in black and white. I tried to use an ink-refill kit to lower my ink costs, but that effort failed because the printer did not recognize the cartridge had been refilled. The cartridges apparently have an electronic chip in them that makes a viable refill system harder to produce. So for now it seems users must rely on genuine HP cartridges. But if you don't mind paying for ink, this is one awesome machine!!!

UPDATE: After more than a year of use, and 178,000 print-outs (almost 90,000 sheets of paper), the machine developed a habit of paper jams. These were not real jams -- there was usually no paper crinkled up in the machine. In fact, the paper path was often entirely clear of any paper at all. But something had fooled the machine into thinking that a jam had occurred. I could usually print a few pages without a problem, or maybe even a hundred pages, but then the paper jams would start and quickly become more frequent. My call to tech-support could not resolve the problem. The phone support guy said that a repair person would come out and fix the machine. But what actually happened is that an HP representative delivered a new machine within two or three business days -- for free! Granted, a few months earlier I had taken a gamble and had purchased a 3-year replacement warranty for $120 (HP Care Pack). This turned out to be a good investment.

I am very impressed with HP's machine, and with their customer support. Very highly impressed!

Update Oct. 2015: I have had this printer for more than two years now. I still think it is an amazing printer, but I have a little more info to add. My first printer developed problems and was replaced at no charge after more than a year of use (details above). My second printer developed a problem with ink speckling the pages after 152,000 print-outs. Thanks to my wise purchase of a three-year extended warranty, this second printer was replaced immediately with another printer. HP sent me the new printer overnight! They also sent me instructions and a mailing label for sending back the old printer. Unfortunately, the replacement printer had a print problem -- a faint smear of ink appeared below some images. A tech-support person who I spoke to on the phone had me e-mail images of the problem, then speculated that the print head might be misaligned. So HP immediately sent me another printer! I got two new printers in the space of a week! The second printer worked fine.

I definitely think HP is working hard to keep me happy. The policy of sending replacement printers is undoubtedly costly, but in my experience, it works much better than sending out repair guys who may not know what they are doing. (I had this experience with a Xerox printer.) Even if you occasionally get a defective replacement machine, the process of sending printers back and forth is much better than sending out one repair guy after another to fumble about, often making matters worse, and sometimes taking weeks to finally get the machine working, if they ever do.

I said earlier that inkjet printers do not curl the paper the way that laser printers do. This is true. But even inkjets can cause some curling depending on how much ink is required, and the type and size of the paper. Documents that have large images are more prone to curling. We found that when we printed on some odd-shaped paper (6x14""), the paper curled so much that it sometimes caused problems as the paper collects after the printer spits it out. Sheets would bump into each other and we would soon have a pile of curled up papers that had to be sorted out. We had to watch the printing closely and remove print-outs from the printer to prevent a traffic jam in the output area. Factors like temperature, humidity and air movement might influence how much curl you get, and how long the curl lasts. As the paper dries, the curl subsides.

One final comment: If you choose the fastest print option (General Office), you may notice if you look closely that you get some very faint ink smears near dark images on the page. Whether you do or not may depend on what kind of paper you use, how much ink you use, the humidity, and other factors. In any case, the solution seems to be to slow down the printing. Try using the ""Professional"" printing option. If the ink smears persist, or seem serious, there are a couple procedures available for removing ink smears and cleaning the print-head. Check the tools menu or the instruction manual for details.",41,10.575633

That is what happened when IU just put plain paper pictures up with tape and ruined them when I had to remove them from my old home refrigerator.  I won't have that problem again!  Oh, HAPPY DAYS.

If I can do this lamination as easily as I did, anyone can use it.  No cords to bother with; no heat to burn fingers.  I love it.  After my friends see this I am going to tell them to rush to AMAZON and get the Xyron Ezlaminator (624672)  and they can have pretty pictures of their loved ones wherever they want.  I need to tell you also that I am taking a class in Colored Pencil ART and I feel sure the finished product (if and when that happens) will smudge quite easily.  We're doing them on 8x10 cardstock and hopefully they will be preserved.  I think that will be a primary use from then on.",2,7.661356

4479,"Con-tact Brand Self Adhesive Chalkboard Liner is a great concept! And it does work - you can write on it in chalk and erase. I loved the idea of just sticking chalkboard on the wall, and wanted to get some of the Con-tact brand to compare with chalkboard paint, as well as some other products we have.

The pros of the Con-tact Brand Self-Adhesive Chalkboard Liner, are that it's self-adhesive (!), and that you don't have to deal with painting.
The cons are that this isn't really meant to go on walls I guess. I know it's Con-tact ""Liner"", but I don't know anyone who wants to put chalkboard in a drawer!  The material is uber thin! and rips very easily!  So please be very careful when applying the liner!

I DID use it on one of our son's walls - he's very creative, and posts all of his new drawings - so I thought it would be fun for him to have chalkboard right next to his bed.

I would recommend if you try this cut a piece off and see how it goes on before attempting a large piece! It's really important to ""place it"" on the wall from the center of your piece, and then use a straight edge to smooth from the center ... outward - just like wallpapering. If not you're likely to get bubbles or ripping. I was lucky to find this out with the first piece I tried! (I'm not a direction reader!) So after the first piece it went on pretty much without a hitch. And it can be pulled up and adjusted somewhat ... not a lot, but if you haven't gotten too far into your piece, you'll probably be okay to pull up and adjust - like you might with wallpaper.",3,7.8756824
4480,"My kids and I are huge Learning Resource fans so we were super excited to try out this new for 2014 game: Vowel Owls.
Owls are so popular right now! I see them everywhere, especially for home decor. It makes sense that a game would feature these adorable creatures as well! This game has the five vowels, one on each Owl, and one Owl that is blank.

It comes with a bunch of cards that have an Owl on one side and a picture on the other.

As with all Learning Resources games, there are several variations and options presented in the directions. My four and a half year old Paige wanted to play this first and she just liked to look at the cards and pick the Owl it went in. Since she is just in Pre-K , she doesnt know the difference yet between short and long vowel sounds on all of the letters. She is actually in the middle of learning this. So she just did the best she could with what she knew and I gave her a small variety of cards I thought shed know to start.

My son is six and in Kindergarten and he was really excited about this game! Kindergarteners love learning and are at that fun age where its exciting to them and every challenge is looked upon with great anticipation. He wanted to do ALL the cards himself and did a great job at putting them in the appropriate Owls.

There are six ideas of ways to play under Suggested Activities in the directions. I love that there are so many options so you can mix it up if they don't respond to one or you have more people etc. Its always nice to have variety and kids tire much less quickly of the same game because its ever changing.

This is rated for kids 5+ in Kinder+ and I think thats dead on. It was just a little too old for my four and a half year old but perfect for my six year old in Kinder. Vowel Owls has been on my table being played every day for two weeks so its definitely a hit AND they are learning and affirming what they learn in school!",10,10.88477
4481,"""China markers"", ""crayon pencils"", ""grease pencils"", or ""wax pencils"" were the general-purpose markers 50 years ago before felt-tip markers (FTPs in the following discussion) were invented.

DISADVANTAGES OF FELT-TIPPED MARKERS
Water soluble FTPs will not mark non-porous surfaces (such as glass, china, hard plastic, etc.)---or wipe off too easily.  The slightest dampness will cause soluble FTPs to run.  On the otherhand, permanent FTPs are pretty permanent and hard to remove.  The ink in FTPs (whether water soluble or permanent) fades after a few weeks in sunlight.

ADVANTAGES OF CHINA MARKERS
China markers will mark anything, with a little elbow-grease can be completely wiped off any non-porous surface.  China markers resist fading in sunlight.

USES
China markers are ideal for marking china (dishes and bowls), e.g., prices at a garage sale.  They can be used for decorating picture windows, or prices on used cars for sale.  They are particularly good with garden tags to record what you've planted.  They are good for labeling paper packages and plastic or glass containers of food for storage in a refrigerator.  They can be used as simple crayons for art projects.  Speaking of which, the marks are just as difficult as crayons to remove from fabrics.

FIXING SCRATCHED CDs/DVDs
However, I purchased them for fixing scratched CDs.  I had purchased a kit (a wax pencil and a cloth) years ago for the purpose, but can no longer find the kit for sale.  If your disk has a single scratch which is causing a problem---mark over the scratch with black china marker, and then wipe the excess off with a clean cloth, rubbing across (not along) the scratch.  And miraculously, the CD will play, most of the time.  Apparently the black pigment in the scratch prevents extraneous reflections which cause the problems.  This doesn't always work, but at least you've done no damage to the CD, and you can always try a more vigorous method.

If your CD/DVD has many scratches, you may want to cover the entire surface with the black marker marks, then wipe off.  If that doesn't work, another method is to scrub with toothpaste.  Scrubbing with toothpaste will dull the surface with hundreds of shallow scratches, but may remove the slightly deeper scratches which are causing the problem.  A special kit may be a better solution if the black  wax pencil doesn't work.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Maxell-CD-CD-ROM-Scratch-Repair-Kit/dp/B00000J1E6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Maxell CD/CD-ROM Scratch Repair Kit</a>

4489,"I've used everything from Kodak (remember them?) to HP and Canon. Canon papers hold their colors MUCH longer, and the colors don't bleed or form edges between colors. I can't give it higher praise than that. I have photos that I printed on Canon glossy paper three years ago that do get some sunlight, and they have not faded. I have two images printed on HP paper with HP ink, and they've lost their color and definition.

Note that for years when I was using an SLR and Kodakchrome film, I insisted on Kodak processing. The prints held their color an definition for 10 years give or take. So I am not praising Canon just yet, and I'm not knocking other papers unless they've already shown deficiencies.

So, why four stars? 1. I rarely use 4x6, sticking pretty much to the 5x7. 2. It's expensive stuff - second only to the Canon ink -  when you get better at photography and start printing out your best stuff (last year, I ran through 8 boxes of 5x7, and I was being careful). And 3. to get the best out of the paper, you really have to use Canon ink and the corresponding Canon printer. Printers are cheap; ink isn't. I figure that a 4x6 print costs me about 45, and a 5x7 as much as 90. I seem to be one of a very few who has figured out the true cost of paper and ink in the digital age. (There's also the additional cost after a year when you get a better shot, and have to print something new. I have only 10 photos hanging in my office, but I have over 175 in the drawer, all ""favorites"" when I printed them.) Oh, well, so long as ink and paper remain cheaper than a gallon of gas...",2,13.377954
4490,"I got a Handspring because it was cool.  It has the card-slot (springboard), which is a little limited in what has actually come out for it, but it's a good design.
The deluxe model has 8MB, and this was a good price for an 8mb palm-pilot with an upgrade slot, plus, cool colors.
With the non-deluxe model, this is dropped to 2MB.  It's only purpose in life was to be a cheaper replacement for the Palm III and earlier.
Then I realized the problem.  The O/S is in ROM, not FLASH.  The O/S on these are Palm v3.1, which is about a year old.  THERE IS NO UPGRADE PATH TO PALM O/S 3.5!  To upgrade, you have to buy a whole new one.
Even if you could, you'd have to wait for handspring's version.
I recommend the Palm-IIIxe, it's the same thing, minus the springboard module (only REALLY useful for a few things, which are easily worked around).  Palm 3xe has 8mb, and FLASH ROM, plus it comes with Palm O/S 3.5 and is upgradable.  If you NEED the cellphone or wireless option, there are sleeves that fit over the pilot that do this.",6,8.777132
4491,"After losing my trusted little HP Inkjet 3910 to old age and hard use, I went shopping for a new printer that would be economical on ink and do what I want it to do. The first printer I bought locally I was very unhappy with. I decided to see what Amazon had to offer so looked at several models and read lots of reviews. I decided to order this Canon Pixma printer. I have never owned a Canon product before so this was new territory for me.

The printer arrived in less than a week, like 2 business days into the week after ordering it on a Saturday and with a national holiday on Monday--so surprised by the speedy delivery! When I finally had time to set it up--just a week after ordering it--set up was quick and simple. It took less than an hour, much less, to get it up and running, the printer program installed on our computer, and wireless humming along. Very pleased!

Since then, I have to say that I am convinced that I made the right decision in ordering this printer. It works like a charm. Prints quietly and fast enough for my needs. I love having the two separate paper trays and that the rear paper tray stays folded up and closed when not needed. It's not too difficult to figure out how to use the on-printer controls if you are using it as a copier. I'm really liking that little pop-up screen on the top of the printer! Everything I've asked it to print so far has come out great. It had no problem feeding or printing my 90# cardstock sheets (I used one of the photo paper settings for that).

I haven't printed a whole bunch of scrapbook papers yet--I love to print out digital scrapbook papers to use in my card making--so I can't say what kind of mileage the ink cartridges will give me, but I've already priced replacements on Amazon and they're cheap enough that I can afford to print out my own scrapbook papers.

4499,"This past year I discovered the fun of using adhesive chalkboards and labels around the house. We have a preference for liquid chalks over traditional chalk. Liquid chalks look brighter and more vibrant and they are easier to clean. And of course there's no chalk dust! We use both colored liquid chalks and white ones depending on where we're using them. Recently I was given the opportunity to purchase the Crafty Crock White Liquid markers at a discount so I could try them out & share my thoughts on them. They work just as well as other liquid chalk markers that I have tried. It takes a few moments of priming the marker to get the ink to flow. Because most of my adhesive chalkboards on walls or other upright containers, I do have to reprime it after every few words I write. One thing that makes this brand better than the others is that it comes with a reversible tip! It's really easy to switch the tips, so I recommend that you change the tips before you prime the ink! The chalk ink cleans easily with water and leaves no ghosting behind. I've included a picture of the chalkboard adhesive that I have on my kitchen refrigerator.

4506,"In the entry-level category of wide-format color inkjet printers there are essentially three brand-names that are available to the consumer ... HP, Epson and Canon.  As a professional in the graphics arts industry I have owned all of the above as small-format home printers yet none of the above as pro or semi-pro wide format models.  There is a reason.  People who take photographs professionally (and probably at one time spent many hours printing photos in a darkroom) tend to shy away from these types of ink jet printers and outsource our printing work to specialty labs who own and maintain equipment far beyond our budgets.  Although I have done darkroom duty, the vast majority of my chemical processing and now digital processing is done by one or two highly trusted print houses.

While my experience in photography gives me some special insights into what a good print (color or B&W) should look like, I'll cut to the chase and tell you right now you won't find it in a sub-$300 inkjet printer.

Don't take that as a negative ... today's inkjet printers from all of the major manufacturers can deliver incredible enlargements.  It's just that when you make your living at it, the standards just get out of the reach of a low-cost printer.

So, first off, I won't try to compare this printer with a lab quality machine, nor will I try to tapdance a litany of impressive sounding specs, but rather give you, based on my experience, some insight that hopefully will help you decide if this printer will meet your home-printing needs.

Starting with brand-name ... one thing in life I have an inordinate amount of experience with is color inkjet printers.  Right at this moment I own 6 that are active and have at one time or another owned close to 30.  I have consulted with the manufacturers, did technical training on the products, and had hands-on experience with more brands (there used to be a lot more) and models of printers than most people can imagine.  I have personal preferences but I can state flat out that among the current ""Big 3"" listed above, there is no ""best"" brand.  Sometimes the differences between models between one brand name and another would have you think that certain models aren't even made by the same brand, in other words I have used some great and some terrible individual models from all of the companies.  I have zero vested interest in any of the major brand names so, trust me, this review will not lean pro or con for Canon or anyone else.

FIRST TOPIC - EASE OF SETUP: when other reviews you may have read warn you that this is a BIG printer, don't just gloss over that ... this is a BIG printer. When it was delivered the burly UPS driver was sweating as he brought it to the door. I am so happy I was expecting it because it arrived in the OEM box and if I had not been at home you would likely be reading a review on it right now from one of my neighbors. Setting it up isn't magic for someone who has set up an inkjet printer before.  Open box, install printhead and ink cartridges, run software, run a test print to auto-set alignment. Being a printer designed for more of a purist you will also want to run through some tweaking of the color controls using 4 x 6 paper before you insert that first sheet of pricy 13 x 19 paper. Canon's setup ""manual"" is a simplistic fold out road map but they supply an electronic user manual that is highly detailed and useful.

QUALITY OF CONSTRUCTION: I won't compare it to other brands or models for the reason I described above ... there is no definite consistency of virtually anything between different models from the largest home printer manufacturers.  Rated on its own merit, the quality of the plastics used is a little heavier duty than average, the onboard controls are definitive (the two main buttons are almost comical, huge stainless steel-looking buttons that dominate the right-front side of the printer), the paper trays are a little above average, noise level is average, paper handling is smooth and less jerky than some others I have used and the overall feel is of a product that will probably serve well for at least a few years.

SPEED:  Inkjet manufactures like to spout off ridiculous speed specs that are meaningless in everyday life.  When it comes to a printer that has a purpose of primarily printing photo quality prints, speed is not a virtue, in fact a slower speed can assure more accuracy in the placement of the ink droplets.  This printer to Canon's credit does not claim unrealistic speeds.  On an average 8 x 10 print I would say the speed differs very little from the Epson, HP and Canon printers on my desktop.

INK ECONOMY:  Canon is the only company I have seen who publishes a realistic guide to real-life ink usage (available at the PRO-100 support site online).  It is frustrating to see printer manufacturers advertise their products on the basis of the price of the ink cartridge without factoring in the actual usable amount of ink contained in the cartridge or better yet, the actual real-life yield of a cartridge.  Canon's chart attempts to give you a track to run on for each of the 8 cartridges when used in a real-life situation. Kudos Canon!  Over time I will compare Canon's estimates to my actual usage and update this review as necessary.  It is good (in a way) to know that not all of the inks are expected to drain equally in real life, but real life also requires that I tell you that if you replaced all 8 cartridges at once you will be writing out a check for at least $125.  No small investment.

HOW DO THE PRINTS LOOK:  the question is so subjective with so many variables I simply can't answer with anything that won't sound like an ad for Canon or one of its competitors.  I would be suspicious of any review that attempted to do that.  I will give you the results of one carefully controlled printing episode as an example.  The digital image was taken under challenging conditions of a white egret against a dark swampy pond which resulted in a high contrast ratio that I managed in-camera.  The image size was sufficient to warrant a 13 x 19 print.  I selected Canon's own brand of paper because it would not be fair to judge a printer with paper and ink that it was not optimized for. I went for one of Canon's best papers (Pro Platinum) to make the test effective.  I supplied that same image to a highly regarded and trusted lab for them to also make an analyzed digital print on a super-expensive non-Canon paper.  I hung them both in a gallery side-by-side and only stated that the photos represented ""different conditions"".  The results didn't skew noticeably toward either print, but I had more favorable comments about the lab print like ""I feel I could stroke those feathers they are so real"" but the Canon print also got favorable remarks like ""the egret is so 3D I feel I could walk around it"". Net result? ""Better"" is in the eye of the beholder.

THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW: The supplied setup CD includes a baffling amount of apps, more than I have ever seen for a printer. You are warned that it could take a long time to load the drivers and apps and they aren't kidding ... it took almost 30 minutes plus another 30 minutes to run the mandatory alignment process and do some basic color matching setup. You should also know that, while all of those apps may be useful, in no place does Canon give you a simple guide to what they are all meant to be used for.  You may not actually need to know that to print a nice picture but if you can print a ""better"" picture using the apps it would be nice if Canon would take you by the hand and walk you through the process. I will give a shoutout to Canon, though, that the install process went seamlessly, which seems to be a bit rare with some of the rushed-to-market software being delivered today. I did not have to disable my virus app or have any user intervention for the most part.

Although the wood is soft, it looked jagged and rough in many places. Instead of returning the product, I decided to open it up and sand down the rough parts (there were many). It kind of ruins the gift a little, since I had to open the package, but I didn't want the person to get splinters from my gift!  The ""worst"" places on the pencil are the parts imprinted with the pencil's name and the SUCK UK name--those words are sort of faded and there was a black mark that may have been an ink stain that I also sanded off.

I still like the idea of the product, and I am going to include a pencil sharpener (with a larger than standard hole) with the gift as suggested by another reviewer.",3,7.3180685

4515,"The ink itself is underwhelming. The color inks are quite lacking, and the black ink looks fine when pages of notes are filled with it. however, when my pen runs out and I switch to another pen, usually my Rotring Artpen with black ink, the comparisons are a sudden shock of ""Oh yeah, so THAT is what black is"". Comparing the ink to a high end ink, a saturated ink, or even worse, a dip pen ink for how black the black inks are is just unfair to the Lamy ink. Pretty much any other fountain pen ink will blow the colors of the Lamy ink out of the water.
That being said, you're wondering why I gave this three stars. The ink does come in a bottle, after all. The blotting paper is a nice little touch for someone who does not yet have a dedicated ink wiping cloth, although it isn't directly refillable. The bottle itself, however, with the reservoir at the bottom and the wide stable base is possibly the single greatest design for an ink bottle ever. when the ink gets low, there is no tilting or anything to try to get out the last bits, you just keep going with the pen in the middle pen dip until it can no longer suck out the ink, then decant or use an eyedropper. The bottle is so good that it balances out the bad of the ink itself. Lamy ink is worth getting just for the bottle alone if you use fountain pens and ink bottles regularly, it really is that good. Second place bottle is probably the Akkerman style bottle with the glass sealing ball, for those interested in the alternative to the Lamy, especially for those who intend to use the ink.",10,9.08545

I had a Canon MX870 which I loved but after seven years it finally broke down and couldn't be fixed. The MX922 looked similar so I bought it, but while it does a okay job with normal copying, here's what I don't like:

1. It takes forever to actually print. I waited five minutes one time for one copy, so don't ever be in a hurry to make copies. It also makes a lot of noise while its going through its setup phase. I could live with that, if it would print faster.
2. I hate the scanning utility. The MX870 had a great scanning utility that made it very versatile to use. This one does not. When I scan something, I can't enlarge the scanned photo without saving it to see how well the scan looks. I can't scan pages and then reorder them before saving.
3. Photos look terrible when you copy them. The ink comes out blotchy in places and line show up across the page. I need to copy a lot of photos for my business, so this is a deal breaker for me. I've tried copying in color or black and white and tried various paper types and it does matter. It creates lines going across the page. These lines aren't visible when scanning but are very visible when printing.
4. The other issue with printing photos is the printing has a hard time grabbing the photo paper. It frequently grabs two and prints part of the picture on one and part on the other.

For this reason alone, I would not recommend this printer.",3,7.94531

4518,"The phone was delivered promptly and complete as advertised.  It was easy to connect and after an easy to follow setup (configuration)it went into service without a problem.  I use it with a ""hands free"" headset and the built in amplifier allows me to easily switch to a higher volume level in addition to being able to adjust the volume through ""steps"" using the arrow keys.  The ""amplify"" button is separate and a ""toggle"".  That is, pushing it once greatly increases volume, and pushing it a second time returns to normal volume.  Then in each mode, the volume may be stepped up and down with the arrow keys.  It has a 50 position phone number memory, which is helpful since I have more than ten contacts and entering contacts is easy.  It has a clip to hang on my belt or pants pocket, but past experience has shown me that my hands free headset cord gets hung up on things when I walk around, so I use a lanyard like teachers wear for their whistle and ID badge and hang the phone around my neck as I walk around while using my hands free headset.  In doing so the headset cord never gets hung up and jerked out of its socket.  The answering machine section is easy to set up and can be configured to beep once in a while if a new message has been received.  This is handy if one has been out of the house and doesn't think to check messages as soon as they get home.  This feature can also be silenced.  And finally, additional hand sets can be added, although I've not yet utilized this feature.  I walk outside the house and most generally, the audio remains clear.

The Pilot Varsity pen lays down a great fine-to-medium line of ink, and the nib (IE: the writing tip) does not dry out too fast when left uncapped -- and the pen seems to write forever with its large internal ink reservoir.

4526,"At first sight, I thought this was the most beautifully solid mechanical pencil for me. It reminds me of the transparent plastic Uni Kuru Toga Engine that you can find at the local WalMart, but quite a bit more refined. It has a very good grip at the base which prevents slippage and, should you need one, it also includes a tiny white eraser with a cap to hide it. I do appreciate the grip (the base where you hold it) with all its grooves because I simply detest thin and slippery pencils that don't conform to the hand.

However, similarly to its more inexpensive plastic cousin, the Uni Kuru Toga Roulette (the one I'm reviewing) has a tip that moves every time you press it against the paper. Personally, which is all I can offer herein, I find it very distracting and disconcerting when writing.  I thought that it might be a defect on the product I received, but when I reviewed the plastic Uni Kuru Toga Engine, it did the same thing every time I pressed it onto paper. That movement should be more subtle, but because it is not, I have to deduct a star in my review. I need a solid instrument whose parts are not going to move, or distract me, when I write with it.

PROS:
It is metal and feels as solid as a mechanical pencil can feel, yet it is light.
It is slightly thicker around the base (where you hold it) and it that gives it the perfect girth for a good grip without tiring the hand.
Aesthetically, it is very pleasing as it is made of metal, and that is also part of why you pay for a pencil like this.

CONS:
When you press on it against paper, in essence, when you are getting ready to write, the tip sinks in ever so slightly that it distracts me enough to deduct a star.
Also, while the pencil looks very clean in its design, the eraser cap is made of greyish plastic which does not fit in with the brushed stainless/aluminum look of the pencil.

While I do like this product, I will keep looking for a more solid mechanical pencil. I hope this helps.",2,10.868494
4527,"I have a lot of comics.  No really, a lot of comics.  As in, I used to be a comic shop owner, and need an extra room in my house just for my comics.

As a good comic book owner, I get excessive pleasure out of putting them in little plastic bags and backing boards.  I love seeing all my comics nicely cared for and filed away in comic boxes.  In fact, I love this so much I have been on a mission to re-bag my collection, some of which have been yellowing away in their old plastic bags for multiple decades.

Re-bagging an entire collection is an expensive proposition, one made much easier and much affordable by finding this ""200 Current Size Comic Book Bags and Boards Combo.""

And it does a good job of printing photos. This printer uses a single color cartridge so that you have to change out the color cartridge any time one color is consumed.

Scan is half the speed of dedicated scanners, duplex is mechanical flip, not dual sensor like gts50.  Prints quickly and in color, wireless capability for multiple devices.

But at the sale price and trade in credit at a local depot retailer.. It is a five star value. Update. Still amazing. Using Yo Ink with no problems!

UPDATE:  clogged nozzle issues are driving me crazy.  I replaced all the cartridges but the black and magenta are consistently clogged despite multiple printhead cleanings.  HELP!!!

2nd UPDATE:  My rating has gone up to 4 stars.. let me tell you why.  I am on my third Epson WF-4630... and I have realized that the printheads are not clogging any further.  On this particular unit, one of the printheads has missing spots on the nozzle test printout.  With that said, I believe I am beginning to understand what has happened.

I was so bummed... with Epson brand ink,  just the color cartridges alone will run you about $68.00, $100+ with the black XL.

4531,"This is the finest fountain pen you can find at this price. Fit and finish of the pen is excellent and it both looks and feels like a precision writing instrument. The nib is smooth and moves across the paper with ease using Pilot ink. The cap posts well on the pen. It's never worked loose during normal writing for me. Posting shifts the pen balance due to the weight of the cap. Unless you have large hands you can write with the cap unposted with ease.

The body, section, feed and nib of the Metropolitan disassemble for cleaning. Some pens have a fixed section and feed that require a bulb syringe to flush ink.

I've added other pens to my collection but I always compare them to the Pilot Metropolitan for writing quality and fit and finish. This pen is a worthy addition to your writing collection and makes an excellent first fountain pen.

This pen has some drawbacks.
- It's heavier than plastic pens. The body and cap of the Metropolitan are made of brass. Posting the cap shifts the balance of the pen toward the rear. The fix is to write with the cap unposted.
- It has a snap cap. That may not be a drawback to you but I prefer the screw type caps. The act of unscrewing a fountain pen cap is part of the pleasure of using these pens.
- Two writing nib sizes: Japanese fine and medium (equivalent to European extra fine and fine). The nib is well-behaved using Pilot ink but can feel scratchy with other inks. Pilot ink lubricates the finer point of their nibs better than any other ink.

Thats just how it works, cheaper printer = more expensive ink, expensive printer = usually cheaper ink.

I have tried refilling the OEM cartridges and just got frustrating error messages and could not get them to work.

Now, I do not print picture perfect photos or even really care if the color isn't there. Color just mean I am going to spend more money over time. I have always been happy with just gray-scale or B&W but for this price, I will can print color more often. I will use these for my work presentations or school assignments.

Now if you go to the big box retail stores and price just one cartridge, you will see the HP brand is as much as this whole set of six.  So far this cartridge has worked great and look forward to replacing the others when they go dry. Some aftermarket ink cartridges will smear, leak, clog, or dry up too quick.

I can get a good amount of line variation for a nib that is not intended to be a full flex nib. However, for those who like to write finely or small, this is a good nib. You can achieve this kind of writing if you do not try to push down on it (and you shouldn't have to).
The resin feels solid, and it looks elegant and lustrous with the rhodium trim. It feels well-balanced, especially when posted.

This is the best price I have seen for this pen, and there seem to be few places that sell it in the United States; I'm surprised it's not more popular! The delivery estimate given was about a month and a half from the date I ordered it, and no tracking information was available after it shipped. But, the pen arrived in less than 10 days with a signed note from the vendor's president!

So far, I can't think of anything I dislike about it.",3,7.3883257

4542,"If you're looking for a pretty lightweight, compact laminator for occasional use, this is a good choice. If you are going to be laminating on a regular basis, pick another (higher end) product.

I received this laminator for free via the Vine program, and it is the first one I've owned. I have used industrial ones for other projects, so that's my only frame of reference. I was a little hesitant to order it because I had some concern that the laminating pouches would be expensive, making it an object like a printer, whose price is relatively cheap but ink cartridges cost a lot. This laminator uses any pouch that are less than 9"" wide, and from 3-10 mm, and those are relatively inexpensive.

It loses a star for the length of time it takes to heat up (7 minutes for me!) and for accepting 10mm but only having a 5 mm heat setting. It definitely laminates slower than a higher end machine (no surprise), but overall, the process was painless and pretty straightforward.

I had to keep hitting the continue button ever time! This is by design, folks (same experience with a former HP printer).

But, I did make one adjustment.  After the tabs were placed on the fridge and I waited.  I fit the other set of tabs on top of it and pulled off the clear strips so they would adhere to the pocket.  Then I pressed the pocket onto them.  It would have been difficult to line them up exactly if I hadn't done this, or I would have had to use a ruler and take measurements.  It worked well the way I did it.  The only reason I don't love it is that I wish it was a little more flexible because I will want to take papers in and out of it.

4547,"I love my Epson Perfection v30 scanner.  It replaced a trusty Epson Perfection 2400 Photo that I have had for about 3 years.  The quality of scanned images is better with this new scanner, thanks to the higher DPI rating.  And, thanks to the new LED scan technology, there is no longer any warm-up time at all and, on top of that, once the scanning starts, It scans faster than my Perfection 2400 Photo.  Finally, it is quieter.  It is a winner on all three of these counts compared to my old scanner, no doubt.

Plus, at just under 1 "" high it is less than half as tall as the Perfection 2400 Photo.  This, coupled with the fact that the top opens across the width of the scanner as opposed to along the length, means that this scanner works much, MUCH better for me on the wall-mounted shelf in my home office where I like to put a scanner.  This alone has me sold on this scanner as a replacement for my old one, which was always a little hard to get to and kind of ""clunky"" to use on the shelf.

Finally, this scanner works great with both Mac OS X (v10.5.6) & Windows Vista 64-bit (SP1).  I have both a Mac & a PC in my office, and I use a USB switch to switch the scanner back and forth between the two systems.  The supplied driver works well on both operating systems - the interface is even the same.  And, as a bonus, the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software with the strange name (ABBYY FineReader Sprint) that comes included with the scanner works great (Windows only, however - there is no Mac version of this OCR software).

Finally, at the incredibly affordable price being charged for this scanner, I think it is an awesome deal.  For anyone with less-than-professional scanning needs who wants a fast, quiet & capable scanner for either Mac OS X or Windows, I cannot recommend this scanner highly enough.  I'd give it 6 stars if I could!",94,9.772516

Still pretty and kind of cute, wasn't sure I liked that, but they aren't so bad. So, since others may not realize this,**** I've included images of the actual tabs on the sheets.

Few notes to others: It includes only Song of Solomon, not Song of Songs.
To remove these from the sheet, I recommend separating along the perforation on the 1/3 mark, makes for an easier handling while doing this.
Also, for easier removal, the tabs kind of stick together and on the sheet, fold along the length, the straight line, which helps some.
In addition, I found it easier to remove when the sheet was rolled back at the edge, remove the triangle piece and found it easier to get off that way.

I did stick one to two pages, and removed fairly easily, but if not done very gently would rip. These are pretty sticky.

The tabs are fully sticky. So, when folded over the edge, the full tab sticks back onto itself. That means that some might not line up perfectly. My last set were only a little flap on the end that stuck, the tab was free. These are the whole tab that sticks.

4559,"This machine is packed with all the key features that are required when printing today: Laser printing, WIFI printing, and Airprint printing... all at an entry level price point.

I just got this printer today and so far so good. I had it set up for wireless in about 10-minutes, but then I must have hit the wrong button and I lost my WIFI connection. I got it all set up again, but this time it took about an hour. I had to re-install the Windows 7 drivers and reestablish my wireless connection.

Once I could see the Brother printer on my wireless network, setting up my Macbook Pro and my other Windows 7 machine was a breeze. For the Mac, however, the CD provided a link to their website to download the driver for OS 10.9, other than that installation went just fine.

This thing goes right to sleep after a few minutes. I initially thought that would be a problem, yet I also discovered that it tends to wake up fast and do its job! I also printed successfully from my iPad using Airprint with absolutely no problems. For the price and all its features, especially the toner savings, the value this Brother printer represents just can't be beat.

4561,"I bought one of these beauties for use with a Nexbox Android TV box, so that I could occasionally enjoy the option of an air mouse and/or keyboard when I need to.  And for those purposes, this device is an absolute winner.  In fact, I have yet to even pick up the remote that came with the box, as this one has it beat in every possible way.  Not too bad for a $15 remote.  I can't speak to its usability with PCs and other devices, but I honestly can't think of a good reason to think anything would be all that different.  It just works, without undue fuss or complication - or much cost.  What's not to love?

Pros:
+ Plug and play.  No bluetooth pairing.  Just plug in the dongle, pop a battery in the remote, and fire up your device!
+ The air mouse works like a charm.  Sure beats trying to use a regular remote's mouse button.
+ Air mouse function can easily be toggled on/off via a single button.  There are times when the mouse can just get in the way, so nice to be able to shut it off.
+ The keyboard is much faster to work with than trying to navigate on screen buttons.
+ The buttons themselves seem solid and have a similar action to most remotes, so I'd expect decent durability.
+ This unit seems to have all the buttons you'd commonly wish for in a TV box remote, and not much more - keeping it simple.

Cons:
- Battery not included.  No biggy, and barely worth mentioning.
- Letters/numbers for ALT keys are in dark blue (on black), making them hard to read.  That's just dumb.
- Because this is not a bluetooth remote, it requires its own dongle, which takes up a precious USB port.  But being the cost of making this device both stupid easy and flexible (no line of sight needed), I can live with that.

If this device were more expensive, I might be inclined to give it four stars.  But being at such a low price point and boasting the features that it does, I can't see any reason to knock it.  I'm very happy with mine, because I knew exactly what I was after when I bought it.  If you do the same, I think you'll be happy with it too.",2,8.45969
4562,"I purchased this shredder back in 2009 to shred up the junk mail credit card applications that I receive in the mail. I have used it to tear up credit card applications, bank statements, old documents, credit cards, paper clips, and staples. I even tried to shred a DVD in it once but I don't think its strong enough to shred dvd's without getting messed up. I have tossed envelopes with the letter still inside of the envelope and this shredder hasn't had any problems with the thin envelopes but it has gotten jammed when trying to shred thick envelopes that contain customer terms of agreements in them. The basket that it has is small, fills up really quickly and interferes with the shredding once it gets close to the top. If your looking for a light duty junk mail shredder and don't want to spend too much money then this is a good shredder to own. I have owned mine since 2009 and two years later its still working fine but if you get alot of junk mail or want something that won't jam no matter what you throw at it then you should get a heavy duty shredder instead.

Pros
--------
- Cheap
- Tears up a single credit card no problem
- Tears up paper clips and staples along with 4-6 papers without any problem
- Pretty durable, I have owned mine for two years and its still working.

Cons
--------
- Basket fills up quickly and will jam when theres not enough space in between the shredder and the basket.
- Jams when you try to shred thick envelopes containing booklets inside like a customer agreement.
- Cant shred DVD's or too many papers at once.
- Its really hard to unclog when it gets jammed.

Conclusion
--------------
If your looking for something light duty that can handle up to 8 papers at once, 1 credit card at a time, or 4-6 papers stapled or paper clipped together at a time then this is a good bargain shredder to own. If you need something stronger that will handle anything you throw at it then spend a little more money on a 17+ page heavy duty shredder instead and you won't have to buy a shredder agian when you outgrow this one.",10,11.5280695

I might consider the printer, but designing a firmware update that is operating system specific is quite stupid as: 1) there is no good reason to do so; 2) Leopard is not exactly a recent development; 3) if the firmware update was important for the product to work properly (which one would presume to be the case), then making it work should be something of a priority.

Another reviewer pointed out -- and I agree -- that as a general rule, it is initially easier to set up a network device using a cable connection. Unfortunately, I was unable to do this at first. I connected directly to the router, but the router didn't see the printer, and the network activity lights on the ethernet port didn't show any activity. This was frustrating. I spent hours and hours attempting different set ups: wired, wireless, all the ways in the manual. Among these was an attempt at ""Easy Set-Up"" on my Linksys WRT54GS wireless router, which also failed. (Interestingly, the router's Cisco logo, which used to be illuminated, is now no longer illuminated since attempting the Easy Set Up. Why? I have no idea ...). I re-read both the manual and all the different internet posts on this set-up numerous times. The secret is contained in a third reviewer's post.

This worked for me:
1. If you have already attempted an install, UNinstall the drivers. Do this FIRST.
2. Turn off the power to your Brother 2170w.
3. Turn off your Windows Firewall in your security settings (Start>Control Panel>Security Center).
4. Re-set the printer's internal print server!!
-  a. Holding down the blue GO button with the power OFF, turn the power on.
-  b. Make sure all the LED's illuminate (toner/drum/error)
-  c. Release the GO button, then press it seven times in succession
--  i. The manual says that the LEDs should illuminate again, demonstrating the reset was successful
--  ii. My LED's did NOT illuminate again, but the reset was successful anyway
5. Connect the cable between your router and the printer's ethernet port
6. Run the CD
7. Select Wireless Network Setup
8. Select Wireless Setup and Driver Install
-  a. initial computer only
-  b. for all subsequent computers select Driver Install Only
9. Select Step By Step
10. Select With Cable
11. Make sure that your router detects the printer by illuminating the LED for the selected port when cable connected
12. Look at the ethernet port on the printer and ensure the LED's are illuminated when cable connected
-  a. If none of the LEDs are illuminated, go back to resetting the internal print server again (step 4 above)
13. Click Next once your cable is connected until the software detects the Available Wireless Device
14. Follow the rest of the steps from page 23 of the manual (step 10)

The edges on the left and right on one of trays easily broke due to the weak quality of the wood and the staples that had been used mostly cracked the wood instead of securing it.

I got out my long wood clamps and the wood glue and fixed it like it should have come from the factory.  It is far stronger now and better.  Since we don't use these trays to put onto our laps and we use them beside the bed to set light weight items on there is no reason for tray to break under such a light duty.

They serve a purpose but don't be surprised if yours breaks.  They are easy to fix and frankly I would glue them before they broke because it is inevitable that it will.",2,4.9828744

4585,"Canon has produced printer that is loaded with features, economically priced for the home market.  It is very easy to set-up and hook into your home wireless network.  The printing is very good.  Although called a Photo Printer, the only feature I have been a little disappointed in is the photo printing (It is the only area I would give it 4 stars).  It does not do quite as well when compared to my older Epson R380.  However, if I did not have the head-to-head comparison, I probably would not have been as aware of the differences.
The scanner is very easy to use.  It automatically launches the scanner software on your computer.  It can either scan quickly using the preset options (the vast majority of my needs), or it can be customized easily for specific settings of size, color, quality, etc.
For a compact printer, it has conveniently, 2 different paper loading trays, double-sided printing (which saves space and paper), memory card, USB connections, and much more.

4586,"Do not buy this item. This is a very nice ruler... unfortunately they stuck the product barcode sticker onto my new ""CLEAR"" ruler. This is one of those stickers that is very difficult to remove. After 20 minutes there is still a sticky glue/mess on the bottom side of my ruler. I can't even slide it across a piece of paper because the left end of the ruler where the sticker was sticks to the paper.  I mean really??? Didn't anyone think that maybe I was buying this CLEAR ruler for a reason?? That maybe a big white sticker stuck to the bottom side of this ruler might defeat the purpose?
This came in what I call a clear throwaway case. Just a suggestion... Maybe you could put the barcode sticker on the case. Genius! and NOT PUT IT ON THE BOTTOM OF THE ""CLEAR"" RULER! Just a thought.
One more thing. Rule number one in business... convenience/speed. People want it now, not a week or 2 after they order it.

4589,"First of all, I really want to love this machine because it would solve several problems for me. For one, I'm a writer and the 30ppm laser printing *really* appeals to me big time. Being able to print that fast means that I can print out 100 pages of a manuscript in a little over three minutes. Yikes, that is fast. Years ago I used an Apple Laserwriter (I still have it if anyone wants it--I just stopped using it, I forget why) and I loved it: fast, quiet and beautiful (beautiful!) printing. Also, while I have three Epson printers (two are high-end photo-quality printers) and two Epson flatbed scanners already in my home office, the idea of having a scanner/fax/copier and laser printer in one machine, well, talk about paradise. OK, that's the dream. Getting there, for someone as admittedly computer ignorant as me is not such a beautiful road.

But let's start with some rudimentary stuff about this machine (and Ricoh). For one, I despise that the manual is only on pdf. Holy cow. Aren't we past that little money-saving madness yet? This machine comes with like a 60-page PRINTED safety manual, but the operating manual is only on CD in pdf form (and it's nearly 300 pages, so I'll NEED a 300ppm printer to get a hard copy any time soon!). There are a few printed quick-start guides (in more languages than I can count--and exactly what is the point of that? Aren't there enough U.S./Canadian buyers to give us separate documentation in English only?), but they are what all quick-start guides are: terse and with mediocre illustrations.

Also, unless I am missing something, there is no Mac driver for this printer. What? It's a printer driver, why isn't there a Mac version written? We're just talking about adding some code here, it's not that big a deal. My primary computer is a Mac desktop tower and I really wanted to install it to that computer. I do have a Windows laptop and, after a frustrating search for a Mac driver, I had to connect this printer to my router (TPLink, 2-channel) via Ethernet cable and then install the printer on the laptop and configure everything from that. The trouble is that I only do research on the laptop, my writing is done on the Mac. So, in order to print (my fantasy, remember?) big documents, first I have to share them to the laptop, then print them via the wireless set up. And let me tell you, that wireless set up was no piece of cake either! Had I not had a friend here helping me, there is no way on this Earth I would have ever gotten though the set up. And if it fails at some point, I'll never be able to fix it on my own.

But there simply MUST be Mac drivers for this (and if you own this printer and know where they are hidden, please let me know) because what about all the Mac laptop users out there? iPads? I must be missing something--and I'm sure it's *MY* fault.

I also think the wireless instructions are written in some dead language: they were obviously written for the IT guy at your corporate office to interpret. For a home user like me, I just stared in disbelief. I'm really surprised that everyone here is saying it's so ""easy"" to set up. C'mon over, I could use the help!

Also, do not underestimate the WEIGHT of this thing. Holy cats, it's around 40 lbs and you need a very stable desk to put that on. Right now I have it on the floor--just to be sure it doesn't bring down my desk. I have a huge Epson 2200 printer that weighs like 10 lbs.

OK, once it got going, I will say that the printer prints beautifully, copies very nicely. And the controls are very logical: if you've used a copy machine at Staples or the library, this will all seem very familiar to you. And I like the fact that the paper tray holds 200+ (250, I think) sheets of paper. That's great. My go-to Epson only holds around 80 sheets, I think. And the ADF (automatic document feeder) works nicely. I actually expected it to jam but it didn't.

So, anyway, I think that once I get a driver for my Mac (if there is one) and can print directly from that computer and once I find a table that doesn't get week-in-the-knees from the weight, I think I'll grow to love this mutli-function printer/scanner. But at the moment I'm so exhausted from watching someone help me set it up and not having a clue what he's doing that I'm a bit afraid of it.

Curious to know if anyone else is using this directly from a Mac and what I missed in the set up. Oh, also, there was earlier confusion when this was described as a color printer, which it obviously is not. This will scan in color, but it only prints in B&W. It's essentially a document printer--and, once you get there, a pretty good one. I want to give this two stars because I think the documentation is horrid and I hate that it's only on CD (I'd love to just read it sitting on the couch, in print form--and to be able to highlight things) and because of the Mac thing, but I have a feeling much of this is my own fault, so for now, I'll be generous and give it three stars. But I will update this review a few times as I learn more about the set up and the features.",3,9.311643

4592,"I've had this printer for about 2 yrs now. It's been a reliable quality printer. I use it in my office as an everyday printer, and I chose this particular model because of what I perceived to be it's photo printing abilities. It makes excellent photos and makes speedy print-outs in the fast/economical mode. I'm very happy with the purchase. If it had room for the 3 ink cartridges I use (black, tri-color and tri-color photo) instead of having to switch the color when doing photos, it would be more convenient, but not a major problem. I just try to set aside a time when I have several pictures to print and do them at the same time. The paper tray has a tendency to eject multiple sheets at once when printing in the fast/economical mode for everyday paper printing. It's less so when the tray is full. I would purchase it again. Although the instructions are almost non-existant and don't cover this, I have found the printer works best if the feed rollers are cleaned occasionally with finger and/or dry cloth. Otherwise the buildup will pull little bits of the photo finish off of the paper, leaving white spots in the print.",2,9.119672

We have had art tables and easels in our house for years.  One was from IKEA, another from Step 2 and one from Melissa and Doug.  This table from ALEX toys is all you need.  First off, there is very little to construct.  Second, it comes with everything shown except for crayons/arts supplies.  It has a roll of paper ready to go as well as the buckets and mesh bag.  I love the benches.  Big enough for Mom or Dad to sit across from a child or you can fit 4 little friends at the same time.  My 14yr old and 6yr old can both sit here and work on things together.  My 6yr old is 4ft tall and it looks like she still has a few years left sitting comfortable.  Be sure to ""chalk"" up the chalk board first - read the directions!  If you don't, the chalk does not really stick well.  I see those complaints on these reviews but that was from lack of reading directions and not the manufacturers fault.  It cleans up well with wipes.  It is also a great table for play-doh.  The roll of paper comes out smooth and my 6yr old can cut the paper and tighten a new one with ease.  Her trying to do the easel roll was a waste.  The paper supplied is a new white thick paper.  It doesn't feel like cheap construction paper.  You can use finger paints or regular paints with it, without it bleeding thru.  The benches fit underneath the table and we added two bins on either side.  One below the mesh holder and another below the buckets.  One stores play-doh and the other stores extra paper, arts/crafts and puzzles.  I would highly recommend this for anyone with kids, especially multiple kids.  The price may be high but the longevity of this item and how well it is made, makes up for that and it will be worth it in the long run.  You can even use bed raisers to raise the table up once your children get older.",2,8.810253
4616,"My wife tasked me with finding new wireless phones for the house, and I chose these, Panasonic KX-TG6645B. The system comes with a base and five handsets.

The first great thing about this system is that its rechargeable batteries are standard 1.5V AAA NiMh, so when the batteries eventually lose their ability to hold charge, replacement will be easy and cost-effective. I hadn't realized that when I bought the system, so right out of the box this was a really pleasant surprise.

Setting the phones up was easy. Everything paired up to the base unit without any particular setup on my part. I would have appreciated a short (6"" or so) phone cable to connect the base unit to the wall plate phone jack we have. Fortunately, I had one from the previous phone, but there was none in the box, just the regular 3-footer. So, if you will be mounting your base unit on a wall jack, be sure to get a short cable into your order as well.

The intercom feature is great. You can call from station to station, and right off the bat my wife and I started using them as walkie-talkies when I was doing some electrical work around the house and needed to locate the right breaker in the basement for a circuit in a third-floor bedroom.

Voice clarity is great. You can set the ringtone and ring volume separately on each unit, which is great for guest rooms or areas of the house where you don't want ringing but do want a phone handy.

The base station has a couple of interesting features. First of all, with the handset removed, it's still a fully functional speakerphone for outside and intercom calls--it's basically a sixth phone in the kit, as long as you don't mind talking on speakerphone. When the handset is in the base cradle, the handset battery will power the base in the event of a power failure, allowing the base answering machine functions to continue to work.

We don't use the answering system on this kit, because we have voicemail from our voice provider, so I can't comment on its features, although others have pointed out some shortcomings. I actually was out looking for a system with no answering at all, but that proved elusive; this system allows the answering system to be disabled, so it functions fine.

So, to the subject of this review, my wife tasked me with finding something great, and I feel like I really found it, at a great price. She loves it, especially since even our five year-old has no trouble operating the intercom feature and can call Mom or answer as needed.

Truly great product and a great value for the modest price.",2,12.137669

I use this for a data base for my DVD collection, games and the calendar/alarm. It keeps a good charge, but I've noticed as they get older they need charged more often.

This is my second because I messed up my first and I'm still happy with it. I've read that the OS system could be updated, but for my needs it is just fine.

4630,"I really had high expectations for these pens. I am new to handlettering- which is obvious in attached pic. I have been playing around with it for a while and had read that these pens are great for beginners. I got them today and busted them out and was frustrated right away. As you can see, the ink flow is that of a marker that is getting ready to run out of ink. It didn't improve much upon using a couple more times. I am not sure if I just got a dud set, or if this is standard, but I would say that there might be better options out there for you :)",4,4.524944

There would be bubbles and it never looked good. Forget professional, it didn't even look good for an amateur product.  I ended up going back to my Royal Sovereign for $80 but it's worth it.  This one was a waste of $20 for me.  I don't expect professional results - I wanted one because I use it often to preserve my kid's certificates and things of that nature.  This machine wouldn't even do that.  The RS one I had before never failed, and it only broke because I put something too thick in it. This machine may have a reverse (my RS did not) but that's not enough to make up for all it lacks.  If there were negative stars, I would have gone that route - 1 star was the lowest I could go.",3,3.8920105
4632,"Bought this to replace a Uniden system that had started being very staticky after several years of use.  I bought this system because I've had Panasonc phones in the past, and know they are mostly well made products, and because this can block up to 250 phone numbers.  The Uniden could block only 20, and we needed way more than that.

As with most Panasonic phones, the set up and menus are more complicated than necessary, but once you get used to using it, it isn't that bad.  Just wish there were less steps needed to do anything with it.  The phone itself provides good, clear voice sound, even at lower volumes, but it also has a voice boost function that makes voices even clearer, an important feature if you have older ears, like mine, though I have yet to need that.

You also can connect two mobile phones to this phone and use them to upload your phone book, which is a wonderful time saver, and once the mobile phone is connected, you can use the Panasonic phone to talk on your mobile phone.  This is especially nice if you have poor cell reception in your home.  It also states you can do this even without a landline connection.  We don't need this, so I only connected my mobile phone to upload the phone book, then disconnected it.  Connecting and disconnecting was very easy to do.

The answer machine function works well, voice play back is very clear.  The speaking caller ID functions very well, and is very clear, other than the robot voice.

There are other things the phone is capable of doing, but our needs are fairly basic and I didn't bother with trying them.  This is a very good phone system, with excellent sound on the base and all the extensions from anywhere in our home.  We love that Block button and have to use it all too frequently.  I'll probably be looking for a new phone that blocks more than a thousand numbers eventually.

I highly recommend this phone if you don't mind a complicated set up and menu system, which is why I deducted one star.  The many capabilities and function of this phone system far outweigh that minor annoyance.",2,7.4799657

I thought this would be a bit difficult and more of a fine point for me. I was wrong! This pen writes very smoothly, and even comes out looking like at least a medium point. I actually will have no problem using this pen! I had a sneaking suspicion that my boyfriend, the artist of the two of us-may even be able to use this for his own purposes. I was right!

Our second printer is an Epson. We now only use it for the rare color printout. The rest we send to the laser printer. We no longer buy third party ink because of the damage done to our ink jet printers. So this 410XL is a standard Epson OEM cartridge.

I do not recommend this item unless you just want to see how something will look before doing with with a website or something that may be costly. It is unfortunate because once you get it right, it looks pretty good (though blacks never look fully black) and would be acceptable if it would stay on.

The only issue that bugs me is that it has a high pitched whine when it is in sleep mode.

I threw my money away on these. I wouldn't have liked them even if they didn't come all creased up because they're smaller than depicted and. when I tested chalk markers, they didn't wipe clean. You get what you pay for I guess. I ordered a different chalkboard sheet roll and am going to try that out today and will post a review when I see how that goes. At least it is in great condition!

4644,"These are exactly what comes in a Fisher Space Pen from the factory. So, they might as well call them factory replacements. They are great refills that come packaged with an adapter to fit multiple types of pens. I've found that, with the adapter, these refills will fit several different pens, not just Fisher brand. So, in theory, that turns most any pen into a Space Pen that can write upside-down and underwater. I know the practicality of writing underwater and upside-down doesn't really mesh or relate to many people, especially on a daily basis but, I'm a teacher and sometimes you get caught in the hallway or on your way down the stairs or were ever and you have to place a sheet of paper on the wall. This is the only pen that I have that can allow me to write while holding the paper against the wall.

4645,"I bought this printer exactly 5 years ago today.  At that time, I paid 1/5 of the price it's currently being sold for (I paid $129.99 with free shipping).  It was a good printer for a long time at that price.  There is no way it's worth anywhere near the price it's sold for now.

Keep in mind that ink cartridges are expensive and you'll go through them often.  And then if you don't print often enough, the print heads will dry out and clog and then you'll need to either try to manually clean them (very difficult with this printer), pay someone to clean them, or toss it and get a new printer (many websites actually say that this is the cheapest fix for epson printers because this problem is so common and so hard to remedy!).  I didn't print with mine often because ink was so expensive, but that meant that the printer worked worse and worse.  It printed with lines through everything, so I turned it up to high quality printing to get even close to legible print.  Then it got to the point where even then it was full of empty spaces.  Now it won't print anything except things that are supposed to be teal.

The bottom line is that an epson printer is worth about $100 but be prepared to spend a LOT on ink and to make sure to print a lot (in color and black and white) if you don't want costly repairs from the ink heads clogging.  And even then, be aware of the fact that printers today seem to be designed to break often so you have to keep buying new.",2,8.713225

I purchased this card holder since my coworkers were bugging me about my stack of business cards. All in all I am pleased, good quality for the price.

Faux Leather Cover: The cover feels like a soft leather and the stitching around the edges is well done. Metal protectors prevent the corners from getting bent in or fraying. The cover does tend to pick up finger oils very easily so after a few days of use, it tends to look streaky. The upper folded edge did crumple a bit, but the card holder still looks good from the outside.

Inside: The plastic on the card holders is stiff enough to take some abuse but thin enough to allow the sheets to fold. Each sheet can hold up to 8 business cards (4x front, 4x back) 12 alphabetical place holder cards are provided to help organize the card holder, note that these are already in the slots when it arrives.

One, as a traditional door stop to prevent the doorknob from denting the wall; and two, to prevent the bedroom doors from slamming shut whenever it got a little breezy with the windows open. Honestly I got tired of dragging whatever heavy object I could find in front of the door to keep it open.

These are very well made for the price, and more attractive than those with the big clunky exposed magnet. They mounted in minutes with no exposed screws.

No need to be concerned if you have hollow doors, most interior doors these days are hollow. Every door has a solid wood perimeter (its called a rail) of usually about 2-3.  And the best place to mount the catch is just inside the top corner of the door where it has plenty of rail for the included screws to hold it securely. See my photo to get an idea where to mount the catch.

Mounting the doorstop is optional whether you choose to put it at the top or bottom of the door. For aesthetics some people may choose not to have it visible on the wall. In my case because the strong breeze from the window is more apt to hit the top of the door that was a better place to have the door stop. Mounting it at the top also helps avoid accidentally kicking the door stop and makes it a little easier to vacuum, but again that is strictly a personal choice.

I inserted a check, sealed the flaps and held the envelope up to a small (4"" diameter) fluorescent desk lamp.  I could read every word and number on the check as easily as if the envelope had no security printing.

Unfortunately Mead's self-stick envelopes don't seal well enough either, and the paper they're made of is much too thin and flimsy.",3,10.29851
4681,"This printer has just about everything you could ever need:
- prints 48 pages per minute (in duplex)
- faxes
- scans
- copies
- has a 3,000 or 8,000 page toner cartridge
- can hold 500 pages

In my experience with this thing, it works flawlessly and it was plug and play (make sure you remove the toner cartridge protection and all tapes, etc before plugging it in).  If you're in a shared office, you can also program it so that only MFC equipped users can use it which is really nice.  All the features are super easy to use on the nearly 5"" color touchscreen display.

NOTE ON WIFI
- I have this printer working with a hardwire Cat6 cable.  WIFI on Brother printers is super easy to use, BUT you have to follow the instructions carefully. Do not throw your instructions away, you will need them later.  This is a lesson I learned the hard way with not just Brother printers but with viturally all WIFI printers. You have to follow their directions explicitly.  Fortunately for me Brother has online documentation on all their printers so if you ever lose your instructions you can go online and get them. In any case, WIFI on this printer works great but I have it next to a hardwire LAN port so I might as well hardwire it in.

Overall, extremely satisfied with this product.  The full size toner cartridges really do make a big difference in the cost of ownership.

Oh, this printer also comes with Amazon Dash so it can automatically order a toner cartridge when it needs one.",2,7.6257977
4682,"What everyone else said is true. The password feature is a bit weird. The buttons are strong and I like that. What I don't like is that it's very hard to see the numbers and therefore if you are locked out at night with little to no light, you are in trouble. The box is very strong, but I'm not happy with how it is installed to a surface. My advice is to take extra care to find a base for this so that it either doesn't fall off or gets taken off wherever you plan to put it. Mine only came with screws to bolt it down. But I built a stronger base so that it wouldn't be easy to rip off.

The box itself is heavy and durable. It feels really safe. It's easy to install, easy to get setup. It has some issues and to me isn't perfect out of the box, but I like it well enough.",2,4.2564273
4683,"The Amazon Basics Shredder is definitely among a class of products that deserves recognition for its outstanding performance. And I say that simply because Ive already put it through its paces in regards to shredding absolutely everything from old credit cards to large manila envelopes stuffed with old paperwork.
I had been in the market to purchase a shredder for both personal and business use, as I sometimes take work home with me, and needed something a little larger than normal that would shred very well.  And I was not disappointed in that regard.
When I received the box, I did notice immediately two large holes in the box itself, but luckily the product was fine.  I do love Amazon frustration free packaging, because there is no massive undertaking of trying to get to find your product in a mess of bubble wrap, or having to dispose of the immense shipping material later. Although at times when you find two large holes in your package, you do wish for a little more protection.

But with that being said, it was a breeze to get the shredder out and start using it!  There was only a crate holding the top and bottom portion secure with a  plastic bag over the whole device, and once I pushed the bag down, it was easy to slide it right out.  The shredder does come with everything already attached and in working order with no assembly whatsoever.

The shredder itself is very sleek in design with a large interface that is very user friendly.  The top portion features a large power button with a green light that stays lit when the device is turned on, a large rewind button and forward button that, when pressed, will have the blades turning backward or forward for a few seconds, a panel that will indicate whether the door is open to the shredder, if the device is overloaded or overheated, and, again, if the power is turned on as well as housing the area where the shredding material will go into.  I do like the look of this as the blades are deep into the device, unlike small shredders, to help prevent accidents, and the page insert area is angled in the front for easy access.  The Amazon Basics shredder also has handles on each side that make it very easy to handle the device.  There are wheels on the bottom that also make it very easy to pull one way or another, and the power cord in the back has enough slack to move it closer to me if I need to while its still plugged in.  Lastly, the front of the device has a small inward built handle that, with a quick tug, pulls out the tub where the shredded material goes to.  This space is deep, and quite large, and even with all the shredding Ive already done I still haven't filled it halfway yet.

The shredder will shred up to 24 sheets of paper at a time, and I have attested to the fact that it really does!  I had a pile of junk mail, old bills, and some work material that I needed to shred that included things such as a manila envelopes full of receipts, a manila folder with paperwork inside, a stack of stapled papers, and unopened junk mail.  And it easily shredded everything!  But my favorite thing about this shredder is that it also shreds CDs, DVDS, and credit cards!  I always hated taking a pair of scissors to an old card, and this shredder totally eliminates that aggravation!  I also tried some old CDs, and it shredded everything perfectly with no jams whatsoever.

As Im used to my works very large shredder, and know the mess of dealing with tiny fragments of paper, I will say I immediately grabbed a small plastic trash bag, and managed to fit it around the outside lip of the tub to where I would have an easy and quick mess free cleaning.  I did end up with the overlap sticking out the front, but as this will be used in my home I don't mind the look of it. There is also no sleep function to this shredder, but I simply turn it on when I need to shred something, and normally turn it off later when Im done.  It is a bit noisier than higher end shredders, but it definitely does the job, and does it well!

I would completely recommend this shredder to anyone who either brings work home with them, for a small business, or for the person who has a lot of continuous personal information theyd like to safely get rid of.  Its definitely not for the average household who only needs to shred junk mail so keep that in mind as this is a large device made to take on a small workload each week.",2,11.500424

4687,"*Note: Amazon gives me only 30 days to review this product, so I'll need to update the review once/if I actually start using it come January.

For several years I have been using Moleskine planners: their sturdy, hard-bound covers hold up well in my backpack on my way to campus to teach and work. My complaint with these planners (and the reason I wanted to try something new) is twofold: first, the paper quality in ""regular"" Moleskines is not suitable to wet inks (such as fountain pens), since the ink tends to feather or bleed through the pages. Second, Moleskine planners of most varieties tend to have a lot of ""extra"" stuff between the front cover and the actual planning spaces (airport codes, measurement conversions, long-term trip planners, etc.). I don't really need or want any of this since Google is, well, at the fingertips most of the time. (One of my smaller Moleskine planners, which is basically a pocket notebook, one book for each month, has for its pages roughly HALF of this extra material for EACH month.)

On to the At-A-Glance.

This planner is larger than what I am used to having, though it is still (slightly) smaller than a regular 8.5x11 sheet of copy paper. This bit of smallness is actually a drawback for me: it means I can't stick in pieces of paper without actually cutting or folding them. As for the ""extra"" material that I complained about with the Moleskines, the AAG has virtually none -- and that's a good thing. Open the cover, and you get a large, lined page. Flip this page, and you're onto the monthly view of January. Flip *this* page, and you're onto the first weekly view of January. The result is that while it's a longer and wider book, it's quite a bit thinner than the daily view Moleskine planner.

Next, the paper quality. I've tested the AAG using Noodler's inks in a Lamy extra-fine tip fountain pen. I've used a pretty ""bleedy"" ink (""Bay State Blue"") for this bleed-through test, just to see what AAG can handle, and then went to a ""normal"" ink (blue-black). I'm pleased to write that the AAG's paper -- although just as thin as Moleskine paper -- does just fine with both of these. While I can see that there *is* writing on the other side of the test sheet, there doesn't seem to be any actual bleed-through. Things worked equally well with a watered-down ""Apache Sunset"" ink, and also with the supreme test: an Artwin ""oriental blue"" art marker (notorious for darkly bleeding through just about anything -- but not the AAG paper).

Thus, the AAG seems very promising to me as next year's planner. It has the ""Moleskine"" covers I like (complete with cover strap and ribbon bookmark), yet doesn't have the negative qualities I mention above. The ONE thing I really don't like is the ""HOT"" section found on the bottom of each weekly-view page -- presumably for ""hot"" to-do items that week. I wish they would have just left out this ""HOT"" and let the user fill in whatever she wants. In all, I ""like"" it (4 stars), but I don't yet ""love"" it (5 stars). For that, time will tell.",5,14.647766

4689,"I bought this phone because I needed a phone that would give me better range than my panasonic 5.8gHz model without the interference with my computer equipment. I live in a pretty good sized house, ( 3 stories, 6000 sq. ft., lots of steel too). My 5.8 gHz model didn't quite cut it for range from one side of the house to the other. I really started seeing problems when they installed my wireless network for the house. I did some research and found out that the interference issue was common with 5.8 gHz and the wireless router because they operate on the same bandwidth and therefore can have some interference issues. As for the range, I was out of luck until I found this phone that has an included "" range extender "". Set-up for the phone was very easy, ( 6 steps including "" insert batteries and charge for 7 hours""). I put the range extender at about the distance where my 5.8 gHz started to fuzz out. This is easily installed as well. All you need is a power outlet, no phone jack. After the charging period, I tried the phone everywhere in the house with no issues. I can even go down to the lake to watch the kids with no issues. Also, from reading the directions, I noted that you can add one more range extender to increase your range even more. I think panasonic really got the idea right when they made this phone and included the range extender. I would have to say that my only disappointment is the handset display size and that it is not in color. If you are looking for a solid phone system with great range and no computer interference issues, you can't go wrong with this phone. Buy it! You won't be sorry.",157,9.870234
4690,"This phone is an inexpensive & descent phone with a speaker. It works well except for the caller ID. The Caller Id wire that attaches to the phone is so fragile that it keeps breaking. I have been very gentle with it. AT&T is not helpful in replacing this caller Id wire connection. They have been out of stock every time I call. Without it the phone is pointless to me. If you don't mind the caller Id not working then this phone might be for you. I have had to buy another phone ( ATT CL2939) that has batteries instead of a the caller Id wire and it works much better ( batteries and no Caller Id wire, and the base of the phone does not fall off as it did with this model I am reviewing)  I do not recommend a phone that has the caller ID wire rather than the batteries for two reasons. One the wire is too fragile and breaks frequently and it is hard to replace this wire. Two, the caller id wire tethers you to the exact location you pick up the phone rather than being able to walk around with the phone.",2,8.10805

There is a slight smell, but it's not too bad. However, I still laminate outside when I can. New units may have more of a smell at first.

The customer service there is AMAZING, so if you buy a printer from them, you can be assured that they stand by their product.  All that said, WHY DID I WAIT THIS LONG TO BUY ONE?!?! As a props person in theatre, paper items, letters, photos and **newspapers** are generally very specific and usually made in multiples.  Newspapers in particular are one of the most challenging things, because newsprint paper isn't an option at your local Kinko's, and the right size pages for a newspaper are *far* too big for a regular printer. Until this point, I've had to piece together 8-8/12 x 14 pieces of paper and glue them together and settle for that.  Now, I can print tabloid-size papers with ease, and piecing larger papers is a snap.  Even on draft mode, which saves ink, the print is crisp and clear. Printing photos is easy, and although sometimes the colors in Photoshop and other programs seem to vary slightly with what is printed - for projects that involve expensive papers, you should ALWAYS print a draft page on something cheap - it's awesome to be able to print portraits and other artwork with ease. Because it's wireless I can now have my printer in a much more convenient spot, and I have tons more desktop real estate to work with.

a spiral binding to lay flat with no spine covering so the book can be wrapped around
a weekly format to record a few daily events and see the whole week at time

very dark lines for writing your daily notes

My preferences are:
The spine listing above is great, exactly what I wanted
The weekly format is very helpful
the monthly calendar is great but it helps to see a 3 month view, either last-current-next or current-next-next is better than just the current month. OK, I can overlook this but I tend to use the big wall calender because I don't have this right on the page. The big wall calendar is BEHIND me so I just need to turn around.

The dark lines for writing are distracting. Not everyone writes in the same size so faint lines are best. The pages also have flourishes as a back ground design, this is great and jazzes up the page a bit, but the flourishes on white paper are also distracting.

The ink doesn't bleed through pages and won't smudge easily when dried. As silly as this might sound, the blue is nice to look at (not super dark but not too light either).

The rubber grip tends to have tiny nubs sticking out when you'll find yourself fiddling with on occasion - they can be trimmed but nobody ever bothers. I suspect this is a byproduct from the molding process but it has no impact on the quality of the pen.

One feature I really liked about the printer was the included batch of photo paper which printed surprisingly well. The print quality on standard paper was also good, and the printing speed was quick: especially for double sided prints. Nothing spectacular, but the quality is what to be expected. The printer has yet to jam after about 50 pieces of paper have run through. Taking a look at the internals of the printer, jams look to be easy to clear with a rear access door.

4703,"I'm sure just about everyone has heard of Skype.  It is an Internet communication service that allows you to make free calls to other Skype users or very low cost calls to landline phones.  This service utilizes your computer and a broadband Internet connection (although there are some new devices that no longer require a computer to make Skype calls) to establish communication with other Skype subscribers and landline phones through a peer-to-peer network.  To fully utilize and enjoy Skype, the market is flooded with products that work with this service.  One of these products is the C100S Communicator by Polycom.

The C100S Communicator is a portable speakerphone, which connects to your computer via a USB cable.  This speakerphone does not require batteries or an external power supply.  The USB connection supplies both the audio communication and power for the device.  The lack of needing batteries or an AC power supply makes the C100S a very compact and perfectly portable device.  In fact, there is very little to this device other than the main unit itself.  The entire Polycom Communicator C100S package includes the Communicator unit itself, a Setup Wizard CD, a user guide and a handy neoprene carrying case.  That's all there is to it.  The USB cable, needed to connect the C100S to your computer, is built into the communicator itself and wraps up in the storage area of the device (located on the backside) when not in use.  The communicator slips into the included carrying case and can be tucked in a drawer between uses.

Installation of the C100S is very simple and straightforward.  You insert the Setup Wizard CD into your computer and follow the onscreen instructions.  When prompted, you flip open the back the back cover of the C100S, unwind the USB cable, sit the unit on a flat surface and connect the USB cable to an available USB port on your computer.  You then follow the rest of the on-screen instructions, which complete the driver and software installation.  In order to use the Polycom C100S you will need to have Skype installed on your computer.  Since the C100S becomes your default Windows audio device, when plugged in, you can control the speaker volume and microphone levels from the Windows audio mixer.  You can also adjust the speaker volume with the volume up and down buttons on the front of the C100S itself.  The other buttons on the Communicator control mute, answer and hang-up calls, and there is a special button for launching the Skype application on your computer (button has a capital ""S"" on it).  The installed software includes the Polycom C100S Manager, which allows you to test the microphone, speaker and LED functionality, allow you to check for software updates, provides an interactive tour of the C100S Communicator, and even includes a link for downloading the Skype software.

Some of the most important specifications of the C100S Communicator are as follows:

*  Size:  5.25 x 3.24 x 0.85 inches
* Weight  -  5.4 ounces
* System Interface  -  USB 1.1
* Keypad  -  Call Pick-up/Hand-up key, Skype Application Launch key, Volume Up/Down keys , Mute key, and LED light-ring for indication of call status
* Speaker Frequency Response  -  300 Hz to 19 kHz
* Microphones - 2 Cardioid Microphones  -  200 Hz to 20 kHz
* Auxiliary Audio Output  -  3.5 mm Headphone Jack
* Audio Enhancements  -  Echo Cancellation, Automatic Gain Control, Dynamic Noise Reduction
* Communication Type  -  Full Duplex
* Recommended Room Size  -  12 x 12 ft. or less
* Warranty  -  12 Months

To use the C100S Communicator, your computer system must meet the following minimum system requirements:

-  PC with 1 GHz processor
- Windows XP
- 256 MB RAM
- 30 MB hard disk space available for installation
- CD-ROM drive
- Available USB connection
- Internet connection
- Skype version 2.0 or higher

You'll notice that use of the C100S Communicator requires Windows XP.  Although Polycom claims that it is working on drivers for Windows Vista, as of the time of this review the device is only compatible with Windows XP.  This is unfortunate as most of today's new computers come preloaded with Windows Vista.  This particular device is also not compatible with MAC operating systems.  With this being said, the C100S will indeed work with Vista and MAC operating systems, but it will only work as a standard speaker and microphone.  The buttons will likely not function properly and the software audio enhancements, such as echo cancellation and automatic gain control will not work since they cannot be installed.  Hopefully Polycom will improve on OS compatibility in the near future.

Using the C100S Communicator is easy and trouble free.  All of the control buttons on the device work as claimed, and the sound quality of the speaker is very impressive.  The twin microphone pickup seems to work well, although callers have reported that my voice is sometimes a bit soft.  I always have to crank up the microphone input on the Windows audio mixer, to make sure that the input level is adequate for my Skype calls.  I also find the built-in USB cable to be a little too short.  It measures about 2  feet in length, which requires me to sit the C100S on the very edge of my desk when I have it plugged into the computer, which is pushed back under the desk.  The USB cable is also very thin, which concerns me about its durability over time.  Just wrapping it up in the storage compartment of the C100S leaves some pretty sharp kinks in the cable.  Since the cable is built into the Communicator, there is no way to install a replacement; at least not without taking apart the device and voiding the warranty.  I have gotten past the short cord length by using a USB extension cable, but this is not an ideal solution in my opinion.  Using a detachable USB cable would have been a better way for Polycom to design the C100S.

Overall I am extremely pleased with the Polycom C100S Communicator.  It is light, compact and easy to transport.  Installation of the device and associated software is painless and can be accomplished by even the moderately computer challenged.  The sound quality is awesome and the echo cancelation feature prevents annoying feedback during calls.  The built-in 3.5 mm output jack allows you to plug in headphones and external amplified speakers.  The microphones are still active when you plug in a headset or speakers, so I am able to slip on some earphones for late night Skype calls, while my family sleeps without being disturbed by sound from the speaker.  Other than my desire for a user replaceable USB cable, I have no complaints with the C100S Communicator.  It is a bit pricey for modest Skype users, but for anyone that uses Skype extensively this device is a must have.  The sound quality, audio enhancement features, easy installation and portability are worth 5 stars.  However, the lack of Windows Vista support and the subpar USB cable require that I bump this rating down to 4 stars.  If you have a Windows XP machine and use Skype a great deal, the Polycom C100S would be a great investment and I highly recommend it.",5,14.241423

4706,"I had been using Kodak film and paper for over 40 years, and now am truly saddened by what has happened to what was an American institution. I saw the end of film, evidently before Kodak did. But I still believed that their paper would be top quality as it has been for the 60 years (yes, 60) that I used Kodak paper. I don't know why, but in comparing Kodak to HP Premium Plus Photo Paper, HP gets 4.5 stars and Kodak 2. With Kodak, I've had some bleeding problems and, few though they may be, an 8x10 uses a lot of ink - expensive ink - and to toss a photo because of bleeding or fading or crinkling is just too expensive and disappointing for me.

It's not all about money, but it it's certainly the major factor. Still, when used on an Epson or HP printer, Kodak paper just doesn't live up to the claims of the company. While I have had to let others dry for a day (to be safe) so they won't stick to frames or other photos, Kodak seems to need even more time.

I've had some fading which just should not be. But perhaps the worst problem is slippage and ultimate crinkling or printing off-center.

I have not used this on a Kodak printer. The only Kodak printer I purchased did not work, and I returned it and bought a Canon. Now that that has broken after 3 years, I'll be looking at Canon and Epson, but not Kodak and not HP. Much as I like HP's paper, their ink is even more expensive than others.

My new life goal at this point is to have a printer break just as I've used up all the ink that I have for it. Since I'll have HP paper, THAT is the only thing I don't have to worry about.",5,11.765175

4710,"This is the best phone on the market. Better than Panasonic which I just gave away. The handset uses a better battery. The voice is crystal clear on every feature. Talking and listening on both handsets,the speakerphone,the recorded messages. All are perfect. It automatically sets the time and date. It came preset up. Call blocking is a snap and so is storing numbers. It lights up like a Christmas tree and that is helpful in the dark. Even the handset. Barely had to use the instruction booklet. The only flaw was the day of the week was off by 2 days when a message was recorded so I got a replacement unit. There are 2 models of this unit-the D3098 and the D3098S. The S model is black and silver. This is white. I purchased the S model also. The handset is supposed to stay charged for 10 hours talk time.  Replacement batteries and additional handsets are easily available. 99% of all products have good and bad reviews. The buttons are easy to read,light up and easy to press. You can adjust the volume for all aspects. The handsets are DCX309 and DCX309S. It also filtered out the static on the line that my last phone didn`t. The handset has a ton of features. This thing is high tech. The book says 7 days standby time. It also says 500mAh capacity. The battery says 400mAh. It wasn`t lasting 10 hrs. talk and 7 days standby so I put in an 700mAh. Most replacements were 750mAh. I` ll let you know how it works out. it also filters out noise better than other phones. I have used call block and works good. It works during power outages. The handset didn`t hold a charge long enough so bought a higher mAh battery. The batteries in the handset just won`t hold a charge for more than 2 days on standby but it`s not a deal breaker.

The ink is mixable and you can also dilute it with water. These are a unique design, all other pens have a split or channel on the middle upper side of the pen but these pens have a double layer nib that allows the ink to flow evenly between them from the entire width of the nib.

4716,"Large (well, it does do quite a lot), the HP 8610 is a very, very good printer.

Setting up is easy (OK, it could be painless and I am taking away a star for it because . . . the instructions provided do not tell you a bloody thing!  I had to go on-line to figure out just where the printer door was) and once set-up, it performs like a true professional printer.

The machine is quite noiseless and, unlike other HP printers, does not shake violently while it is printing.  The screen (which you need because the set-up instructions are displayed there and not in a provided manual) is exceptionally small.  Although I was never a fan of the screen, it was a nice additive whose welcome was soon worn out.  This was one case where the screen is a useful additive and there is little reason or rhyme as to why it is so tiny.

What could be smaller - a lot smaller - is the bulky 8210.  The top tray is a bit of a confusion.  The paper tray holds an overly generous amount of paper so why have a top feeder as well?  It takes up precious space and often confuses the printer when it tries to decide which tray to print from.  I could have lived nicely without that add-on.

It prints quickly, quietly and accurately.  I was overly pleased with the photo quality of the HP 8610 (the lack of PhotoSmart printers was a bit of a shock to me but, obviously, that secret was added to their Officejet Pro lines) and the quick set-up (less than a half hour) only made me glad that I stuck to HP for my home printer.",2,7.4163938

The Pen Botique was very helpful by replacing the Fine Nib that I mistakenly ordered with a Medium Nib. I do recommend this pen. The biggest problem I have with fountain pens is filling the inkwell. My parker Chiselled sonnet is a Pain in the Pen to fill. The only way I know it is filling is if I look at the inkwell clear part. You have to put it down into the ink bottle so that the very top of the Nib is in the ink. Then you have to wipe it with a kleenex so you do not get the ink on your hand. The Pelikan is much easier to fill without all of the fuss.,6,6.8497906

4722,"So, whenever you purchase ink for an inkjet printer, you have to ask yourself a couple of questions. Are you printing on quality photo paper to reproduce high-quality photos you have taken? Or are you printing out memos that were sent out to everyone in the company? Do you need a long-lasting print, or is it something that only needs a ""shelf life"" of a year?

For my inkjet printed at the office, I use an inexpensive, third-party brand for printing up occasional items that I need at the office. And it works fine (also a Canon printer). But when I am print A3+ 13""x19"" photos I took on professional Canon printer paper (either matte or one of the glossy types), there is no substitute for the real Canon ink. It IS hideously expensive. But it makes a difference. It is not dye sublimation printing, so you won't have a 15-year print here, but you'll get correct colors, smooth operation, and a print that will last a number of years before fading sets in. These inks are indeed overpriced, but there is also no substitute for them: they work great, they look great, they print the correct colors, they have a generally long life before fading, and so on. It's hard to recommend them at this price. But then again, it's hard NOT to recommend them if you want good prints, particularly if you are a semi-professional or enthusiast photographer.",12,10.716677

4724,"I was recently tasked with picking up some pencils for my son's 2nd grade classroom.  The teacher specifically mentioned these pencils as being ""the ones to get"" and cited ease of sharpening and lack of lead breakage.  So, I cruised over to Amazon and started reading reviews and was spooked by people saying that since they moved production to Mexico quality has gone downhill.  I decided to buy these in addition to some other more expensive options in case they were unusable.

Well, let me assure you: these pencils are fine.  They might have had a dip in quality at one point in time but it looks like they have figured it out.  I examined a few carefully to make sure that some of the complaints I read about (e.g. the paint being messed up, the ""2"" being illegible, etc.) were fixed and as far as I can tell they are.  These aren't as nice as some other premium pencils, but, for the price they are great for a classroom setting.

I have the matching wrist rest WR85B, so I thought I'd get this one.  The wrist wrest is OK.  This mouse pad is, however, garbage!

For starters, it is not even close to being flat.  It is warped/dished, and the corners raise off my desk 1/8"" to 1/4"".  So, as you move the mouse around, it is flopping around as well.  This is a deal breaker for me.  I tried to flatten it out with no improvement whatsoever.

Next, it is really too small.  Like the wrist wrest, the gel is quite hard, and, therefore, it's best to use it as a PALM rest.  Either way, it is too short.  From where your wrist wrests, the mouse goes off the top of the pad often.  Width-wise, it is OK.  Not generous, but OK.

Additionally, it is a very scratchy/rough material for the mouse surface.  It feels like you are almost dragging your mouse on sandpaper.  It does not move easily, and, considering I am using a very expensive/precious Logitech MX Revolution mouse, I don't want it wearing the pads off.

Finally, sort of a con, but these are not the ""satin pillow"" that 3M describes, but rather a firm (almost no give) gel/rubber with a matte soft-touch vinyl cover much like you might see on some automotive surfaces.

4736,"Having used Uniden cordless phones at my home, our last purchase of a home phone was back in 2002, so suffice to say, it was time for an upgrade and also to see how today's Uniden phones are in terms of technology and features.

Having seen the Uniden D3280-2 on sale for $29.99, I had to make the purchase, especially because of the special features that this phone comes with.

I.  WHAT'S IN THE BOX

You get two Uniden D320-2 Cordless phones, the base (with answering machine and another for the second phone but a smaller/rechargeable handset.  The external power cords and a two clip accessories.

II. WHY THIS PHONE?

- CellLink Technology - This Uniden D320-2 phone offers CellLink.  Having Bluetooth capability, after pairing the phone (up to 4 cell phones can be paired) via Bluetooth (set to Bluetooth, it will give you a code. Set your cell phone to Bluetooth and enter the code of the Uniden phone provided and you can easily pair the phones), you can then switch from the Uniden phone to your cell phone seamlessly.

There are buttons for regular use and a cell button to switch to your cell phone via Bluetooth.

Also, by pairing, you can easily download your phone numbers (up to 6,000 contacts, up to 1500 per cell phone) in your cell phone to the Uniden phone.  And downloading was fast and easy.

- Message Manager - You can easily browse through messages by caller name and you can easily block up to 20 phone numbers.

- Battery Life - Up to 7 hours.

- Expandable up to 12 handsets using one phone jack.

- 16 Minutes recording time with remote message retrieval.

- DECT 6.0, Mute button, intercom, compatible with Uniden DRX100 Range Extender, Tri-lingual (English, French and Spanish) menu screens and voice prompts, silent mode to turn of the ringer

But with all these features, the primary reason was price.  This phone does go down on sale and I bought it for $29.99, which to me, is fantastic!

JUDGMENT CALL:

What I love about this phone is how sleek it looks with its black, shiny sheen, thin handset and so far, the phone's battery has lasted long as advertised.  But also the CellLink technology which worked perfectly.  I like the fact that I can switch to the cordless and to the cell phone and that you can download phone numbers and contacts to this Uniden cordless phone.

The functions were easy for me to figure out and use, but I will say that for those who want something simple and not many functions, this phone MAY NOT be the one that you want.

For instance, my wife was using it and she saw four buttons but then the center portion has a circular wheel with five buttons.  She was trying to figure out how to get to the menu or to get call waiting.  As long as you can figure out what the four main buttons and the four center buttons are, it's easy.  But she was used to the four buttons that our previous phone had and felt it was too complicated for her (at first).

The four main buttons on the top of the phone (under the screen) are Home, Cell, speaker phone and end.  The inner buttons (in a circular pattern) are: UP & DOWN (for ringer volume), left for blue tooth, right button for Caller ID, center button is for menu.

The center button allows for Message Manager, Bluetooth, Handset Setup (T-coil, ringer tones which include 4 ringers and six melodies, personal ring, auto talk, any key answer, banner, key touch tone, LCD contrast and more), Answering Machine Setup, Date & Time, Global Setup, Call Blocking.

So, the Uniden D3280-2 does have a lot of features.  And would I recommend it?  Definitely, but just know that since this phone has gone down in price (on sale as low as $29.99), I wouldn't pay too much for it.  And if you can get it under $30 bucks, let alone under $40, it's definitely worth it!",3,14.57168

Pros:
1) Good Battery Life - after over 3 months of regular usage, the battery is still good. Easy to replace with spare battery in case it runs out.
2) Red LED for pointing at slides is clear - shows up clear no matter if the presentation uses a dark or light background. Very good strength and works well from 15 feet away.
4) Works for Apple and Windows - I sometimes have to present using different operating systems. This will work on both. Huge plus.
5) Works for powerpoint and Prezi. I use both interchangeably, and this works with PP And Prezi on both Apple and Windows. ++++
6) No software to download - Just plug in, wait a few seconds, then ready for use.
7) Intuitive Controls - Easy to use and understand.
8) Ergonomic - Have held for 1+ hour presentations. Comfortable to hold. Also light which is a plus.
9) Travel Friendly - Small and easy to transport. Comes with a nice Travel case. The part of the remote that you plug into the computer you are using fits into the remote, so everything is in one small convenient package.

Cons:
1) Would have preferred the ability to charge via USB rather than using batteries. However, the battery life is good so this isn't a huge con for me.
2)  Would like to have ability to play Videos on PowerPoint with this. It's not often, but sometimes I have videos embedded in my presentation.

I have used other remotes that connect through USB, but this one connects through Bluetooth. Connection was quick and simple with my Mac  I made sure that Bluetooth was on in my Bluetooth preferences, pressed the next/previous slide buttons for three seconds (blue LED will flash above the buttons) and looked for ST-APA and then clicked pair. Thats all there is to it.

The remote is 5.25 inches long and weighs 2.1 oz. The top part is black and rubberized and the lower aluminum part has the Satechi logo screen printed on the side. Its fits comfortably in your hand. You charge it by using the enclosed 8.5 inch long micro USB cable plugged into the bottom of the remote. A blue LED will illuminate to let you know it is charging and it will turn red when charged.. The power on/off (three second press) is located on the bottom also.

There is a laser pointer built into the remote. You press the button above the next slide to activate. It is strong and was very clear over the 30 feet distance in my test room. The next button and previous button are spaced nicely so you won't hit one by accident.

Its comes with a convenient carrying case for the remote and the charging cable. Its nice not having to worry about losing a USB dongle.

The only thing that is lacking from this remote and that will cost it a star (struggled with that decision) is the lack of cursor movement.  Many times a link will be embedded in a presentation or you would like to play a movie clip with play/pause ability. There is plenty of space on the remote to have added this functionality. If all your presentations do not need this feature, then no worries. But may times I do and miss this feature.

4750,"I've been interested in a small projector for both personal and business reasons. I am a Systems Engineer at a Systems Integration company and we often perform demos of our software for customers during the sales process. Having a small portable projector is ideal for those times when I accompany a salesperson to a customer's office to perform these demos.

At home, I wanted a projector to more comfortably view movies and shows streamed to my PC via HBO Go, Amazon Prime Streaming, etc. While I can view it on my laptop, having these videos play on a larger screen is much nicer.

The 3M MP300 Mobile Projector is definitely compact - I could even fit it in my purse if I wanted to. Most people would be able to fit this in their briefcase, unless that briefcase is already bulging at the seams.

It is also refreshingly easy to connect and set up. The projector comes with a standard HDMI cable, which I connected to the HDMI port on my laptop, then turned the projector on. Voila! The projector immediately mirrored my laptop's display and adjusted the resolution to one ideal for the projector. Disconnecting the projector from the PC automatically returns the computer's resolution to your normal setting.

I was also able to change the display to use an extended desktop view rather than mirroring my desktop so that I could show something different on the projector than I displayed on the laptop's monitor. This is a great configuration for demonstrations so that you can show slides or a product on the screen while checking or taking notes on the laptop.

3M makes a tabletop screen they recommend for this projector, but I opted for a screen with a tripod instead,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/FAVI-16-9-72-Inch-Portable-Tripod-Projector-Screen-TRI-HD-72/dp/B004A7Z1RG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">FAVI 16:9/72-Inch Portable Tripod Projector Screen (TRI-HD-72)</a>. I wanted a screen I could place anywhere - even the patio - without need for a table. The MP300 works very well with this screen and takes advantage of the wide screen aspect. The further back you move the projector, the larger the picture on the screen is.

The projector also plays sound through its internal speaker. However, the sound may not be loud enough for some meeting rooms. To accommodate this, 3M has built this projector with an audio out port so you can attach some better external speakers if you wish.

The projector has a rechargeable battery, so you can use it without external power for a few hours - long enough to watch a movie or give most demos. Should you have a need for longer use, you can use the power adapter that is included in the package to keep it powered on. The same adapter is used to charge the battery.

I am very pleased with the 3M MP300 projector. Interested buyers should be aware that this projector only works with HDMI ports, so you should check your device to make sure you can connect to it.",19,9.303525

I reduced the margins, which helps, but only on one side  it leaves a mark to indicate where you have to manually trim the other side, which still leaves you with some wasted tape.

4765,"I researched for this in Amazon last month, and took some time to think about if this was the route I wanted to go for a small LCD Monitor mount.  I opted to purchase it and I could not be more pleased with it.

Easy to mount to the wall, very well designed, and allows free articulation and positioning of the LCD with easy and precision.  I am using it as a swing-out and position perpendicular to a side wall to where I sit and it works great.

The only thing to keep in mind with this wall mount is that it will not allow you to position the Monitor downward more then about 7 inches from the horizontal arm.  Not a concern in my case, and probably not for most cases, but be aware as if you intend to mount it high and want to bring it down.. that won't work as it's not designed for that.  So plan for ~ eye level positioning of the LCD panel relative to the mount point of the arm to the wall and you will be fine.

The manual (actually a large fold out double sided sheet) is the usual confusing multi-language instruction sheet.  Once I highlighted the English sections it was easy to use.  I recommend you spend a little time familiarizing yourself with all the tension adjustments before you mount it.. that way.. you are ready and know where to adjust as you install and attach an LCD panel.  I put a 22 in 16:9 7lb panel on it and it worked great. Final tension adjustments about 10-15% up from minimum settings.",2,7.119141
4766,"My previous employer, in its 'ergonomic' phase, bought this chair for all of the cubicles and offices.  I have to agree with the person that rated this lower than all the fives. The 'right' office chair is so subjective.  If you do not have the right thigh length, the chair seems to do more damage than good because it hits the back of the leg so that it hurts over time.  I tried the chair in all three of the '3 bear' sizes and never found one that was just right for sitting at my desk. The parts of the chair are not bad; its the combination of parts that just doesn't quite work. The chair is highly unforgiving other than the lumbar pad, if you can get it positioned in the lumbar area. The seat is webbed and rigid, so I added a cervical pillow so my legs would not go to sleep. I also couldn't stand the - er ventilation of the webbing which felt most of the time like I was sitting in a lawn chair. It is not highly adjustable, in fact, I never did figure out all of the levers; not because I couldn't find them, but because they were so hard to twist, lift and pull to adjust the chair. Two years after these were purchased, most of the chairs still had the adjustment instruction booklets hanging from the chairs. I would compare this to a no-frills model car that has the twist knobs to adjust the driver's seat instead of the nice buttons that zoom the seat up and down and back and tilt the legs, etc.  Some people did like these chairs, but I do strongly suggest that you 'test drive' it like you would a car and spend a little time sitting in it.  There are other ergonomically correct chairs out there, in leather and faux leather, with a cushy seat for the tushy that are by far more comfortable, and just as pricey.  My trade-off was finding an older, basic desk chair that worked just as well.  Wish I had an alternative to offer.  I just wouldn't buy this on-line.",13,7.712118

The user interface is tweaked a bit, and you can now have a bigger phonebook (3000) and a bigger block list (250), but it's otherwise very similar.

The ""link2cell"" feature is a complete disappointment for me, because my phone, and many of the newer phones, aren't supported.  Samsung S4 and later?  Nope.  And we all use Samsung phones in my family.  Ok, how about LG?  None of the later models.  iphone7?  Still no.  So if you really care, find the compatible phone list (do a web search, it's not easy to find on the Panasonic site).

The first time that I used these Sharpie markers, I knew that I'd found the only brand that I would use in the future.

Frankly, although the marker has two tips, the broader one is similar to the Maxell markers that I already didn't much care for.  But the other end, the finer tip, is exquisite, perfect for labeling discs.  Honestly, I don't even know why markers for CD/DVDs is made with the broader tips.

Sharpie makes these markers in a variety of tips, but I recommend basic black.  I take a pretty utilitarian approach to all this.  I want it to work.  And for most purposes the black works best.  And for all purposes, the narrower tip works best.  If Sharpie ever brings this same marker out with only the narrow tip, I'll switch to that.",2,5.578022

4775,"EDITED 8/3/16:  Stander Customer Service shipped me a replacement STANDER OMNI TRAY that arrived about 3 days after our telephone conversation.  After inspecting the replacement, I decided to reassemble my original tray to see whether it was in fact defective.  As it turns out, it was NOT defective--after an application of Liquid Wrench (penetrating oil) on top of the previously applied WD-40, the swivel in the tray support arm finally broke loose.  It was very stiff at first, and actually groaned when moved, but it does swivel 360 degrees (and it's loosening up and quieter now).

My disabled husband likes this STANDER OMNI TRAY.  He finds that the knob atop the tray support does help him in standing up (when it's positioned in the right place, which is easy to do during initial setup).  He is also able to swivel the tray out of the way, even though the swivel is still stiff.

The tray is almost, but not quite, usable as a free-standing tray.  When the tray is swiveled forward to hold plates or a laptop, the whole stand tilts forward unless the supporting feet are weighted down.  My husband's TV chair isn't an upholstered easy chair, so the legs are not far enough apart (at only 18.5"" on the side) to do the job.  However, a hospital-style overbed table that stands next to his chair works fine to hold the tray and stand in place.  Alternatively, one could use free weights or other kinds of heavy objects to weight down the stand's feet.  The stand does NOT tilt when someone leans on the knob to stand up, because the support for the knob directly contacts the floor--so that's NOT a safety concern.

Because the STANDER OMNI TRAY customer service is terrific, and because my only complaints now are that (1) the swivel was too hard to break free, and (2) the tray isn't a free-standing device, I've upgraded my star rating for the second time, this time to 4 stars (""I like it"" on the official Amazon scale).  (I returned the replacement Omni tray to the manufacturer, at their expense.)

EDITED 7/11/16:  Stander Customer Service was extremely quick to respond to my problem with the non-pivoting tray, was pleasant to deal with, and is shipping me a replacement STANDER OMNI TRAY.  Pending receipt and testing of the replacement product, I'm revising this review to 3 stars (""It's okay"" on the official Amazon scale).  My original stand has a defective ""the swivelTray Support Assembly"".  Other reviewers have mentioned that the pivot is tight at first, but mine won't move at all.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
What a disappointment!  This is the first Stander product that I haven't liked, but either my STANDER OMNI TRAY has a defective swivel arm, or the product does NOT work as advertised.  After I assembled the product, I discovered that the tray arm does NOT pivot/swivel out of the way as shown in the product page photos, or as suggested by the blue arrow beneath the tray in the product box photos.

If the tray can't be swung out of the way, the product is useless for an elderly or handicapped person like my stroke-disabled husband.  If a person has difficulty standing up--and would find the ""ergonomic mobility handle"" useful--then the person cannot wiggle around a tray that's permanently positioned directly in front of them.

I tried everything to loosen the tray support arm so that it would swivel.  I wrenched it sideways (no luck), then took the stand apart so I could put my whole weight on it to loosen it (no luck).  Banging it on my garage floor didn't work, either.  Nor did it help to spray the pivot area with WD-40.  This fairly expensive stand (about $165 on Amazon) is manufactured of good quality materials, but the quality control on the parts is evidently not what it ought to be. (My stand arrived in a box that was undamaged, with all of the shaped inner styrofoam packing completely intact.)

As for the assembly, I found the instructions hard to follow.  It would help a lot to have enlarged drawings of the various types of bolts and screws, to make it easy to identify the ""set screws"" and the ""long"" and ""square neck"" bolts.  The stand parts go together in only one way, so you can't really make a mistake.  However, I had to work at understanding the assembly instructions, despite having lots and lots of experience with assembling furniture, and with using Allen wrenches and little flat open wrenches.

My final complaint is that the stand is designed to be held down by the legs of a heavy chair or couch.  This makes sense, if a person wants to lean on the stand for extra support in standing up.  However, if I'd understood this from the ad, I wouldn't have ordered the product, because I don't have a suitable piece of furniture located in the area where I need the tray.

Because the tray on the product that I received does NOT pivot to one side (although the tray itself rotates 360 degrees), indicating very poor quality control, I rate this STANDER OMNI TRAY at 1 star (""I hate it"" on the official Amazon scale).",2,14.025773

4783,"This is my fourth Filofax. I've had an A5 Finsbury (too large for my daily use and hated how the leather was so quick to wear at the corners and snap), a personal Malden (too floppy, the zipper got in the way, and the pen loop wouldn't stretch to fit anything but the slimmest of pens), a personal Saffiano (gave it a great review and loved the setup but just couldn't get over the artificial feel of it in my hands), and now this Original, which might finally be my goldilocks planner.

First the good: nice heavy leather, good stitching in a demure but still fashionable contrast stitch, vintage looking Filofax snap button, streamlined on the inside with little to distract from function...no buttons, not a ton of pockets, etc...The colors in this line are also much more appealing. I did like the Malden leather as it showed grain, but my purple Malden was so dark it looked black, and my two other choices were a brown and a black. The original comes in almost as many colors as their Saffiano non-leather line, and the colors are bright and rich.

Now to the not-so-good: the closure strap is riveted and not stitched on. There's been a few times when I've tried opening it from the rivet instead of the actual snap. LoL. No big thing. However, it's also too short. I compared it to my Saffiano, and it's a considerable amount shorter, which gives less room for stuffing or, in this case, less room for my pen. It has an elasticized pen loop (love), but I never get to use it because when I pull the strap over, the pen gets crammed between the pages. It's sewn too low so that, unlike the Saffiano, the pen doesn't easily go over the dividers but actually tends to be below insert level. If you do pull hard enough to squeeze the pen and loop upwards and over the dividers, it crushes the tabs. So I basically don't use it at all.

This multi-function printer (or all-in-one) is an excellent value; the fact that it has an automatic document feeder is just icing on the cake. Setup could NOT be simpler; HP could learn a huge lesson on software included with printers, as Epson's software doesn't take over your computer, is fairly unobtrusive and is so easy to install.

As to print, documents print crisply, not like some Lexmarks that do a great job with photos but their document print leaves much to be desired.  This Epson prints documents and photos excellently.  If you'll spring for Epson's 'Ultra Premium' photo paper you'll be pleasantly surprised.  Compared to my older HP 3310, photos are almost twice as good in every respect.  One niceity is the color saturation; I don't think anyone approaches the deep colors of Epson, when combined with their quality paper.

I really only have two items that prevent me from giving a solid 5 star rating.  First, the lack of wireless; that would just make this printer so much more convenient.  Second, the printer is quite an ink hog; I was amazed at how quickly it will drain the color tanks; quite the opposite on my older HP...it lasted far longer between tank changes and the black ran down equally with the colors.

LINE QUALITY/FLOW - I give this ink 5 stars for flow and line quality ... it literally made a perfect line the first time the nib touched the paper ... NO skip at all, not even on the first stroke.  It continues to lay down really nice, consistent, smooth lines.

COLOR/HUE - (personal preference) The shade of purple ink is very pleasing to my eye.  I'm not sure what international standard color system you use, so I can't give you an absolute reference, but I'd describe it as a strong, ""very slightly to the red"" side of purple ... it's definitely NOT a blueish purple (not the color of the petals on a violet flower) but neither is so red as to be called a magenta. Perhaps a mulberry?  Whether or not you will like it depends on your preferences, but I do like it. See attached photo sample. I should note that I feel the color compliments the hue of the Al-Star purple Lamy pen body.

DRYING QUALITIES - the ink dries fast enough that I haven't had it smear on me yet in 2 days of heavy writing.  I should note that the hue/tone change slightly as the ink dries. It starts off a bit lighter tone and slightly redder hue and dries to the darker/bluer, ending up in a medium mulberry (see photo).

TRANSLUCENT/OPAQUE - I'd describe this as a medium opaque ink. Some inks, when you look at droplets of them on a bright surface, you can't see any trace of light reflecting back through the ink droplet ... completely opaque. This ink allows some light reflection back through the ink. So if you want a seriously opaque purple ink, this might not work for you.  I would NOT describe this as a watery, or ""thin"" or overly transparent ink.  It puts down a line I like very much.

I will update this review in the future if any new properties of this ink come to light.",26,12.15046

4793,"I got this notebook becouse I loved the cover. It's much better built than the composition books at Walmart, but be forewarned, the paper is very absorbent. In fact, it's almost become my standard of bad paper, if it doesn't bleed through this paper it won't bleed through 99% of any other kind of paper. Even regulair bick pens bleed through.  Another disappointment is that it's made in Taiwan, while the cheapo 3 dollar one is made in the US.

4801,"A very good small footprint moveable black-and-white laser printer.  It is a fast 2-sided printer and best suited for home or small business use.  It does only printing...no fax, no copy, no scan.  You can connect via USB cable, ethernet cable or wirelessly.  I tested it using wireless connections only and had a few problems getting it set up which I'll discuss later.

It comes with two toner cartridges and one drum unit.  One of the toner cartridges was already installed in the drum unit but I had to find this out on page 197 of the owners manual.  Brother has a few different capacity toner cartridges but I think each toner cartridge provided is good for about 4500 pagers.  The drum unit is good for about 12,000 pages.  Brother says you can get up to two years use without purchasing a new cartridge.  Based on my projected use that may be accurate.  If so, it blows away all business ink jets and many laser printers.

SETUP:
-  A simple set up sheet and setup CD is provided.  I chose to download all drivers and software directly from Brother's website to get the latest drivers and software.  I also downloaded the Owners Manual.  This process was easy.  Owners Manual is the most complete and detailed I've seen.  Great for small businesses who have a variety or requirements.

-  Using the setup sheet I could not get the printer to connect to my home wireless network.  My network would not recognize the printer.  I had to connect a USB cable to the printer and computer to establish initial wireless connectivity.  This worked perfectly.  I disconnected the USB cable and moved the printer across the room.  No problems connecting after this.

-  Initially I kept getting a paper jam indication and paper wouldn't feed.  I checked the owners manual and thought I was loading the paper tray correctly.  Paper is high quality 24lb Laser Quality Hammerhill.  After trial and error I determined paper must be pushed all the way to the rear of the paper tray and the front paper slide pushed as far to the back of the tray against the paper as it can go.  That's unlike any paper tray I've used where paper is pushed against the front of tray.  The Owners Manual doesn't mention this.  Once properly loaded paper feeds normally with no problems.  There are extensive setup options for paper types, print quality, and numerous other settings.  This is a business oriented printer and settings reflect a wide variety of options.

USE:
-  Print speed is very good.  While I didn't measure actual speeds I'd estimate I can print out 16+ pages a minute.

-  Print quality is exceptional and up to laser printer standards.  I had no problem printing from Microsoft Word or using Brother's iPrint/Scan standalone software.  Mobile print options are extensive and work well.  I used Apple's Airprint with excellent results, however you can mobile print using Google Cloud Print, Mobile Printing for Windows, Mopria Print Service, and Brother iPrint&Scan.  There may be others but that's what Brother advertises.

-  Noisy motor and printing process.  Quiet when not printing.  Probably not noticeable in an office but very noticeable at home.  This can be reduced by using the ECO mode which I switched on.  This reduced the noise level without much loss of printer speed and no apparent loss of print quality.

-  Manual feed slot for envelopes and heavy card stock.  Use this feed slot by opening up front and back panel doors.  Only one envelope or card stock can be fed at a time.  Worked fine for business size envelopes but limited to feeding one at a time.

SUMMARY:  While I have yet to put this printer to serious office use, I am initially impressed.  It has a small footprint and while not small enough to be called mobile it's certainly very moveable around the house or office.  Long life print cartridges also appeal.  I'm using an Epson Work Force 4640 multi-function ink jet printer and I'm changing ink cartridges often which is eating into my profits.  I don't do much color printing so I may use the Epson only when I need color and use the Brother for B&W printing.  If you need a high quality B&W laser printer without fax/scan/copy functions this printer deserves serious consideration.  I'd give it five stars except that setup was a bit rocky.",3,8.937843

4804,"The Sharpie Pro Magnum is definitely the B.M.O.C. (Big Man On Campus) in the Sharpie family.

If you need large areas covered in quick drying black ink, this is your marker.  The chisel tip is 9/16"" wide and 1/4"" narrow.  This marker has some serious surface area and can cover some ground.  I will be using this marker for large area processing when it comes to blacking out labels or marking larger coolers with my companies name as this marker is meant for big jobs.  If you want to make a lasting impression this is the marker you use to do that.  I can see this marker being used to make labeling moving boxes a quick and easy job.  I could also see this used for making large marks on poster board for displays.  I know a lot of people will use this for blacking out shipping labels either for reusing boxes or for privacy and I would definitely recommend this marker for those jobs.  I could also see using this to black out sensitive information on mail, documents and reports so that you don't have to shred that material.

I did find that marking items that were wet was not the same experience as marking them dry but it can be done.  Results will vary between different levels of wetness and the material in which you want to write on.  If you are looking for something not as big and bold I would recommend the King Size as the standard, everyday marker you want.  I do like that the Sharpie Pro Magnum body is made of aluminum which gives a great look and increased durability over plastic.  I do like that you can stand the Magnum on its end as the bottom of the marker is flat.  This is a really nice specialized Sharpie marker.

I would recommend the Sharpie Pro Magnum to anyone who needs a large marker for blacking out large amounts of sensitive information or someone who needs a big marker to make big marks on boxes, materials, walls and anything else you need fewer passes to cover it all in ink.

I am not a picture-quality expert, so no complaints in that area. Also, the features that I like are the Z-Lid and the USB connection (no additional power plug required). However, the software is so-so for both models. Confusing to navigate between screens, in my opinion. The software that comes with the 210 model offers no improvement over the older version, at least from what I can see. Also, the 210 model comes in black, which I don't like (but others may dig).

If you are using Windows 7 and are choosing between 200 or 210, I would suggest just getting the newer model, even though you have to pay a few bucks more.

4812,"I have three inexpensive clear-barrel, fine-point nib demonstrator fountain pens: a Lamy Safari Vista, an eyedropper Noodler's fountain/ballpoint tip combo (it came with the Hearts of Darkness bottle of ink) and this Nemosine Singularity.

The Lamy nib writes the smoothest of the three but this Nemosine still writes fine, does not leak and has good ink flow when using the black ink cartridges that came with the pen. The ink in the cartridges is very black and dries quickly. I haven't tested the converter yet. I also prefer the round barrel of this pen over the Lamy grip that has edges.

Not sure how durable the clear plastic barrel and cap will be since it seems lighter in weight than the Lamy. This definitely is better made than the Noodler's eyedropper pen (the cap for that pen cracked within the first day of use and the writing tips leak or clog).

- One of the binders was completely TORN at both seams exposing the inner cardboard.
- The other binder had a large defect with a huge ripple in the back inside cover making it impossible to insert papers into the pockets and causing damage to anything inserted into the binder (as it would have to rest on the large ripple if the binder was lying flat on a table).

4827,"This review is intended to augment the review written by ""Citizen John"".  IMO, all the info in John's review was right on.  I think he missed some points.

A little intro.  I recently bought an Aeron, highly adjustable, size C.  I like it.  So far, I think it is worth the (considerable amount of...) money.  I hope it will last.  I wish somebody had told me how to get to my current state (sitting in my Aeron) with a little less hand-wringing.

1.  Authorized dealers.  There is a whole thing about counterfeit chairs, used chairs, chairs without the ""born-on"" sticker.  If you go to the Herman Miller website, they list *every* authorized dealer.  I bought from one of these outfits, and got a new chair with a sticker and registered it with HM with no problems.

2,  ""Pellicle"" design.  The bottom line is that this chair is unconventional.  The heart of the chair consists of a frame, over which is stretched a thin membrane or ""pellicle"".  If you like your chairs soft, forget this one right away.  The pellicle needs to be stretched really taut to work out.  The fabric they use is an open weave.  They tout that this makes the chair cool in summer.  I believe it.  It also makes the chair cool in winter.  I never realized before that my butt stays warm sitting on a conventional chair.

3.  Choices.  There are a large number of choices to be made.  Type of fabric (different weaves).  Color of fabric.  Frame material (faux-carbon or chrome).  Ability to tilt forward and lock, and to tilt back and lock (together called ""highly adjustable"".)  Size (A, B, C).  According to the HM website, my size could work with either B or C.  I have a C and I know that for me a B would have been a mistake.  Choice of no arms, arms, or adjustable arms.  Option of leather material for arms.  Lumbar support (for lower back).  Posture fit (for upper back).  Rollers designed for carpet, or rollers designed for hardwood, or no rollers for the feet.  None of this is rocket science, but there are a lot of things to decide.

After I've been sitting in the chair for an hour or so, the feeling imparted to my butt and my back from the ""pellicle"" suspension is totally different from the feeling I have gotten from sitting in any other chair.  If I had it to do again, I'd try real hard to have a 1 hour sit in the chair before buying.  It is not that there's anything wrong about sitting on a ""pellicle"", it is just that it is different, and when I'm forking over this much money for something, I want to have confidence that I'm going to like it.

Again, I like my chair.  I hope this review will take a little of the unnecessary anxiety out of buying an Aeron.",12,14.630145
4828,"We bought this printer to replace our old workhorse, the HP2600.  We were excited because this is an LED printer, and we thought it would add to the longevity of the product.

I found the product easy to set up and the driver installation straightforward.  The actual menu navigation on the printer is slightly confusing, but not unmanageable.  Once you get those things set up, the printer is ready to go.

The plain text printing off of this printer is actually quite good.  I printed a ten page academic paper, and the text was crisp and clean.  However, the image print quality off of this printer is ABYSMAL.  Any photo we printed was streaked with fine, black diagonal lines, rendering the image visible but pretty dang ugly.  We calibrated and fussed with the printer, but it was quickly obvious that the machine was technically fine.

If all you print is text, this printer should work for you.  However, at that point, you might as well invest in a monochrome laser printer.

4833,"I've had a love affair with these pens since first buying them at Target a few months ago.

They write smoothly, the shape is comfortable in my hand, and the tip is perfectly sized. I use them to write in my moleskine notebook, and there's no bleed through or smudging.

Even better, they fit perfectly in the Leuchtturm Pen Loop I have on my moleskine.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leuchtturm-Black-Pen-Loop/dp/B002RNRYN4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leuchtturm Black Pen Loop</a>

The only con is they eventually do dry out, and become difficult to write with. If I'm using 1 pen constantly for all my daily writing, it'll usually crust up in 3-4 weeks. For the price, that's a perfectly acceptable burn through rate to me.",10,4.9519444

4836,"Likes:
 sticky adhesive stays closed
 security pattern
 full-size envelope
 dual flap design
Dislikes:
 you have to make sure that you press the adhesive closed firmly otherwise it can open back up
 depending on the type of mail that you are sending sometimes it can be a little challenging to fit it in the envelope because of the dual flaps instead of just an open top

Overall:
when I was shopping around for envelopes I needed something that was full-size and self-adhesive. I guess the better word is self-sealing. My needs were met with the Colombian number 10 self seal security tinted envelopes. Some people have complained that the adhesive doesn't hold, and thats very possible if you don't press firmly enough. I've even tried stuffing these envelopes full and the adhesive still is able to hold. As far as how transparent the envelopes are You really cant see through these. I tried holding them up to the light when I had a check inside and I wasn't able to see anything. Like I noted above, sometimes it can be challenging to fit certain types of mail into the envelope because of the dual flap design. So when you're considering buying these envelopes, think about the type of mail you're going to be sending and if it will be a problem not having a top opening envelope.

4837,"When it arrived it was seamless. I've had trouble with printing wirelessly with my Canon printer, and this one had rave reviews. Well, I raved about it until I had to replace ink. This one I got for mom, so we will just replace the first ink cartridge this week. We needed something what would work well with the iPads and and mom's macbook air.

I always replace ink cartridges with Epson ink. I learned long ago that anything else would mess up your printer, hopelessly. Well, now it seems that Epson's ink messes it up. I replaced first one cartridge then another in mine, then it started printing horribly. I checked the nozzles and they all needed to be cleaned. Repeated cleaning resulted in worsening printing. Then about the 5th cleaning it suddenly wouldn't recognize a brand new cartridge that had been in for about a week. so I contacted Epson. They said it was a hardware problem and they would send a new printer. OK that was good.

New printer arrived, put in ink cartridges that they sent. Guess what same problem, lousy printing (my daughter apparently printed some items and they printed ok but not the quality expected. Ran a nozzle check. black nozzle not printing at all. did a cleaning, checked again, cleaned again you get the picture. Suddenly printer says that it cannot recognize a brand new cartridge that epson sent with the printer. Called Epson. They insist on sending out another print cartridge, for which I have to wait almost a week. Cartridge arrives, install cartridge, now the stupid thing won't recognize the other color cartridges. I'm terrified of changing cartridges in mom's printer because it seems as soon you change the ink cartridge the printer is toast. Mom's printer is past it's first year because she doesn't use it as frequently as we use ours. Who knows if Epson will even honor the warranty if the thing breaks.

Save yourself the grief, buy Canon. YOu might have trouble with wireless printing, but at least I've never had trouble with it knowing the ink cartridges are in. Epson get a clue!!!",4,9.515142

4839,"The Kantek Monitor Stand is one of the better ones you can purchase.  It is sleek, attractive, and holds Monitors, or laptops, perfectly.  There's no wobbling or bending down of the elevated area whatsoever. The surface area is large enough, both width and length, to support a variety of monitor bases.  Whether smaller LCD ones, wide screen or CRT bases, and even kickstand monitors, which the base is basically the bottom fo the screen.  The feet are made of heavy duty rubber.  Strong enough to hold anything up but will not scratch the surface of your desk (tested on tempered glass desk).  Even the label is possitioned and sized perfectly.  It doesn't ""scream"" who the manufacturer is and actually adds ""class"" to it. There is even a label underneath to ensure you that it's safe to use and does not release ""Spooky"" fumes.

Now, notice that huge But in the title? Hopefully you did because this is where the stand comes short.  It only elevates it by a total of 2 and one fourth of an inch.  That's it.  So it offers just enough room to place a non-gaming keyboard, smaller laptop, or DVD/Blu-ray player underneath.  Even low profile speakers will not fit, obviously. The surface adds an extra inch to it so overall it will elevate it around the three inch mark(a tad bit more).

If you're looking for a monitor stand that holds up, doesn't elevate it too high, and doesn't scream cheapness then would highly recommend it.  If not, might want to look around.",44,10.468069

The black pen is so smooth and the line it produces is very clean... I'm a old scientist and keep extensive notebooks, filled with equations, drawings and stuff. Over the years this pen has replaced all others. The purple pen is almost as smooth as the black one, and provides a very nice contrasting color. I use almost exclusively Cambrige beige papered notebooks and the ink does not bleed through the paper so both sides of the sheet can be used. The ink refill is of a large diameter and when I run one dry it is a moment to reflect on all the work we have done together. I used to use fountain pens to get a smooth ride on the paper from sterling silver barreled parkers to Water..? forget the name...

4856,"I am a long time user of Sharpie Poster Paints - and I continue to love and adore them as much as I did the very first time I picked one up. Paint pens are tricky - even pens made at the very same time don't necessarily act alike. Some remain dry, nasty nibs, no matter how many times you depress the nib. Some spread an enormous pool of ink/paint with the smallest nib bump - it doesn't even require the nib to be pressed in order to get the project-ruining flood of paint or ink to instantaneously appear. Some nibs are constantly clogged and either won't work, or leave little poop balls all over the place. And occasionally you are blessed by the Pen Gods (who are very fickle!) and receive a smooth-writing pen with amazing ink flow. I don't know why there can be such a variety of problems within the same brand - even the same line - of paint pens, but it's the way of the beast. Those who use paint pens on a consistent basis just accept this as the way things go...which really stinks.

The Sharpie Poster Paint Marker is above average in every area that makes us love paint pens. Yes, I've experienced all of the issues I've mentioned with the Sharpie brand, but the percentage of unusable pens has been very, very low. Especially in comparison to other brands. Since Sharpie puts out such an excellent marker, it would reason their paint pens would be good, too. However, I use several other brands of markers that are simply excellent - but their paint pen lines are just horrible. Definitely something I dread buying, hate using, and wouldn't recommend to anyone. I'm glad to say that, for whatever reason, Sharpie is different than those other brands - and puts out a paint pen I can recommend.

One little point I would like to clear up though, is about the ink. I know there is confusion about whether these pens (or markers) contain oil-, or water-based ink. The answer is both. The old Sharpie Poster Paint Markers used to be made with oil-based ink (or paint) - and they were AWESOME. Every creative person I know agrees on that. The oil-based markers would write on absolutely anything - the ink was fantastic and would last forever. The only issue with that ink was if you made a mistake - you couldn't just get rid of it. Chemicals were required to clean up accidents - and I will admit to ruining many projects because I wasn't able to completely remove mistakes I had made. That didn't make the paint markers bad - quite the opposite. I enjoyed using those and always knew I could count on them. Several years ago, Sharpie was going to discontinue the line of paint pens - to the dismay of artists everywhere. I'm not familiar with any details, but I know that Sharpie re-released the paint pens, but this time with water-based ink. My guess is the consumer tilt toward more eco-friendly, non-toxic products caused Sharpie to re-examine their formulation, which is too bad. I miss the old oil-based ink, but realize water-based is ""better"" for people and the environment. It just bums me out that I can't find the good ol' markers anymore. (You could make a sign with the oil-based markers and hang it outside...it didn't matter if it rained, sleeted, or snowed, nothing was going to hurt the marks you had made. That is totally not the case with the water-based formulation.)

I love these paint pens and can't imagine not having them available - I use them almost daily. They are the first paint pens I reach for. I own waaay too many of them, but I couldn't get rid of any. That isn't the case with other paint markers I have. As long as you are aware of the possible caveats of paint markers, I believe you will find these to be excellent addition to your pen repertoire. I love all the tip sizes: extra fine, fine, medium, and extra bold...but extra fine is my favorite. I hope these work as well for you!",130,11.37018
4857,"Compared with my old cheap shredder that finally died, I purchased this one and spent more than I expected to, based on the mostly excellent reviews here.  I can live with it, but I'm not thrilled with it, for the following reasons:

1.  It's SLOW!  I thought this was going to be great for shredding stacks of old documents I no longer need, but it would take so long with this shredder that I'll probably have to use a professional service.

2.  Unlike the videos of this model on the manufacturer's website, that show someone just dropping in a document as they walk by, this shredder does not ""grab"" the paper and send it on its way.  Instead, you have to push the paper down into the shredder before it takes it and slowwwly feeds it through.  This really slows things down.  My cheap old shredder (which is no longer made) grabbed the document immediately; it was really fast.

3.  The drawer that holds the paper shreds is really clunky to pull in and out.  It doesn't have any rails to ride smoothly like a real drawer.  Instead, you have to jostle it in and out, and sometimes it takes a fair amount of jostling to get it back in place.  The drawer also doesn't have any way to secure a plastic bag to hold the shreds.  The drawer isn't designed like a waste bin, where you can just pull the edges of a plastic bag over the edges of the bin.  Instead, one end of the drawer is also the exterior handle used to pull it out.

4.  It doesn't take nearly as much paper as I was expecting it to.  It has a row of lights that indicate whether you putting in too much paper for it to handle.  It doesn't take much for it to indicate that it's too much.  Around five to six sheets is the very most it can handle before protesting.

5.  Yes, like others, I did have to call the manufacturer to find out that the castors have to be hammered into place.  You'd think they could mention that in the instructions.  And they're not all that easy to hammer, given that they're spinning around madly while you're hammering them.

In all, having used it for a couple of weeks and having already discarded the packaging, I guess I'm stuck with it.  But I wouldn't buy it again.",3,10.703415

Sadly, this is one of the wide format printers that cannot print onto 12x12 and do so without borders (so that it prints the pattern to the edges of the paper).  I am so totally bummed out from this.  I had no idea that only certain pre-set photographic paper sizes can be printed without borders.  Now I know, $150 too late.  Other than that, this printer is absolutely beautiful.  I love Canon printers and have a smaller format ink jet that I've had for more than 2 years, maybe longer and it still works like a top.  Also, the other thing I would have paid more for is wireless.  My small format is wireless and it makes connecting for all of our homes computers a snap.

For example, it has the two lines to show you where the staple will go, auto or manual mode, staple storage, depth gage of how deep into the stack of paper you want to staple, quiet operation, cinch stapling, stack depth gauge to prevent you from trying too many sheets at once, low staple indicator, stylish and functional.

Some of the items I had concerns is the bottom staple storage tray sticks when you push to open, and end up just pulling it open, ability to unplug cord from back of unit making power supply outside of the unit.  When the unit is powered on the front red light stays on which is a little annoying-- I just unplug it.  Not a super fast stapler--takes a couple seconds to staple so not good if you have a lot to do--good for the average stapling job of a few stacks here and there.  However, the trade off on speed is noise-- the high speed ones sound like a gun going off.

4870,"The Canon Pixma MX922 printer is truly one of the best values for the money. I bought this printer for around $70 I would have a very hard time finding another printer just as good for under $150. Below I will go over the different aspects of the printer as well as the pros and cons.

Build Quality - The MX922 is a beast of a printer measuring in at 19.4 in wide, 15.6 in deep, and 9.1 in high and weighing 25.7 lbs. This definitely is not a compact printer by any means. The printer is made out of plastic all around, but for the insanely low price I can't complain.

Display Interface - The Canon printing interface is very well designed and is well suited for the 3 in color display. The menus are easy to navigate as well as feature packed with options such as template print which allows you to print your own notebook paper or graph paper without having to go to the store. My only complaint about the user interface is that typing  things such as the Wi-FI password is painfully slow.

Ease of Use - The Canon Mx922 is very easy to use either wirelessly or connected to your computer via a cable. The printer features two paper trays, one for photo paper and one for printer paper, a feature that is usually found on commercial printers. The main paper tray holds up to 250 sheets of paper which eliminates the need to refill paper every week. Another great feature of the MX922 is the automatic double sided printing. This is one of my favorite features of the MX922 since you don't have to manually flip the paper. The printer does that all on its own. The scanner also has automatic double sided scanning and scans both sides of the paper without you having to.

Ink Usage - This is one of the printers biggest flaws. The MX922 goes through its ink cartridges very quickly. However, unlike other printers, the Canon will print a black and white document even if the colored ink cartridges are depleted. One good thing about the ink is that you can buy XXL pigment black ink cartridges so that you can print many black and white documents using the pigment black ink.

Print Quality - The print quality of the MX922 is incredible. The printer can print at resolutions of up to 9600x2400 DPI for color and 600x600 DPI for black and white documents. Printing photos on photo paper yields incredible results. Pictures are sharp and colors are vivid, even when printing on regular photo paper. Photos look amazing, almost to the point where they look professionally printed. Because of the Canon, I now make personalized holiday cards on Microsoft Word and print them with the MX922 to create special cards that you just can't buy at the store. One of the biggest flaws about the Canon is that the print speed is slower than average. The Canon can print black and white at 15 ipm and color at 10 ipm which is slower than average. The Canon also prints 4x6 inch borderless photos in 21 seconds which is just average. The MX922 makes up for its slow print speeds with its automatic double sided printing which saves a lot of time and effort.

Scan and Copy Quality - The MX922 scans documents very quickly with its 35-sheet Duplex Auto Document Feeder which automatically feeds in sheets of paper to be scanned. An added bonus to the scanner is the automatic double sided scanning feature which saves time and hassle. The scanning quality is pretty good, and you can barely tell the difference between an original copy and the printed copy. Also, you can either scan to an email address or scan directly to a computer with a cable connection.

Other Features - The MX922 can also print directly from a USB flash drive which I found very useful. You can also print images directly from an online photo album straight from the printers color display. There is also a quiet setting which can be set to activate during specific hours which significantly reduces the printing noise since normally the printer is quite loud. Template print is another useful feature which allows you to print things like notebook paper and graph paper directly from your printer. The MX922 can also print directly onto CDs, a feature you don't see on most printer. Also the printer can automatically open the front flap right before it prints so you don't have to.

Conclusion - The Canon MX922 printer is a great printer which can do just about everything. Its print quality makes up for its slow speed and for the price you won't find a printer that even comes close when it comes to print quality and the number of useful features. The MX922 also has features that you would usually only find on commercial printers such as automatic double sided printing and an automatic document feeder for scanning.

4881,"Our seventh grader's school supply list included one of these holders for the purpose of keeping index cards cataloged.

The PROS for this binder are:
Solid metal rings
The holder can accommodate far more than the fifty included index cards
There is a clear plastic folder flap on the topside to store additional cards or papers.

The CON is:
After only two months into the school year the plastic binder has cracked along the spine and has separated from the metal rings.  The rings no longer line up when they close which leads to the cards getting wrinkled in the top corners and the punched holes in the cards being made larger due to the rings sitting askew.  Loading and unloading of cards has also become more difficult and some cards have begun falling out on one side from the hole ripping entirely through.

Considering that the plastic folder is supposed to protect the cards, I would have hoped that this would have proven to be more durable.  Granted, this binder is being stored in a school locker and is most likely subjected to a higher level of abuse than one stored in a more docile environment like a desk or a briefcase, but as a protector, should there not be a reasonable expectation this should adequately 'protect'?

Overall, this is better than leaving the index cards exposed, and as an organizer this does its job, but users would be better served if it were more rugged.",4,10.156469

Width-wise, 5 writing instruments fit perfectly.

It has a contemporary linear design made of easy to grip special resin, their proprietary plastic that has a warm, soft feel but retains its hard and shiny finish. No other pen company matches this material. What really makes this pen special is the treatment of the metal trim, namely the clip, rings and ferule where the point comes out. These are not coated in shiny gold or platinum like other Mont Blanc pens. They are instead plated with Ruthenium. This renders the metal trim shiny but dark, somewhat difficult to describe but incredible in appearance. Personally, I don't like fancy pens that really look fancy and pricy. When the pen is in your pocket it does not stand out as a silver or gold shiny object, rather it is understated in your pocket and really, really eye catching when out in your hand or on the table.

4886,"I usually go through about 3 badge holders a year because I have to hang several badges on my holder and they break after awhile..  I dislike the necklace kind because I am a nurse, need something that I can disinfect, and hate it when I lean over a patient and my badge and string brush up against something I would rather it not :<(.

I bought 3 different kinds of these for myself and for an easter basket gift for another nurse.

PROS:

-VERY CUTE!!
-String was strong enough to hold my badges without string droopage.
-Colors did not fade or chip after multiple disinfecting with hospital grade solutions!

CONS:

Clip on the back is not the clamp kind but the slide kind.  So if you attach this high to the neckline of you garment/scrub, in a little while it will slide down to your cleavage and pull your top down.
This is a look that I strive to avoid as I am already bending over patients and trying to maintain some modesty.

If you are rough on yours as I am, the badge holding snap can become loose and unsnap over time, but I solve that by putting a little dot of super glue between the snaps the first time I use it and it helps the badge to last until the string breaks or the plastic cracks. ( which probably doesn't happen often to those of you with light badges, but again I have multiple badges and a heavy badge holder on mine.)

Techie tips: The cord from base to handset uses standard 4P4C handset plugs (slimmer than an RJ11 wall jack).

4889,"We have a writer in the household who prints out draft after draft after draft and is always running out of ink. This Epson WorkForce is a money-saver because it's monochrome and the ink is economy-priced. But as an indie publisher who uses print-on-demand (CreateSpace) for all of our books, I need a good scanner that's capable of higher resolutions because I design all of our covers and sometimes need to scan and enlarge artwork. This printer has a scanning resolution of 1200 dpi (main scan) and 2400 dpi (sub scan). The output resolution is selectable from 50 to 4800, 7200, and 9600 dpi, and Epson's scanning technology further boosts the image quality. It DOES scan in color; you just can't print in color. The digital color image is all I need.

At first blush, one would think a monochrome printer would not be as useful as a four-color printer, but when I think about our experiences with four-color printers (always running out of one cartridge or another) and consider the kinds of printing we actually need to do, this Epson WorkForce makes a lot of sense for our home office. Usually, when we are preparing materials for workshop handouts, they are printed in black and white. If we need specialty color items like bookmarks and postcards, we always order them through Overnight Prints. We really don't need the expense and hassle of a four-color printer, but we have one that we will now use sparingly, only when we must print in color.

They work quite well and are of comparable quality to all of the converters that came in my other pens.

If you have a cross fountain pen, there are two different kinds of converters, some that screw in, like for the Bailey model, and some that pushing like for the Townsend and aventura models.  The Corss website has the listing for which one your pen needs. It's a worthwhile investment for the pen considering cross ink cartridges are quite limited.

Most of the time the labels didn't even get up to the printing mechanism, because they slipped too much.

And, with the few that I did get printed - although not positioned correctly on the label, because it had slipped in the printer - the ink smeared when I applied them to the jars, leaving them mostly unreadable.  And yes, I even waited after the labels came out to be sure the ink was set.  Still, the slick surface texture wouldn't take the ink, so they smeared if touched.

We bought it for the 11x17 printing capability. It does a decent job printing that size, but it requires a lot of effort from the user to make sure the paper feeds straight. For some reason too with 11x17 paper, it will double print a section of the paper. Meaning it will start printing the image or text, then it skips a block and will print the skipped portion on top of the next block of info. Super annoying, and have found it happens most when I select it to print several copies at once for 11x17 paper.

4901,"I found the hundreds of comments associated with this product to be very enlightening, and I was grateful to the other commenters for the very detailed overview of this product.

However, there is one issue that I don't remember reading about that came up in my own particular case.  This has to do with the geographic areas that are covered by the Ooma at this point.  I live in Western Maryland, and it turns out that Ooma has not acquired the right to assign phone numbers in my area.  What this amounts to is that when I set up my Ooma I had to be assigned a phone number from Eastern Maryland, which is a long distance call for my next door neighbor.  Fortunately, my former VO IP number was able to be ported.

If you have not picked this up yet, ""porting"" is the term that is used for transferring your current phone number to your Ooma.

I would highly recommend that anyone considering an Ooma who does not live near a major city to call Ooma customer support at 1-888-711-6662 and check to see if they are able to assign a local phone number for you, and if not, if they would be able to port your existing phone number.  Otherwise, you will be stuck with a phone number that is long distance to everyone in your calling area.

Another problem that I ran into had to do with the actual process of getting my phone number ported.  The quick start guide made such a big deal about calling your phone company to disconnect your paid phone service that it did not mention that if you are planning on getting your number ported you need to hang on to your existing phone service until the porting goes through.  In my case, I was getting VO IP phone service from my local cable company, and I had a telephone modem that I wanted to swap out for a regular modem.  The cable company would not allow me to swap my modem until I returned the telephone modem.  I got so involved with this part of the changeover that it was not until I started receiving e-mails regarding my porting request that I realized that I needed to hang on to my original phone service until the porting went through.

By that time, I had already returned my telephone modem and canceled my phone service.  In my case, I think I will be okay because the cable company told me they would hold my phone number until the porting request arrived.  But I would caution other would be Ooma owners who plan on getting a ported number to make sure that they do not cancel their phone service until the porting goes through.

Now that I have my Ooma installed, I am pleased with the service.  Right now, I have my Ooma installed after my router, and my phone call quality is quite good.  I plan to rewire the setup so that my Ooma is installed between my modem and my router.  If you read the knowledge base that is kind of hard to find on the Ooma website, you will find instructions for adjusting the QoS of your Ooma to account for the actual speed of your Internet connection.

With regard to the fees, the Ooma Telo comes with a fee of $12 per year.  When I installed it, I was informed that I was liable for applicable taxes.  There was an applet that allows you to find out what these fees came to.  In my case, in Maryland, these fees come to about $3.50 per month.  I am not sure how these fees are meant to be paid, whether I get a bill, or whether it is taken off my credit card, or what, but I guess I will find out.

That's about all I can think of to add to the already extensive reviews associated with the Ooma.  I would recommend this product to anyone with high-speed Internet service who did not need to keep to some other type of telephone service for their own reasons.

******************************************

This is a post-script to my previous review.  I have had my Ooma in operation for several months now, and I couldn't be happier.  I would amend my recommendation to five stars if I could.  My taxes of about $3.50 per month are automatically debited to my credit card, and my friends cannot believe how low my phone bill is.  The Ooma has turned out to be very reliable, usually with excellent reception.  I occasionally have problems with somewhat low transmission quality, but I am not sure that it is the fault of the Ooma.  I had to call 911 recently, and my call was routed to a center that did not get my address automatically, but did send an ambulance when I told them where to send it to.  I brag about the Ooma to anyone who will listen. HA HA!  I do get regular emails from Ooma, trying to sell me on their expensive Premiere service, but what is the point of paying for that when I bought the Ooma to save money?",3,10.77217

The laminator is great. It's easy to use, works for me every time.  It takes a few minutes to heat up, so I use the time to prep. Then I feed page after page into the laminator.

4903,"I use this all the time despite not liking black inks - the gray colour is definitely different than black, even on absorbent papers. One of the best gray inks and very well behaved (it's more diluted compared to other inks, even in iroshizuku line).",4,4.5025983
4904,"So I'll start with my biggest complaint with this printer.  By biggest, I literally mean my complaint is this printer's size.  It's huge!  When it arrived at my house, the box was so big and heavy, I thought I was being sent TWO printers.  My office has an old Epson, which also prints 13 x 19"", and the Canon Pixma Pro-1 easily dwarfs it in both size and weight.  In fact, it felt twice as heavy as the printer at work, which is why I had to look it up: the Pro-1 weighs in at 61 pounds!  If you're tight on space, but need the ability to print A3, you may want to look into a smaller model, such as one of the Epsons.

Another possible negative for this printer is that, while it supports ethernet, meaning several users can access the printer for various jobs, it lacks wireless.  Of course, thismight not be a big deal for most users (and I can't imagine sending a huge TIFF over wifi for a print job), but other printers in this class offer this feature.  Even Canon's own Pro-10 has wireless capabilities, so it's unusual to me that their top-of-the-line model lacks that feature.

And my final issue with this printer is with the ink.  As others may have noted, this printer drinks ink.  The initial priming dropped the ink levels by 25% and, heaven forbid you leave the printer inactive for too long (like I did), when it runs that priming cycle again, it delivers yet another big hit to your ink levels.  This might not seem like such a big deal, but when you consider that this printer takes 12 cartridges (11 ink and 1 chroma optimizer!) and costs $400 to replace as a set, you can see that this printer is not meant for the casual photographer who prints sporadically (read: ME).  I've only had it for a few weeks and after a handful of prints of various sizes and two priming cycles, I'm at 50%!  Of course, if I printed more regularly, I'm sure I'd see much better ink usage.  I would like to note, though, that this can be seen as a wash, because while it does drink ink, the tanks hold more ink than most other large printers, so you theoretically can make more prints (as long as you avoid that pesky priming/maintenance cycle).

Now while most of my review seems focused on the negatives, it's because they are relatively minor if what you're in the market for is image quality.  If print quality is your main concern, then the Pixma Pro-1 is pretty much the only printer you should be looking at.  Some may argue that if you're printing large, from a distance, most people won't notice a difference between prints from this printer or one from a cheaper, smaller model.  While that may be true for some people, we photographers are a picky bunch and if you're showing off a photo, nothing but the best will do.  And with the Pro-1, you'll want to make sure your lens is tack sharp and your camera packs enough megapixels, because any graininess or softness will show.

And while color prints are eye-popping, it's the monochrome prints that will make any black and white photographer's jaw drop.  Canon uses five (FIVE!) tanks of black and grays, which leads to the best gradation in black and white photos that I have seen from a sub-$1K printer.  I'm talking gallery-quality 13x19"" prints with fantastic contrast and zero tint.  Simply amazing!

Before I wrap up my review, I'd like to throw in some last-minute info that might be important to some readers.  The Pro-1 also includes a tray to allow for direct label printing to CD/DVDs, which I can't comment on, because I never used, though I'm assuming it works in much the same way as any other printer I've used.

Print speed seemed about average, if a little slow, with a 4x6"" color print finishing in about 2 minutes.  And yes, the Pro-1 can print word/text documents, though with the cost of ink, I can't imagine anyone really using it for that other than to avoid the dreaded priming cycle or because their regular printer is down.  Finally, and this might be important to some, while the paper feed can accept media of varying thickness/quality, the Pro-1 can NOT print from paper rolls--cut sheets only.

For me, the Pixma Pro-1 boils down to one thing:  How important is image quality?  Sure you can find another 13x19"" photo printer that can output 90% of the quality at half the weight/size, much less money, and with more interface options.  But there's always that 10%...  If you print a lot of black and white photos or if seeing your work in pristine quality is a top priority, then the Pro-1 should be at the very top of your list.",2,12.605885

While I'm not completely sure what field of science Mr. Burgundy was referencing, as his resplendent mustache twitched about, it's undoubtedly true that men and women are fundamentally wired differently from one another. Never before was this more clear to me, than when I mistakenly borrowed a ""Bic For Her"" pen from my lady friend's purse. As I resumed going about my business, jotting down notes and creating doodles (which were becoming suspiciously flowery in nature, I might add), I had an irresistible craving to take my lunch break at the nearest Olive Garden. Worse yet, I took the rest of the day off, and went home early to watch Nicholas Sparks' ""The Notebook"", followed by a viewing of ""The Vow"".

After adjusting some of the default settings (particularly volume and number of rings before the answering machine picks up), this is proved to be a good choice for her. Here are my observations:

Pros -
+ Good Features; answering machine, speaker phone, and Caller ID
+ Easy Basic Setup; after unpacking it and allowing the battery to charge, the phone is ready for use
+ Easy Message Retrieval; answering machine messages can be retrieved from the base unit, the handset, and remotely
+ Good Range; easily covers both floors of her small house
+ No Interference; this did not conflict with the wireless router also running in her house
+ Long Battery Life; while it will likely decrease over time, the phone has a good amount of ""talk time""
+ Small Base Unit; it does not take up much counter space in her kitchen

Cons -
- Cumbersome Menu; my mom and stepfather could not figure out the menus and even after reading the manual I also had some difficulty finding some settings
- All configuration is done from handset, which can be a little hard to read

Overall this has proven to be a good phone for our needs and I also like that can easily add additional handsets later, if needed.

1.  After a couple of months as my daily writer, the acrylic became brittle on the end of the cap where it threads onto the pen.  The acrylic cracked and eventually broke off.

There will inevitably be a time when you are trying to twist off the cap and instead twist off the barrel of the pen.

Being able to get them in a pack of four is perfect. They stack together nicely and  are a quality product.",3,3.7204266
4916,"First, my strong preference is to purchase items ""sold and fullfilled by Amazon.""  With this item, at least at the time, this was not an option.  So, I was skeptical in purchasing.  Since there were several venders to choose from, I chose ""Myofficeinnovations.""  The package arrived in new condition (as advertised) the SECOND day after I ordered!  Therefore, I am very pleased with this seller.

As far as the product, I have been buying the HP 2 pack of the 53x toner for years.  Lately, it seems that the 2 pack is not as readily available.  I know it's expensive, but there is typically a good savings for the 2 pack.  I was happy to find it on Amazon.

The product appears in all regards to be the genuine HP 2 pack.  And, the price on Amazon was the best I've seen...about $100 less than other vendors elsewhere.

I honestly haven't tried the toner yet, because I'm not to the point of having to replace the current toner I'm using.  The 2 pack was shipped without any additional packaging, but, if my memory serves me correct, the box for the item has protective packaging inside to protect against shipping damages.  So, unless the toner does not work after I install it, I am happy with all aspects of this purchase...delivery speed, condition of item, etc.  And, I would repurchase here on Amazon.

I can now agree with a couple of other posters about the earlier negative comments being outdated, which made me a bit hesitant to puchase this item.  But, I do not believe those posters indicated the seller they used, and the negative reviews were so long ago that I'm assuming the issues back then have now been rectified.",2,10.958464
4917,Extremely cheap for its price and it is excellent on printing of photos of a3+ and below. Not so economical on ink but great photo quality output comparable to lab qualiity photos.,2,5.4649386
4918,"Great product and easy to use.  I first bought one that did negatives and slides but returned and bought this one that does photos as well.  One drawback is that it does not do Polaroid or some other formats until you find how to do it with the three photo size frames they include.  I find I can put Polaroid or other sizes in the larger photo frame side by side and do two at once. Then on my computer I can crop and save them individually.  Obviously that is cumbersome and I can do just one at a time but find that doing two and then cropping works best for me.  I have a lot of old Polaroid pictures I wanted to digitize.  I hope in future releases of the product they will consider including a frame designed for Polaroid pictures but you can make this work now with just a little work.  The images produced from negatives are terrific and same with slides and photos.  Helps of course to read instructions and be sure which side to put up and which down.  And yes, it is cumbersome to work through some of the buttons and learn their system.  But once you do you can go through a lot of pictures in short order.  For the price this is a great machine and anyone wanting to digitize their old pictures from pictures, negatives or slides it is extremely friendly to use and helpful.  I have not found a better one, certainly not for the money",6,8.82122
4919,"I love this product and all my Levenger notebooks and supplies.  Great quality and value.  These notebooks are a great way to get organized and project a professional and organized image to your clients.  I have customized my notebooks with family pictures just inside the covers, and I get compliments on them every day!  These are compatible with other store brand disc bound systems if you need to buy paper in a pinch.  There is no substitute for Levenger quality and performance.  I have bought these for myself and my family.  They have also become my go-to gift idea.  There isn't a high school or college student or graduate out there that couldn't benefit from this system.",9,4.8701963
4920,"omg this printer is better than expected, was thrilled to find it also prints 2 sided pages without the reloading of the pages one use to have to do to accomplish that task, this printer actually prints one side then pulls the page back in to do the other side, it's also very convenient with the front loading paper tray and compact size since my office is a bit cramped and this printer has to set on a shelf, it prints beautifully and so far I've been pleasantly amazed at the ink usage, prints beautifully and seems to use surprisingly very little ink to do so, and just for your info you do not need to buy ink when you purchase this printer since it comes with a full first time use supply, unlike HP or Epson who only give you a small starter pack of ink which is only good for about 3 normal print jobs, i bought this about 2 months ago and i'm still on the initial ink they supplied with the printer and that's after printing 6 8x19 photo's as well, very impressed with how easily it does envelopes, scan's, faxes, and loading the ink from the front is a great feature as well, so far i can't find a single thing that i don't like about this printer, it was so easy to install and the software is also great, the software isn't so behind the times like the Epson, and it's not so territorial and loaded with bloatware like the HP, it's easy, lite, and installs quickly.",89,7.82095
4921,"These pencils are probably THE BEST on the planet for everyday writing and note-taking chores. Of course, I may be exaggerating but having used these Palomino Blackwing 602 pencils for a little more than a week, I'm convinced these are the best I've ever used. What a treat. The graphite glides across the paper like ice on glass. It's pretty amazing to feel. And it makes a bold, black line just the way I like it. The lead doesn't seem to wear as fast as most soft-lead pencils do. The only other pencil I've had that comes close to this type of performance is the Mitsubishi 9850 at more than half the cost of these beauties.",2,5.661384
