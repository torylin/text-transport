""bang bang bang"" i actually liked a lot more than i thought i would just by listening to the :30sec clip. listening to the entire song, it's just a very fun song to sing along with...especially if you've ever had someone stomp on your heart (which who hasn't). the chorus (which was surprisingly catchy to me) says, ""bang bang bang boy, you're going down down down boy...to the ground where you left my heart to bleed. bang! she shot you karma tastes so sweet!"" the lyrics to the verses are a little less simple, not complicated but they say much more than the chorus and they're clever. this song gets 4/5.  ""black & blue"" is a little more mellow than the first track and probably my least favorite on this 5 track ep. i'm not saying the song is bad, because it's not at all. it is in fact very good. at 2:37 the song is pretty short and could've probably been better if she made it longer and added more to it. i can't really say a lot about it because there's not a whole lot to it. what little of it there is, is enjoyable to say the least. this song gets 3/5  ""daydream"" is another mellow song. lyrics, music, christina's voice...just make this an overall great song. the vocal patterns on this song are also very good. she has a very different style than most artists these days. she talks about just loving someone in her daydream rather than in real life so she won't get hurt even though they want to be together. at least, that's what i got from it. i think it's a very good song, especially lyrically because i know i've felt that way before. this song gets 5/5  ""tragedy"" starts off with what i would consider a ""darker"" feel/sound (which i love to hear this sound because it's not done very often). she goes on to sing in the chorus, ""and i won't be made a fool, i don't call this love"". i want to say this is my favorite track on the cd but then i think of the other songs and it's just so hard to choose!!! but right now i think i'm saying this is my favorite track on the cd!! haha. it seems like it's so full of emotion that you feel all the feelings you've had before about a certain situation. i love it. this song gets 5/5  ""jar of hearts"" is to my knowledge the most popular song of christina perri's at the moment and the first song i'd ever heard by her. i obviously think it's good to have looked into her further and purchased this cd as well. she has the video out for this song as well which i think is a beautiful music video. this is how i would want my music video to be if i ever had one. i love the darker look of black and white with ashes and/or dead rose petals falling all around, ballet/interpretative dance, etc. i just love it! back to the song...it's basically about a guy who is what some would call a ""player"", he goes around ""collecting his jar of hearts and tearing love apart"". it's another slower/mellow song with tons of emotion and a voice that sounds so pure and raw. this song gets 5/5  i've said a lot. overall this is a great album, you should buy it. you will love it, you will thank me. you will thank christna perri's parents for bringing her into this world to make awesome music for us to listen to. you will thank christina perri for following her dream/passion of music so that we can all listen to her. trust me.  i'm looking forward to a full length and i cannot wait.",0

in redundant repetition.  it spoke of personal love, often quiet and in struggle, with family and community and savior without ever naming names but also in unmistakable fashion (check out the poignant and almost mesmerizingly simple never forsaken as a grand example).  and these songs could get stuck in your head while ministering to your heart; they could slip from your lip and take on the outpouring of your spirit in petition to the almighty.  its worth your ear to hear.  knott was the vanguard for this project and it can rightly be considered a michael knott project.  his voice covers 7 of the 11 songs (the better known terry taylor lead vocals 2, gene eugene 1, and robert hammond 1) and i believe, though i may be wrong, he wrote or co-wrote all of the non-traditional songs on this release.  michael was a pioneer in the alternative christian music underground scene (as were taylor and eugene) and while he did have several songs where he wore his faith on his sleeve, even if on unconventional shirts or sporting musical tattoos, he rarely ventured into the ccm mainstream or toward what could be described as more traditional praise and worship music/ songs.  this project is the closest he ever came, and its leagues beyond traditional p&w.  its also deeply affecting and introspective.  it displays a mans heart who bleeds brokenness, hope, and mercy.  my only real complaint about this album is that it is a little inconsistent due to its track arrangements (the bouncier songs are all up front with the pared down songs trailing at the end; it doesnt bog the release down but the album could have flowed a bit better if they were arranged to break up these patterns).  4.75 stars.  if youd care to read further and test your eyes and patience im willing to test a few observations about these songs and share some of their lyrical content.  1) on my feet again ~ lead vocals: terry taylor.  wonderful paired piano and guitar give this somber tune its signature sound, along with taylors familiar vocal warble.  the middle is the coldest; somehow its always near, just like these indecisions round my neck all these years.  high, high, high, high.  you put me on my feet again.  high, high, high, high.  without you going nowhere. 2) window ~ lead vocals: gene eugene.  this song shows genes brilliance in his singing and its one of my favorites.  a very sad and yet open-hearted song.  drove all night in fear id die, got lost in the land of popeye, played another gig for no one, slept in a cat-hair bed, headed down to atlanta, passed a poor family that looked in love, smoke was rising up from their grill, they looked at me and smiled.  i see you out my window, in the fields of the forgotten. 3) river of love ~ lead vocals: michael knott.  probably the most accessible and pop-oriented song on the album.  absolutely wonderful, lively piano perfectly playing around a nice rhythm laid out by bass first and then drums.  great song and imminently singable, though knott mumblesings at times!  risen you are, holy you are, the giver of life, the giver of light, the lover of souls, the doer of righteousness.  pour me a bucket from your river of love. 4) simple man ~ lead vocals: taylor.  brings a bit of alt-country flavor to the mix. 5) everything for stormie ~ lead vocals: knott, who talks his way through the songs verses.  mike gives us a glimpse into his home life.  the sound of the song is upbeat, mellow, happy.  the story is a tempered reflection of absent fatherhood with wonderstruck awe of a childs love for their parent. 6) shine ~ lead vocals: knott.  michael has had a penchant for penning thoughts a little left from center and thats on grand display here.  living like a church mouse, looking for scraps, hiding from the cats up somewhere near the bats, deaf from the bell, i hear by what i smell, anyone got some cheese?  i might be lost and disillusioned, i might be running from the wrong side, i might be cracked up and confused, but you're still gonna shine.  nice, pleasant and smooth bass guitar undergirds the rest of the music. 7) call on you ~ lead vocals: knott.  absolutely fantastic and heartbreaking song.  simple piano line and singing, thats all.  call on you most often when it seems that i will never win, getting black and blue, beaten to a pulp by mis-choosed avenues, light i see down the street somewhere turns chilly; dark by the time i get there, everyone is fooling me with happy smiles and half sympathies.  some day ill know you with a smile.  some day ill see you like they do.  but for now ill call on you for help, and cash for bills overdue, and strength that i can influence right, little one i hold so tight, like slingshot breaks, snaps a hand, i know one day ill understand. 8) never forsaken ~ lead vocals: knott.  a song that has become a classic and one that michael has often performed live.  very moving.  check out the live versions of this song on  live in nashvegas, on the quasi-compilation things ive done, things to come, and live at cornerstone 2000.  never forsaken, never low for more than awhile, never mistaken for anyone else but your child.  never left alone, never left alone.  never denied forgiveness and never pushed away, and never far from the goodness that falls from your paths way. 9) lamb of god ~ lead vocals: robert hammond.  a traditional worship song.  a call for god to have mercy on us. 10) holy, holy, holy ~ lead vocals: knott.  a traditional that was simplified and whittled down.  voice and acoustic guitar, with multiple voices joining in on the gently repeating hosannas. 11) within ~ lead vocals: knott.  a strummed guitar hits some almost out of tune chordage.  this song slow builds to each chorus.  effective.  knotts always been good at these types of bare bones structures.  within the tears of the man, we can cry, within the face of temptation, we can try, within the garden, we too can feel alone, within the lord we can live, we can live, within the lord.",1

""what the heck"" has a hilarious vocal arrangement reminiscent of sid king & the five strings, while ""number one on my list"" pairs vocal gymnastics with an unusual descending chord progression that again points up this group's level of musicianship and inventiveness. this excellent and energetic music is highly recommended to collectors of '50s rock & roll.",0

'rest your love on me' is definitely one of his best albums by far! not just saying that either! i actually think the 2 best songs on this are 'once is not enough kind of love' and 'when the feelin's right'. they're probably two of his least popular and rare songs too but i just listened to them and wondered why they aren't on itunes or any other music thing for others to listen to, they're absolutely fantastic and i've seriously no idea why they were not released as hit singles. i just love conway's upbeat tracks with a catchy rhyth and these two have just that. i think his slow and sad ballads that he records now and then don't really allow him to use his fantastic singing voice to his fullest.  but aside from those top two, other outstanding tracks include 'i still believe in waltzes', 'i am the dreamer (you are the dream)', the main hit 'rest your love on me' and 'you'll be back (every night in my dreams)'. 'hero for a day' isn't a huge major classic but still a nice little song, worth listening. 'for all the right reasons' and 'we're gonna try it tonight' are still decent but they are not his best work, they're just more filler tracks and nothing much memorable really but they are likable i guess. worth putting together to complete the 10 track album. i have to say the worst one on here is 'a bridge that just won't burn', which aside from the other great tracks on this album, was actually released as a hit single.. it's just more of a boring/slow song for me which isn't really my kind but others may like it, i'm not sure. but seriously buy this album because it's pure gold. and have a listen to some of conway's 'non-hit single' songs, they tend to be better sometimes!",0

medley of three songs from the show, and cole porter's ""just one of those things""  garner plays mostly standards with showmanship and musical depth. i think that the variety of moods and textures at every moment make each song worth it. he, with the other members of his trio, entertains his audience beautifully, especially on the live album. his style is modern jazz, but not serious bebop like thelonious monk for example.  i understand that sometimes critics have questioned whether garner belongs in the mainstream of serious jazz. when listening to this recording that doesn't seem to me to be worth discussing.  track listing:  just one of those things i'm getting sentimental over you blue lou come rain or come shine the lady is a tramp when you're smiling sweet lorraine dreamstreet mambo gotham oklahoma! medley: oh, what a beautiful morning/people will say we're in love/surrey with the fringe on top  the trio:  erroll garner - piano kelly martin - drums eddie calhoun - bass  recorded on the octave label 1961 and distribured by am-par and is catalog number abcs 365 - this is the stereo pressing.  erroll garner is one of the most distinctive pianists of the jazz genre. other than thelonious monk, no one is more identifiable or harder to imitate. a self-taught virtuoso, garner devised a solo style that eliminated rhythm accompaniment. his hands worked totally independent of each other. with block chords he set the rhythmic tempo in his left hand, and with his right, he embellished on the tune, taking liberties with melody and time, often lagging behind the beat. some jazz purists dismissed him because he maintained his style throughout his career and enjoyed popularity unknown to most jazz artists. but garner's interpretive abilities and technical superiority cannot be denied.  one of the most distinctive of all pianists, erroll garner proved that it was possible to be a sophisticated player without knowing how to read music, that a creative jazz musician can be very popular without watering down his music, and that it is possible to remain an enthusiastic player without changing one's style once it is formed. a brilliant virtuoso who sounded unlike anyone else, erroll garner on medium-tempo pieces often stated the beat with his left hand like a rhythm guitar while his right played chords slightly behind the beat, creating a memorable effect. his playful free-form introductions (which forced his sidemen to really listen), his ability to play stunning runs without once glancing at the keyboard, his grunting and the pure joy that he displayed while performing were also part of the erroll garner magic.  this album marks the release of the first new work recorded by erroll garner in almost three years. after a history-making hiatus from recording, garner is here playing with the greatest freedom of his noteworthy recording career. these sides embody some of the most spirited, inventive, and moving garner performances ever recorded.  garner had unprecendented freedom in recording these works, a circumstance for which he, as prolific improviser, has long striven. time was no factor: there was room for experiment stretch out, and just ""blow""-with complete surety that no material would he released without his personal approval. garner reveled in this atomsphere, as is evidenced by the material herein.  these sides are part of the works recorded by garner and his accompanists the first night, they played from 10 p.m. to 6:30 a.m., the engineer pleaded fatigue. the next evening, garner and company were back in the studio, resuming their uncharted flights into the world of improvisation. in an almost telepathic interplay with bassist eddie calhoun drummer kelly martin, garner soars into new orbit in these works.  those who know garner are aware of his creative chemistry which seems to refurbish itself and energize his accompanists and audience, the more he plays. this vitality permeates these recordings(punctuated by some irrepressible shouts and grunts of exhortation and amens which garner vents along with his mumbled head arrangement heard over the introduction to come rain or come shine.  each number in this album offers a facet of garner's diverse spectrum and rangy attack. his two part inventions played at impossible tempi are a tour de force, as in lady is a tramp, the oklahoma! medley, just one of those things. dreamstreet and mambo gotham were composed by garner at the sessions, joining his large group of originals (which includes misty, dreamy, solitaire, moment's delight, passing through). garner's unique time conception, and ballad ""feel mark getting sentimental over you and sweet lorraine. when you're smiling and blue lou are romps.  acclaimed for almost two decades as one of the most original and individual soloists to emerge from the jazz milieu, the self-taught garner has been termed "" .... a great natural artist, playing natural music."" he is folk-based, in the aural tradition, an amalgam of some of the most primitive and most mature music of his time and culture. garner is one of the most widely imitated artists of his genre.  during garner's three year recording hiatus, many quick trends on the popular music scene, came and passed. all the while, with no regard to fads, ""( ... gamer is always his own man at the keyboard ... a true innovator ... an original)"" garner's intensive involvement with audiences throughout the world was heightened. his artistry transcends time and vogues. his public is of the most hybrid variety, embracing all ages, multi-backgrounds, many tastes.  for those who have not heard garner before, this album should be a treasure trove of discovery. for those who are perpetually rediscovering the creative well springs and joy of garner-who himself, is in a constant state of creative self exploration this long-awaited collection should hold reaffirmation and much gratification.",0

""i'd used jack six in the premiere performance of the oratorio, and of course he'd done some fine work with herbie mann's group and with george wein's newport all stars. it was george who recommended alan dawson as the best possible drummer i could find. he's worked with lionel hampton's band but he's best known as a member of the faculty at the berklee school of music.  ""gerry mulligan had subbed in the old quartet for several nights when paul desmond was having some dental work done. since george already wanted to have, gerry on his mexican tour, i thought it would be exciting if we worked together.""  traveling with the package (brubeck and mulligan, the adderley, mann and wein combos, singer clea bradford and woody herman's band), i was able to observe at first hand how swiftly and easily this excitement had been established. reports had already come in from the new orleans jazz festival about the ovation given to dave and gerry, topped only by louis armstrong himself. with only two full rehearsals and four u.s. concerts under their belt, brubeck and his three new collaborators evolved an immediate rapport. on and offstage, dave and gerry were as relaxed as i had ever seen or heard them.  before the group was two weeks old, a substantial repertoire had been assembled, composed of originals by brubeck and mulligan with a suitable sprinkling of mexican standards.  the gentle, delicate lullabye de mexico was written by mulligan some time ago, but gerry says, ""i never knew what to do with it. but it seemed just right for this occasion.""  dave has a special fondness for the beguiling indian song. ""al walloupe, an indian vaquero on the cattle ranch where i was raised, used to hum incessantly the first two bars, which in reality was the complete song before i extended it. al would then laughingly explain that his forefathers would have sung that short melody for days at a time.""  the public reaction to the new combo was consistently enthusiastic. during two prior visits, brubeck had been established as the most popular norteamericano jazz name in mexico. the addition of mulligan, and the curiosity value of hearing dave in a new context, reinforced an already fervent interest.  like the 1967 tour, the festival started in puebla before moving on to the bellas artes theatre and the national auditorium in mexico city. next came two shows in guadalajara, the first of which was a wildly acclaimed matinee held in a bullring. theatre dates in monterrey and acapulco ended the tour.  the new sounds introduced on these sides confirm the reaction of juan lopez moctezuma and other authoritative mexican critics: these four musicians combine the freshness and enthusiasm of newcomers with the intelligence and maturity of experienced artists.  for brubeck, mulligan, dawson and six, this was a tour that will not soon be forgotten - a happy, cooking ball for all. will they stay together? despite many other commitments, dave concedes that if wein works out a european tour, or anything else that will bring them together again, he won't make any show of resistance.  meanwhile, this will remain a unique and unprecedented album, a sui generis souvenir of a memorable week.",0

""farben"" was also released as a digital cd in 1986.",1

""alien man"" (the second song) is an aggressive tune and tells the story of what it like ""being a loner and a outcast and wanting to punch football players in the face""...as beardo states. the record is a roller-coaster with a common stream of huge guitar riffs, a free spirited screaming voice and 80's sounding drum machines...""keeping production very simple"" as beardo notes. one song beardo recommends is ""24 hour party,"" a song that has been played by los angeles radio stations kroq and kxlu.
