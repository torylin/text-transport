"I thank Chairman McGovern and Congressman Smith for their work to ensure an honest accounting of the situation in Hong Kong, and to ensure accountability for those responsible for the crackdown. We are grateful to Chairman McGovern for his leadership on this PROTECT Hong Kong Act which suspends sales of crowd control technology and other equipment to the Hong Kong Police Force, as Mr. Sherman pointed out earlier. I thank Mr. Sherman for his work on this and thank him for his resolution calling for the Hong Kong Government to address protestors' demands and condemning police brutality, in addition to China's efforts to falsely accuse U.S. diplomats of fueling unrest."
"And the beat goes on. Hopefully, they will hear from this Congress our support for their human rights, and that we will not sell our souls for money at the expense of our values. I also want to thank the distinguished chairman of the committee, Mr. Eliot Engel, for his leadership on all of this over time. I urge an ``aye'' vote on all of the above to join in bipartisan, bicameral support for the people of Hong Kong."
"We have seen the police firing rubber bullets and bean bag rounds at peaceful protesters at close range. We have seen them launching teargas canisters, from high buildings and directly at individuals, into crowded and enclosed areas. We have seen them failing to give demonstrators visible and audible warning before firing, and we have seen them use batons to beat and subdue demonstrators and disperse journalists. In fact, the situation has been so bad that in June, the British Government suspended export licenses for the sale of teargas and crowd control equipment until concerns about human rights abuses are addressed."
"The people of Hong Kong have the right to peaceably assemble without fear of violence. They need to know that their friends in the United States are not providing tools of the violent repression being used against them. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support H.R."
"I want to first focus on a resolution I introduced with our colleagues, Mrs. Wagner; Mr. Connolly; and Mr. Yoho, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation, my partner on the Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation Subcommittee. This resolution demonstrates that the so-called extradition bill is an infringement on the rights of the people of Hong Kong, including their right to a high degree of autonomy, autonomy that was granted to Hong Kong when that city was returned to the control of Beijing. This resolution also establishes that the House of Representatives stands with Hong Kong protestors and supports their five major demands."
"These demands are:  Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill;  Universal suffrage in the election of the chief executive and all members of the Legislative Council;  The establishment of an independent commission to investigate the police's excessive use of force against the protestors;  The changing of the classification so these protests are not classified as riots and the participants are not classified as rioters; and, finally,  Having all charges against the people who participate in these protests dropped. Many of us in Congress and around the United States have been inspired by the people of Hong Kong standing up for their fundamental rights over the last few months. One of the protests brought nearly 25 percent of the entire population of Hong Kong into the streets."
"I applaud the efforts and sacrifices pro-democracy activists have made and they should know that the United States fully supports their desire for freedom and peace, and strongly condemns the violent and oppressive tactics of the Hong Kong police. As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, I support the bilateral relationship between Hong Kong and the United States and the promotion of international peace."
"There has been a lot of action on it, and I want to thank Senator Rubio and Senator Cardin, who are the lead supporters of this bill and who have, on behalf of the committee, done yeoman's work getting it together and getting the bipartisan compromise to get the language here. Also, virtually all members of the committee have had fingerprints on this bill, and so in that regard, I think it is going to pass quite handily. I want to thank the Banking staff, particularly my colleague from Idaho, Senator Crapo, who, of course, has the expertise--the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee--on these kinds of things on sanctions. They were very helpful in hammering out the language that we needed for the sanctions. I want to thank the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee staff, who were helpful."
"This bill is the result of a strong, strong bipartisan consensus that we must act in support of the Hong Kong people. Thank you all for helping. We will get to the unanimous consent here in a little bit. I yield the floor to Senator Cardin."
"The bill will freeze the assets and travel of officials who are responsible for abducting Hongkongers, like journalists, booksellers who have been vanishing without a trace since 2017, and it will ensure that pro-democracy protesters cannot be denied visas to the United States despite their specious arrests. But if the Hong Kong Chinese Communist Party will simply pull back from the brink, if they will keep their promises, if they will respect their one-country, two-system approach, none of this will happen. So Beijing has a promise."
"Some of you may realize that we, just a few months ago, celebrated the 30th anniversary of the bloody crackdown that ended the peaceful democracy movement in Tiananmen Square. Who among us can forget those riveting weeks during which there was real hope and possibility of China opening its political system--the Goddess of Democracy statue modeled after our own Statue of Liberty--and, sadly, the jarring image of the protestor that was standing to try to block the onslaught of a tank? The crude propaganda and disinformation used by Communist hardliners to brainwash young military conscripts to turn on their own people was both heartbreaking and infuriating."
"What exactly are Hong Kong protesters fighting for--the freedoms we in America take for granted every day--the freedom of assembly, suffrage, speech, due process, and rule of law. Rather than sitting down with the protesters, Hong Kong authorities have increasingly used excessive force instead of engaging in constructive dialogue."
"Hong Kong's continued special status is the sign of strength and confidence, not weakness. I yield the floor."
"We all remember that famous image. Times have changed, but one thing stays the same: Wherever totalitarian regimes exist, there will be brave freedom fighters who will stand up against injustice and stand for human rights. That is what we are seeing in Hong Kong today. Beijing soldiers have been appearing on the city streets, raising questions about the army's future role."
"And I just want to say to those protesters that you are making a difference, that your lives have made a difference, and to those who even now are trapped inside PolyU in this siege that the Hong Kong police force has created--this humanitarian crisis that the Hong Kong police force has fostered--what you are doing is inspiring the world. What you are doing has moved this body."
Everyone else must do theirs as well. The United States and the world must stand with Hong Kong.
"Thirty years since Tiananmen Square and Chinese authorities are still turning to violence and intimidation to crush dissent and attack basic freedoms. With this important legislation, we send a clear signal that the United States stands with the people of Hong Kong. Mr. Speaker, I hope all Members will join me in supporting the passage of this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time."
"All nations who trade with the PRC should be watching the drama unfolding on the streets of Hong Kong. The world is watching and wondering: If a government cannot respect the basic rights of people it claims as its own citizens, why on Earth would it be trusted to respect the rights and interests of its neighbors, its trading partners, or the companies that invest in its economy? As we all know, the people of Hong Kong have been carrying the banner for decades."
"Such bipartisan, bicameral legislation supporting the people of Hong Kong is a testament to the relationship between our two peoples, but it is also an indication of Congress' deep concern over the growing violence in Hong Kong. In recent weeks, we have seen an escalation in the conflict between Hong Kong's security forces and the people of Hong Kong. The same police forces sworn to protect the people are now indiscriminately targeting people with tear gas, pepper spray, and water cannons. I am particularly heartbroken over the images of students under siege and parents begging the police not to shoot their children."
"I am glad this bill is before us. After it passes, it goes to the President, and I fully expect he will sign it into law. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2710, the Placing Restrictions on Teargas Exports and Crowd Control Technology to Hong Kong Act, otherwise known as the PROTECT Hong Kong Act. I am proud to have introduced this bipartisan legislation, along with my colleagues Chris Smith from New Jersey and Ro Khanna from California, in the House. Senator Merkley and Senator Cornyn introduced it in the Senate."
"It has been a very unifying issue for us, whether we are talking about the autonomy of Tibet that the Chinese are trying to destroy, the culture, the language, and the region of Tibet; the Uighurs, where 1, 2, 3, maybe 3 million Uighurs are under education camps, which the Chinese Government says they really enjoy being in--Oh, really?--or human rights violations, suppression of human rights throughout all of China. {time}  1545  If America does not speak out for human rights in China because of commercial interests, we lose all moral authority to speak out on human rights elsewhere. Since Tiananmen Square, many of us in a bipartisan way have been fighting this fight, and we have seen that commercial interests always win the fight."
"It has always for them been about money. To those who take the repressive Chinese Government's side, I say: What does it profit a person to gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his soul?"
"I urge a ``yes'' vote on both of these bills. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul), the ranking member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise today in support of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. Two months ago I had the opportunity to join a press conference with Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Chairman Engel, my colleague, Chris Smith, and Hong Kong prodemocracy activists Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, and Denise Ho to denounce China's authoritarian brutality. I said it then and I will say it again; today we stand here not as Republicans or Democrats, but as Americans united in our strong support for Hong Kong. And I would like to take this opportunity to speak directly to the people of Hong Kong, who I know are watching this right now. America stands with you, and America will always support you."
"This is a battle between democracy versus dictatorship, liberty versus tyranny, and freedom versus oppression. This bill sends a clear message to China that there will be consequences to the ruthless and brutal actions."
"Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill). Mr. HILL of Arkansas."
"Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey, my good friend, for yielding, and I have to thank him for his decades of service and leadership here for free expression and for liberty in Hong Kong. I was moved by the Speaker's tribute and appreciate her 30 years of work there. I thank Mr. Engel for his leadership, and, of course, my good friend from California, who now is controlling the time for the majority."
"Today, once again, we show the world our commitment to the people of Hong Kong and to the preservation and protection of Hong Kong's autonomy, given China's aggressive attempts to undermine the ``one country, two systems'' approach. With this important legislation, we send a clear signal that the United States will hold those undermining Hong Kong's rights and autonomy accountable and that the American people stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Hong Kong. With few exceptions, the people of Hong Kong have fought for their rights through peaceable protest, and we stand with them."
"The people of Hong Kong wave American flags during their protests as a symbol of the freedoms that they desire. Now is the time for Congress to support the people of Hong Kong and pass Representative Chris Smith's bill, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. This measure states without question that the United States Government supports the people of Hong Kong and their right to freedom of expression and democratic governance guaranteed under their 50-year arrangement agreed to in 1997 by China and the United Kingdom."
"That is specific in our law. I question, as I think many of us do, whether Hong Kong and China are complying with the conditions under which the United States passed the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 that allows for preferential treatment in Hong Kong that is not enjoyed by China. Last week, Senator Rubio and I, with the support of the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, introduced the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. It reaffirms the act that we passed in 1992 to make it clear that Hong Kong's recognition by the United States and its trading relationship with the United States and its special relationship with the United States--much different from China--only exist if the conditions on autonomy are maintained."
