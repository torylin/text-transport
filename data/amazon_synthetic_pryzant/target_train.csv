""i'm a brass band"" is charity's joyous declaration of being blissfully in love, very charming, and also was done on the sullivan show by ms. verdon.  my personal favorite however is the raw, pulsating lament ""where am i going?"" which shows off ms. verdon's talent as a dramatic actress as charity comes to a crossroads in her life and doesn't know what path to take.  this song musically was so challenging, that sometimes gwen verdon would cut it on matinee days, which was a pity.  her comic sense is well displayed in two wry numbers, ""you should see yourself"", and ""charity's soliloquy"".  listening to her inimitable voice, gwen verdon's unique star quality shines through.  the listener is able to realize why along with ethel merman and mary martin, ms. verdon was one of the american musical theatres' most treasured female assets in the latter half of the twentieth century.  ""big spender"" is the other standard that came out of the show, as the dance hall hostesses led by nickie (helen gallagher) and helene (thelma oliver) try to entice potential customers in an aggressive yet deadpan manner.  there is a staccato, latin sounding number for charity, nickie and helene when all three are weary of the dance hall and dream of escape ""there's gotta be something better than this"", where you can hear and imagine the vigorous dancing that accompanies it.  helen gallagher has a very funny moment where she nails down a ny urban accent ""but baby, what can you doo?"" misses. gallagher and oliver sparkle in a sardonic, bouncy pop duet ""baby dream your dream"".  the male lead john mcmartin playing oscar, charity's neurotic boyfriend gets to sing the title number ""sweet charity"" and has a low keyed ingratiating duet with ms. verdon called ""i'm the bravest individual"".  finally i don't want to forget the instrumental ""the rich man's frug"" which always gives me a smile, it is such an on the head parody of 1960's music heard at then trendy discotheques like ""arthur"" or ""the peppermint lounge"".  i can imagine the ""beautiful people"" doing the ""frug"" and the ""watusi""!  the extras are very special, we are transported back to the opening night on january 29, 1966 as radio announcer fred robbins records the curtain calls, with the audience going wild, followed then by interviews at the party at the skylight roof of the waldorf - astoria where he interviews an exuberant ethel merman who sings the praises of gwen verdon, a gratefully articulate helen gallagher for whom this was a broadway comeback and neil simon who touches on his writing inspirations.  lastly, it's gwen verdon's turn, who though gracious, seems somewhat reserved and detached as if her mind was elsewhere.  there is also the first release of ""i love to cry at weddings"", hardly different from the final cut.  finally composer cy coleman sings a trio of songs, in a pleasant voice much better than stephen sondheim on the ""anyone can whistle"" cd.  one song ""you wanna bet"" was reworked with a different tempo and lyrics into the title tune ""sweet charity"".  the booklet is nicely done with black and white photos, the original liner notes that were on the album, and an interview with cy coleman from the late nineties.  the stereo sound is clear and sharp, and a tip of the hat to the late producer and president at columbia records goddard lieberson who did such an impeccable job preserving these broadway jewels from the glory days of the broadway musical.  forget about the shirley maclaine, debbie allen, and christina applegate recordings, this is the definitive version and at $7.99 it's a real bargain!",0

(it  really never is.) their sound is masculine and yet young. ideals good enough for me!  all the texts are printed except for the christmas tracks. there are no translations, but frankly i don't care.  the dedication to their art and the sublime assurance they already show gives il divo a firm run for their money - and il volo wins.",0

( blackmore's cd's have the same problem).  since the guitar and keyboards basically make  most of the music, they need to replace them and get some fresh writing.  on this cd, i only liked 2 out of 12 songs, which is not so good. up to blackmore's departure, i would love all or nearly all of each cd.  it's a shame, because they all are wonderful musicians, but  most of the songs  just don't do it for me.  i always vowed to buy any cd that purple put out, but after so many so -so cd's, i think i've had it with this lineup.  the dvd was ridiculous in the fact that there is a long interview with the band, and then 3 audio tracks, which have one great song live.  when you spend 15 bucks for a cd/dvd,  there should be some great concert footage on it, not interviews and audio tracks.  what were they thinking?  as long as blackmore and lord are gone, they will only be as good as their old material.  but for the devoted fans of purple like me, there is a few good songs to add to your ipod.",1

""prism"" (deluxe version) by katy perry is definitely recommended if you enjoyed katy perry and/or you like music collections sprinkled with pop, hip-hop, and eurodance melodies.",0

""yeha noha"" takes you into the mind of an eagle as it soars high above the earth swirling to the sky. you can feel the energy in the sky and see the sun rising. they say if you see an eagle soaring up to the sky, it means good things will happen to you. this title of this song means: ""wishes of happiness and prosperity.""  sweet lullaby makes you think of the scent of rain and fresh earth, perhaps a walk through an african veld in the afternoon while you listen to the beat of drums somewhere in the distance.  a good set of speakers or headphones is a must so you can enjoy all the nuances of this collection. this music will engulf a room and promotes peace, joy and a feeling of harmony with life. you can literally drift away to another world by listening to this music. it is very uplifting and evokes images of peaceful places and blissful journeys.  ""chi mai"" is an incredibly sad piece of music so i guess this is not all joy and happiness but there is a certain poignancy in the music which speaks to future happiness and an feeling of being engulfed in love no matter what happens in life.  ""prelude"" will take you to india. yanni's music was my first introduction to mood music and it is fitting that his music is on this cd.  ""cavatina"" is a beautiful piece which is extremely evocative of romance and country picnics. happiness and hope are the feelings this music will evoke in you. perhaps the start of a new day.  on the second cd, ""children"" is a deep water piece which reminds me of whales playing in the ocean and of ships sailing in the wind. you can almost hear the cries of whales. the beat is very up tempo and is in contrast with the first cd which seems to be a slower pace. you never want the song to end and it does seem to have the feeling of eternity.  ""chacharpaya"" has south american/mexican flair and is filled with flutes and drums.  ""protection"" was more light smooth jazz. ""the sun rising"" is perhaps the best song on this cd as far as mood music goes.  ""sadness part 1"" will be one of the most recognizable songs. ""brideshead"" is classic music with violin and harp and is followed by ""pie jesu"" which is ethereal. ""schindler's list"" is a haunting piece with a sad violin and a sense of unfulfilled dreams.  there were a few pieces i fast forwarded over, but overall, i think you will enjoy this set. i would choose this imported selection over the other cd's because you just get so many more selections. i think you will play the first cd more than the second, but it depends on your mood. return to your senses with this beautiful compilation.  ~the rebecca review",1

""crystal's eyes,"" for example, is the equivalent of paul mccartney's ""maybe i'm amazed,"" and ""soldier of fortune"" is one of the better irish-themed songs out there. mike nile plays the bass, which doesn't often happen these days, and it's a shame because he's one of the better bass players out there. i wonder what it would have sounded like if the other indulgers had played on the cd, but the difference isn't necessarily a bad thing.  i suggest a letter-writing campaign until he agrees to sing this stuff in concert again.  the other mystery is why he'd put out a cd full of irish ballads, take a cover photo in the guinness brewery, and then adopt an anglicized stage name. he's thankfully reverted back since.",0

(what perished, rise again!)"" at full volume and it sent chills through my body, unlike this performance! this is how the great conductors have done it in their recordings like bernstein, mehta, levine, abbado, solti and possibly others i have not heard yet. even janson's own older recording with the olso is much better than this one:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/symphony-2-in-c-minor-resurrection/dp/b000000aa7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8"">symphony 2 in c minor resurrection</a>. however, i loved the chorus' basses nice voluminous full b-flat below the bass clef (the lowest note ever written for basses) which comes across better than any other recording i've heard. it's heard 3 times in the hushed entrance and again on the words ""h&ouml;r'auf zu beben"".  the dvd would not play in my blu-ray/dvd player, so i had to watch it on my computer. i see much passion on jansons' face and conducting but it is not being translated to the concertegouw orchestra or the netherlands radio choir.  in all, i came away from this performance extremely unsatisfied and unfulfilled. when it comes to mahler, janson's should have known better, plus we pay premium prices for sacd format, so i at least expect passion, so i give this 2 stars, that's what i feel it deserves.",1

everyone says this is the album, the masterpiece, the hendrix sgt pepper, even rolling stone mag bows down before it. huh? well, let's look-see...  bear in mind that bob dylan and frank zappa threw pop convention out the window three years earlier and released the first ever double lps from the pop-rock community; the double lp had basically been the providence of jazz performers like ella who released a number of them; then donovan released a gift from a flower to a garden in a fashionable box with trinkets in '67; and cream's wheels of fire in '68. chicago would make the trend a habit beginning in '69 and progressive rock acts would make it almost a requirement after that. my purchase of the album was after it had become fashionable, but in october of '68, jimi had joined an elite handful of artists with great expectations. now that fabulous double dinner treat fits on one cd but it's a full cd with a smorgasbord of sound!  jimi likes to ask his listeners pertinent questions before he kicks off the set. in '67 it was are you experienced? 15 months later: have you ever been to electric lady land? both albums answered the questions with amazing results, but ladyland simply entreats the audience to a diversity of compositional talent which is unprecedented (at least at that time): psychedelic sounds and experimental guitar works, pop, rock, and r&b confections, jazz licks and blues jams; ladyland is like a premiere at an art gallery. it chomps off huge chunks of varietal genre, fuses them together or lays them down against each other in odd meter and arrangement, the end result is one of the most satisfying demonstrations of crossover musicianship you will ever encounter. and when you listen to tunes like his cover of earl king's come on you will understand, you will perceive where the likes of stevie ray vaughan and joe bonamassa arose from. little miss strange seems almost out of place as a 60's pop-rock candy tune with noel redding on the mike, but pay attention to guitar layers, the wah-wah, fuzz, fills, and solos, anything but bubblegum folks! the live voodoo chile and its' slight return variant are sheer monuments in music history, and the psychedelic stretch from rainy day to still raining is one of the best guitar god runs ever laid down on tape. let's not forget that all along the watchtower teams the ""voice of our generation"" with one of the greatest guitar-god icons ever, into a smoldering track that featured revolutionary guitar and bass work all laid down by jimi himself, a song that has become a soundtrack piece defining an era and one of the greatest recordings of all time.  young dude's: if you are wondering ""what jimi hendrix album should i buy?"" can't recommend this one enough. yes, i know, are you experienced is an attractive issue, being the debut and containing huge amounts of popular hendrix trax, and it is definitely an item you should own (be sure to pick up the re-issue containing red house which was only available on the uk release for years, red house is one of hendrix' best recordings as well)... but... electric ladyland is jimi's definitive masterpiece, his magnum opus, the pure art gallery of all his talent distilled into one creative everest.",1

 despite the upbeat dance nature of the song, ""darkness"" is actually quite sad.  the song is about  one wanting to be loved and be in love.  she wants to disappear in the dark and sadness where stars don't shine.  she wants to be in love with this guy, but it's one-sided love and feels she will be chasing after the guy for all of eternity, so she wants to hide in the deep darkness.  the third track is titled ""sore wo seishu to yobu hi"" and is performed by tabidachi sotsugyou-gumi (journey alumni) which consists of the nine graduating members of ske48: kumi yagami, mizuki kuwabara, shiori takada, kanako hiramatsu, shiori ogiso, ririna akaeda, kasumi ueno, minami hara and emiri kobayashi.  a sad but hopeful graduation song of each member singing about being in the theater in front of an audience to say their goodbye.  saying thank you to everyone and remembering the days of singing and dancing with friends and looking at their locker of the things they cherished.  and as they prepare for the future, they hope that they can come back someday to see their friends that they have grown up with along the way.  the remainder of the three tracks are the instrumental versions of the first three vocal tracks.  as for the dvd, the dvd begins with the music video of ""choco no dorei"" and focuses on ske48 performing and dancing on stage, with videos of the members practicing their choreography, stretching and visiting the theater.  the second music video is for ""darkness"", members of the seven dancers are dressed up in suits and are seen performing the song on stage and showcasing their choreography.  the third and final video on the dvd features part 1 of the group's third year anniversary challenge celebration.  the members of ske48 walking into a restaurant and jurina matsui and rena matsui greet their fellow members to celebrate the group's third anniversary, while everyone is having fun eating.  afterward, the group partakes in putting pantyhose on their heads and which team can walk with pantyhose with the farthest distance without breaking it or having it come off their heads.  it's important to note that this is a region 2 dvd and will not play on a region 1 player (unless you have a non-region dvd player) but can be played on a mac or pc using free video playing software such as vlc or daum potplayer.  judgment call:  overall, ""choco no dorei"" (type-a) is a pretty cool cd+dvd and is possibly my favorite ske48 single yet.  featuring three awesome songs and also as an ske48 fan, to have the graduation track is a must but ""darkness"" by 7 dancers is an awesome song!  also, the dvd content is very cool and this includes the first part of the ske48 3rd anniversary celebration (a reminder that if you want the other two parts, you will need to purchase type-b and type-c).  featuring two pretty cool upbeat dance track and the graduation song plus a dvd with an hour's worth of cool content, ""choco no dorei"" (type-a) is highly recommended!",1
