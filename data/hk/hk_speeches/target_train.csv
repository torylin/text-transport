"In Congress, Democrats and Republicans, in the House and in the Senate, stand united with the people of Hong Kong. If America does not speak out for human rights in China because of commercial interests, then we lose all moral authority to speak out for human rights anyplace in the world. Since Tiananmen Square 30 years ago, many of us, in a bipartisan way, have been fighting this fight, and we have seen that commercial interests always win. It is always about the money."
"Today, the House is proud to pass the bicameral and bipartisan Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act to reaffirm America's commitment to democracy. And that doesn't mean a democracy like this. It means democratic freedoms, human rights, and the rule of law in the face of Beijing's crackdown."
"Among them are a fierce belief in the freedom of speech, and the right to assemble. That is why the American people are so troubled by the images coming out of Hong Kong lately. Hundreds of thousands of protesters who have taken to the streets have been met with increasing violence by the Hong Kong Police Force. These pro-democracy activists faced teargas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets by the police force sworn to supposedly protect them. I remember when China took over Hong Kong from the U.K. and said that they would adhere to a system of two systems in China, and that the people of Hong Kong would have freedom like they had before to speak their mind."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4270, the ``PROTECT Hong Kong Act.''"
"I rise in support of all these bills before us today, particularly the bill from my friend from New Jersey, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, and I stand in solidarity with all freedom-loving people in Hong Kong. For more than 4 months, we have witnessed Hong Kong citizens peacefully protest for the right to live in a free and fair political system. Over my years, I have traveled to Hong Kong and witnessed their innovative spirit and work ethic."
"In fact, Hong Kong was the model for the post-World War II growth of the Asian Tigers in their prosperity and innovation. {time}  1545  In the 1980s, when a proponent of welfare statism queried pro-growth economist Melvyn B. Krauss:  ``But how many Hong Kongs can the world have?'' Dr. Krauss replied, ``As many as the world will allow itself.'' Freedom lovers should rally to that wisdom. This summer, I had the opportunity to hear directly from leaders in Hong Kong dedicated to religious tolerance and democracy as promised in the one country, two systems agreement."
"Madam President, on June 9, the streets of Hong Kong filled with over 1 million individuals peacefully protesting what they saw as an unjust law and attack on democracy. It was an incredible visual of people standing up for democracy and standing up for human rights. Here we are 5 months later, and the images are much different."
"However, since that time, China has gradually chipped away at Hong Kong's autonomy, and this is now becoming a real problem. China now refers to its treaty with Great Britain as ``a historical document,'' and says it is no longer bound by its terms. This is just one of many examples that show that the Chinese Government has no respect for the rule of law. After two decades of broken commitments, it is past time that we hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable. What it is doing in Hong Kong is just wrong. That is why I am proud to join Senator Rubio and Senator Cardin and all the others who have had hands on this bill in bringing the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act to the Senate floor."
"Madam President, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act is really about promises--making promises and keeping promises. Unfortunately, the Chinese Communist Party has a long history of making promises but not keeping them. You can ask a rice farmer from Stuttgart. You can ask a software programmer from Fayetteville, a factory worker from Fort Smith, or a Christian missionary from Searcy. In this case, China promised in 1984 that it would uphold the ``one country, two systems'' approach to Hong Kong when it took over in 1997, a promise to preserve the freedoms that have made Hong Kong distinctive--the freedom to practice one's religion as one sees fit, to speak one's mind, and to participate in the political process."
"But that is just another promise they are on the verge of breaking. Apparently, the ``one country, two systems'' approach can't satisfy Beijing's rapacious appetite. They look at and covet Hong Kong's wealth, and they fear and loathe its freedom, which stands in shining contrast to the Orwellian oppression on the mainland."
"So Beijing has a promise. Keep its promises, or give Americans and the world one more reason to treat China like an outlaw regime."
"Will they once again stand against those fighting for human rights and democracy? Will the United States stand by and allow this to happen? We are seeing Americans like Michael Bloomberg putting profits above human rights and propping up the Chinese Government by continuing to host huge events in Communist China. It is time for the world to stand and present a unified front against Communist China's aggression, and that starts with supporting the brave people of Hong Kong."
"To the brave and resilient people of Hong Kong, the United States is with you. Your fight will not be in vain, and it does not go unnoticed. And to Communist China and General Secretary of the Communist Party Xi, consider your next moves carefully."
"To the people of China: We stand with you in freedom. To the kids in Hong Kong, the students and the adults: We stand with you. To the Uighurs who simply want to practice their religion: We stand with you."
It makes clear that the United States will stand up for Hong Kong's autonomy and democratic aspirations of its people. It beefs up reporting so that we can track any efforts by China to interfere in Hong Kong's affairs and to use Hong Kong to avoid U.S. export controls. It slaps sanctions on anyone responsible for undermining Hong Kong's autonomy or violating Hong Kongers' humans rights. This bill sends a strong message to China that the United States stands with the people of Hong Kong.
"Two days ago, Reuters reported that President Xi Jinping told leaders in Nepal, ``Anyone attempting to split China in any part of the country will end in crushed bodies and shattered bones.'' President Xi's government excels in crushing bodies, shattering bones, torturing dissidents, and filling concentration camps, massive crimes against humanity, for which there has been little or no accountability or sanctioning. But today, Mr. Speaker, we are simply urging the Chinese President and the Hong Kong Chief Executive--and we have that obligation under our own laws--to faithfully honor the government's promises. Honor the promises made in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration that facilitated the conveyance of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to China beginning on July 1, 1997, that autonomy, human rights, including press, assembly, association, and religion, would be exactly the same as before the handover for at least 50 years. Honor the promises made in the ``Basic Law'' of Hong Kong adopted by China's National People's Congress in 1990, before the giveback of Hong Kong, that autonomy and rights would be protected."
"We must use our leverage to help the people of Hong Kong in their struggle to secure a democratic future that protects Hong Kong's autonomy and way of life. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this legislation, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey."
"The PRC has long been working hard under the surface to increase its influence and power. In Hong Kong, like in so many other areas, China has used this approach that experts have called ``hide and bide''--hiding their intentions and biding their time, slowly slicing away resistance, building leverage, and encroaching, one step at a time. In the case of Hong Kong, Beijing and its agents have overreached, but they are recalculating--postponing action on this legislation while biding time to resume the encroachment. This is not just a matter of the people of Hong Kong."
"Mr. Speaker, since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre 30 years ago, I have had the privilege of working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle, including, and especially, Speaker Pelosi,  Jim McGovern, my good friend--and he is the chairman of the China Commission, and I am ranking member--and Congressman Frank Wolf, a former Member who was tenacious in his fight for human rights, the rule of law, and democracy for the people of China. We have always believed that every person deserves better than the brutality so many endure in the systematic violations of their universally recognized human rights. China's ruthless dictators do not agree, and they are driven--they are obsessed--to tighten their control."
"To those who take the repressive Chinese Government's side, I say: What does it profit a person to gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his soul? Today the House is proud to once again pass the bicameral, bipartisan Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act to reaffirm America's commitment to human rights, democracy, and the rule of law in the face of Beijing's crackdown. I see we have been joined by the distinguished ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. McCaul. I thank him for his leadership in bringing this legislation to the floor."
"Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul), the ranking member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise today in support of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. Two months ago I had the opportunity to join a press conference with Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Chairman Engel, my colleague, Chris Smith, and Hong Kong prodemocracy activists Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, and Denise Ho to denounce China's authoritarian brutality. I said it then and I will say it again; today we stand here not as Republicans or Democrats, but as Americans united in our strong support for Hong Kong."
"Xi Jinping, along with his cohorts' lack of acknowledgment of their failures, whether from deliberate denial or complete ignorance, was demonstrated by Mr. Han Zheng, China's Vice Premier, who said he believes antigovernment protests are damaging the ``one country, two systems'' formula, and again, are caused by a separatist movement and foreign influence. While sitting next to Chief Executive Carrie Lam, he continued, ``We firmly support the Special Administrative Region Government to adopt more proactive and more effective measures'' to solve the social problems. Since I wrote this, they have come out and said they expect to have brutality ramped up to bring these people under control. The proactive and more effective measures referred to by Mr. Han Zheng are intimidation, brutality, imprisonment and death."
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman's time has expired.
"Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Florida an additional 1 minute. Mr. Speaker, as the international community is well aware, Beijing's standard procedure for dealing with unrest is well documented."
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York?
"There was no objection. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey."
"When a proponent of welfare statism queried progrowth economist Melvyn B. Krauss, ``But how many Hong Kongs can the world have?'' the professor responded, ``As many as the world will allow itself.''"
"Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, the United States' and the world's response to the Tiananmen Square massacre 30 years ago and the massive crackdown that was unleashed after that, because of that weak response, has enabled unrelenting and pervasive human rights abuses ever since. Had we been strong and predictable and said that human rights matter, had we linked it to MFN, most-favored-nation status, and stuck to it, we would have had a different China today that, at least more than it does today, would have respected the rule of law and human rights. We cannot recommit that mistake by being weak and vacillating in the face of this terrible, terrible attack on the people of Hong Kong and on their autonomy."
"This is a bill very similar to the one introduced in this House by the gentleman from New Jersey. This House has already voted on this bill and supported it overwhelmingly. Today, once again, we show the world our commitment to the people of Hong Kong and to the preservation and protection of Hong Kong's autonomy, given China's aggressive attempts to undermine the ``one country, two systems'' approach. With this important legislation, we send a clear signal that the United States will hold those undermining Hong Kong's rights and autonomy accountable and that the American people stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Hong Kong."
"I am eager to continue working with colleagues, such as Senator Risch, Senator Graham, Senator Rubio, and others, toward a strong and procedurally workable solution. Meanwhile, I appreciate statements by administration leaders such as Vice President Pence and Secretary Pompeo that show a clear-eyed perspective on China's Orwellian tactics and bad intentions. I urge the administration to use the significant leverage and authorities it already has, particularly under the Global Magnitsky Act, to hold individuals accountable. Hong Kong is not the only recent reminder that we live in a dangerous world in which America's interests, allies, and ideals are constantly threatened."
"Syria, under Assad, stands alongside Iran as the chief patron of anti-Israel terrorism. This is just another reminder that the United States and some of our closest allies have a strong say in the future of Syria and that a victory for Assad will be a victory for Iran and for terrorism. So every hour seemingly brings more evidence of our troubled world, but, just as with the trade agreements, critical legislation in this area is currently frozen in place."
"Lam Wing-kee is one example. I can give many examples. In 2015, he mysteriously disappeared. He was selling literature in Hong Kong that was banned by the Chinese Communist Party in China, not Hong Kong, supposedly."
"We first applied it to Russia. We then applied it globally. Now we have seen other countries also apply these sanctions where if a person violates basic, internationally recognized human rights, that individual is denied the opportunity to visit America by not allowing any visa or the use of our banking system. We extend those types of sanctions in regard to those who are violating the rights of the people of Hong Kong. Let me point out that our foreign policy--our strength is American values."
