  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday the U.S. Senate spoke up 
forcefully and clearly for the brave people of Hong Kong. We 
unanimously passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.
  As the author of the original United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 
1992, and somebody who has advocated for Hongkongers for decades, I was 
proud to speak out on this back in the summer when the protests began. 
I was also proud to secure important policy steps for Hong Kong in the 
Senate Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs 
back in September.
  I am also proud that Senators approved these further steps to update 
the original law to preserve Hong Kong's autonomy and democracy and 
provide more tools for holding Beijing accountable.
  I want to thank the senior Senator from Florida, all the other 
Members who led on this issue, and all of our colleagues for securing 
unanimous passage.
  While this bill moves forward, it is also important for the executive 
branch and our allies and partners around the world to fulfill their 
roles as well. Even before this new bill becomes law, Congress has 
already given the administration significant powers to act, including 
authorities to directly sanction individuals who violate human rights. 
I urge every trading nation around the world to look clearly at Hong 
Kong and at Xinjiang and imagine the costs as China continues to 
entrench its surveillance state and export it all around the world.
  The Senate continues to do our part. Everyone else must do theirs as 
well. The United States and the world must stand with Hong Kong.
