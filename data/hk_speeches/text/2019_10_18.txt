  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in defense of liberal 
democratic values and in solidarity with the people of Hong Kong. 
Earlier this week, the House passed legislation in support of these 
values and of human rights.
  A strong nation is one that does not turn to its worst instincts in 
the face of dissent. A strong nation does not see liberal democratic 
values as a threat. A strong nation tolerates differences in pursuit of 
prosperity for itself and prosperity for the world.
  To my fellow Americans, I say that we must not turn our backs on our 
principles in exchange for profit; we must not trade away our freedoms 
or be indifferent to those who yearn to be free.
  To the 2 million courageous young people in Hong Kong who marched, to 
those who are willing to fight for a prosperous future where their 
rights will be respected and where their freedoms will be protected: We 
are with you.
